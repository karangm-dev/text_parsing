I normally get a relaxation massage and decided to try a deep tissue for the first time. Holly, who has been a client of his since he opened, referred me to Oneself Therapy. When I arrived, Kenta made me feel welcomed and at ease. He was thorough in asking about my problem areas to be targeted and treated. This being my first deep tissue massage, Kenta asked about my comfort level through out the massage. I felt rejuvenated and tension free at the end of my session. Afterwards, he sat down with me and discussed a treatment plan that would work for me. I became a oneself member that day, this was a birthday gift to myself!
