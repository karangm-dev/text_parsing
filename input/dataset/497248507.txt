Not a fan......very pricey.....more than the "starts at" price.  I have bruises from the classic massage - "light to medium" pressure.  Also do not recommend the C and C scrub.  Just a sugar scrub, and then you hop in the shower.  Pluses are cleanliness.  Food.  Drink had no alcohol and was also pricey. Personal preference is a smaller spa.  This place is huge, loud, and not relaxing...and no room to sit at the pool midday.  Teeny tiny pool. Don't care for the forced 20% tip either.  I will tip well for great service , but this wasn't.Maybe I was there on a bad day and not so great a massage therapist? But due to price, lack of packages, lack of communication from massage therapist. I won't be back and think there are way better spas in Scottsdale, waaaaasy less expensive.
