The food here is absolutely amazing. We had my birthday planned for a different place, but immediately switched to Public School after eating here once. The food is out of this world, and the beer selection is amazing. I recommend the jidori chicken with jalapeno cornbread waffles. Make sure to ask for Vanessa as your server. She walked me through the extensive beer menu and even provided me with samples of her recommendations. Best service ive had ina  long time.
