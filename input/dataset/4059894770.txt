I was so excited for this place to open and was extremely disappointed when we finally visited. The line went to the door but we didn't wait too long to order. The restaurant was very loud and was a little messy. It was difficult to find a clean table. I just figured it was due to how busy it was. My husband ordered the double crust so I chose the original thin crust pizza. I also ordered a side Caesar salad. The ordering process was not very organized to begin with. They took your order and wrote your name on the paper that the pizza crust was placed on. After tells the next person what you wanted on your pizza, it was ready to go in the oven and you proceed to pay. We paid, got our drinks and found a place to sit and wait.  They call out your name when your pizza comes out which adds to the loud atmosphere and on top of it they seem to struggle to read the names they have written down as many of the papers get burned while baking and erases the name. Finally, after my husband and I received both pizzas we tried it. I was so disappointed in the taste of the sauce! It tasted like canned tomato sauce and the crust was extremely thin and looked like it was precooked. My husbands pizza was kept longer because of the double crust and you could see by the burnt paper underneath that it was in the oven a while yet his cheese wasn't even melted!This pizza was NOT good at all! Great concept (although it's not so new anymore) but not good. Save your money and don't try the new place--- go to Pizza Kitchen on Fort Apache instead. They are fantastic!
