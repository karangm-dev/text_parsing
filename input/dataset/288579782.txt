Antenna install.  Called for estimate was told $299 installed.  I asked if there were any other charges and was told possibly $20 to $30 extra to run a cable.  Set up the install and went well but was charged $299 plus $30 for cable plus a $55 trip charge.  I called Keith and left a message for him to call back and explain the additional $55 charge.  He never called me back.
