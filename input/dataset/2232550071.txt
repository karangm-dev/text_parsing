The people who give this place a bad review are either crazy or rich/stuck up. The bellagio buffet is so yummy. Husband & I have been there twice and loved it so much both times. (but we are middle class types, not expecting a fine dining experience at a buffet for goodness sakes). There's a huge selection and everything we tried was really good. Even the pasta & pizza which are normally gross at buffets, was good quality & delicious. The sushi area is great compared to other buffets, the crab legs (cold, but both snow & king) were amazing! The mashed potatoes were incredibly yummy. I seriously fantasize about this place all the time, the quality & selection are top notch, unless you're a huge snoot apparently.
