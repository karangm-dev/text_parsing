I checked out the reviews before I visited this pawn shop.  I was sadly disappointed, I thought I was walking into something I wouldn't regret.  I looked at a Rolex and the woman just seemed as though she didn't want to sell it to use because it had just arrived two weeks ago and therefore could not budge on the price.  We looked at a chain and the sales staff seemed disconnected and told us that there would be no savings, even on tax. It's been. Family business, I get it, but is being rude and I knowledgeable part of the family business??? Never going there again. They act as through they don't need your business becaus they  been there for 150 years. I will buy my Rolex elsewhere!!!!
