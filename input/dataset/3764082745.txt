I've dined at Hank's several times and each time it was truly excellent.  I base this 90% on meat quality and 10% on service...both of which are truly top notch.The atmosphere in Hank's is elegant and beautiful...it literally looks like they spent millions of dollars on it.  Great place to take a date or for a celebration.  But be prepared...it is anything but cheap.  $60 per person would be the bare minumum if you order a steak...but you won't feel ripped off afterwards.
