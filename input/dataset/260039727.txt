Today I got test results... From the imaging center the doctor ordered it from, because I couldn't get a hold of ANYONE at their office and they never once called or faxed it to me after a whole week, despite the imaging center faxing it *twice* to them. I eventually left the imaging center a voicemail after closing hours to fax it to me. They did the next morning. The nurse practitioner I saw (Dr. Angeleri?) suggested solutions completely irrelevant to my problems, did not read my medical history and the only good thing that came of it was an order for the imaging center they referred me to. No thanks.
