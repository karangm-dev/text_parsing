I feel like discount or bargain stores like Burlington Coat Factory are a hit or miss. Sometimes you luck out with incredible stuff and other times, you miss out.  I've never lucked out here.I give most stores that I see potential the rule of 5's... You miss a truck of new goodies, you're between seasons, etc. BCF, well, let's just say I've walked in 5 times and never bought anything... Not once.I think the big reason I've come away with nothing is the store set-up.  it's so crammed and so messy.  Bad store planning for the lay-out and inconsiderate shoppers who make a disgusting mess.  I did give an extra star for the staff. They've always been friendly and helpful, which always means a lot to me.I'd rather go anywhere else but BCF - Check the sale racks at Belk or head to Ross before you consider here.
