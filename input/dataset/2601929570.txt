Abuelo's is like a toned-down Chi-Chi's, or about what you'd expect from a strip mall restaurant.  Our server was a pro and the corn chips were light and tasty, but most of the food was slimy and bland. This is a good destination for a big, rowdy family because there is plenty of room for kids and the menu is very un-affronting American. It's a shame that this chain-style of restaurant dominates the dining landscape of our country.
