Tom's Urban was even better than we expected.  I took my fiance here for his birthday dinner.  We made an early reservation for 5:00pm on a Friday.  It was perfect for us because we don't like crowded restaurants. Our server Shwan, was great! He helped us pick out a couple of beers which we enjoyed very much.  We had the Sin City Burger and the Street Tacos plate.  The burger was delicious! Well cooked and the flavors really came together.  The fried egg was interesting and egg-citing!!! (sorry)  The egg had an earthy, home style flavor which complemented the richness of the bbq sauce and fried onions.I ordered the 5 taco place which included one of each kind of taco on the menu.  My favorite was the pork belly taco based on the mingling of sweet and tangy flavors.  The pork belly was a little bit off putting visually but it is like a think cut bacon.  The taco I enjoyed the least was the shrimp and lobster.  The sauces and fixings on the taco were overpowering to the lobster and shrimp. They were too heavy.  The shrimp and lobster would have been lovely with just a little pico de gallo, perhaps a tiny amount of butter sauce and a squeeze of lemon.  I ended up picking out the lobster and leaving the rest of the taco.  Finally were surprised with a free birthday dessert.  We really enjoyed ourselves.  I wish we were able to return next week.
