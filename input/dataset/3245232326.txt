I was putting together a rustic fire pit with my son in AZ and felt comfortable with my plan. I stopped by Galaxy to see if they had a propane/air mixing valve. Not only did Bruce have the valve, he had ALL the whistle free stainless steel flex tubing, piping and valves I needed at a fair price. Bruce's insightful recommendations allowed our final product to totally impress every one who has seen it. Thanks again for your help Bruce.
