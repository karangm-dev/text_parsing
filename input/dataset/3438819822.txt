Great quality, appetizers come fast, hot things take longer.tasty:treasure island (fun little sphere of sashimi with tasty sauces)fried cheese wonton(light and crispy with delightfully soft cheese)rock shrimp (a light crunch within a sauce covered shrimp makes this dish stand out)shrimp tempura (always nice)tempura ice cream with khalua(i believe this is a fine matcha ice cream, and the tempura pieces and kahlua is a nice touch but not overpowering)spider maki(soft-shell crab...absolutely delicious)green dragon roll (pretty basic tempura shrimp & avocado, but nice large serving if you feel like you can eat more and am reaching the 1.5hr limit)
