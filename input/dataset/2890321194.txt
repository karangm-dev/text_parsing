I just started coming here for lunch and I LOVE IT. The bartenders are amazing and very enthusiastic. The food is incredible. I am trying something new everyday and I have yet to be disappointed. If you need suggestions on what to get, you can always ask the bartenders. And they will go into very details on what is on the menu. The prices are very reasonable here as well . Since I will be coming here for lunch everyday. I want something that is well priced. And this place is jst that . TLDR; great price, great food, great service
