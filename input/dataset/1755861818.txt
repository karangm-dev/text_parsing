Lube is cheap, but unfortunately, so are the parts. And to think I drove around my SUV for 3000 miles with the oil filter they installed. After noticing spots of oil in the drive way I took it to Eco wash auto spa where they told me the oil filter was cheap and leaking from every side. I won't be servicing any vehicle here anymore nor would I recommend their services to anyone.
