Always good.  One of the best places to eat in the Phoenix area.  I always get the Purista, which has a generous helping of imported parma ham (prosciutto).  Get it with sliced sourdough so the amount of bread doesn't overwhelm the experience.  They have an excellent wine selection and much to choose from for imported Italian foods.  It gets busy, so plan ahead and bring someone with you to grab a table while you order.
