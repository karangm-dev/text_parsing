The pho it's self isn't bad at all, very little msg, decent meat/ home made meat balls. The problem with this place is the service, there is noooo service ! I would only come back if I was super desperate for pho. it's nice to have your drink topped off or be spoke to with respect. It could have been worse, but it could have been MUCH better! For what ever reason the spring roll was a little off as well almost a slight taste of curry, and a few things I don't normally find In my spring roll, I didn't like it and my friend found it odd too.   SERVICE IS KEY!!!!
