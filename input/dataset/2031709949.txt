This place is amazing! Be prepared for a wait BUT the staff is so efficient and gets you in quick! We were looking for a bigger lunch to fill us up on our last day, something we couldn't get in Seattle and this fit the bill! My husband got the pulled pork. This was the third time that between the two of us we had pulled pork on this trip, this was hands down the best! It's a LOT of food, so be prepared. Come hungry lol. I got the bacon mac and cheese burger. It's huge. It's in your face. It's delicious. Seriously. The only thing that would have made it better is if the burger patty (which was amazing) was swapped out for the pulled pork my husband had!All and all, great service, great atmosphere and great food! We will be back next time we are in Vegas!
