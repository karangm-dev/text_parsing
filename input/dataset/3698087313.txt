I'm a big fan of fresh typically visiting the location on bloor at dinner time when it's packed! Today I was at the one on spadina for a lunch meeting so I didn't have the time to complain but my standard order beach bowl was far below expectation! The sweet potatoes in it were burned and they clearly didn't care to quality check each ingredient. My colleague ordered extra sweet potato instead of tofu or goat cheese and they put extra avocado instead but we were pressed on time so said nothing. Restaurant was also half empty so no excuse of being busy - I've never had an issue at fresh on bloor even with hour wait times some nights and packed seating. I love fresh but have to say something for today. Hopefully the business will read this and do something for a loyal fresh fan!
