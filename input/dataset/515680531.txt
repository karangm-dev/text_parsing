This is the best hidden gem in the West Valley! All the ice cream is homemade and you know you're getting the best stuff by the first taste. There are so many delicious flavors to sample. I highly recommend a scoop (or two) of peanut butter explosion! Mighty Moo is family owned and operated. You feel right at home when you walk in the door. We frequent this spot on the weekends because it is some of the best ice cream I've ever had! Support local!
