We were in Pickle Bills Aug 5th for my sisters birthday gathering.There were 7 in our party,we spent a significant amount of money for what we felt was Subpar service.Our Food was ok,nothing spectacular.I've  never experienced the level of unprofessionalism as we did with Alyssa!She was the Epitome of rudeness and unprofessionalism.My sister,who birthday we were celebrating,was attempting to order a drink,Alyssa cut her off in mid sentence to say "I'll be right right back I have to go cash them out!"We all  looked at each other and said  that this was beyond Rude and Tacky!and thought,She can't be serious!It was Unacceptable behavior and we should have left as it only got worse!She walked away a 2nd time to go to another table as if we were inconveniencing her by taking up too much of her time to place our orders!In addition,my significant other asked her "what beers do you have on tap"?Her response was as she pointed "there's a menu right there!This again  was Rude ,Tacky and Unprofessional!She failed to Impress!His mussels were cold,she didn't offer an apology or ask if he wanted something else.She said"you want me to take them off?Horrible Waitrress/service!!!She never brought his coleslaw until we were paying the check.She  then asked if he wanted it to go?This will be my last time patronizing this restaurant and paying for inferior service.I emailed Pickle Bills regarding my concerns,it isn't a surprise that I wasn't contacted.
