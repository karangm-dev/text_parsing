Words can't even express our dissatisfaction with our recent Mr. Rooter experience. An initial estimate telling us they would need to dig underneath our sidewalk (for $7,000 mind you) to fix a broken pipe that would take a max of 4 days...turned into a 9-day debacle of delays including having to rent more digging equipment (how did they not know what equipment would be required?). Then, when they were "done" and hadn't dug within 3 feet of the sidewalk, we were given a shady explanation about how they weren't sure if they break was "down" or "out"...conveniently they didn't have to dig as far as they originally said they would.Additionally, one day they left a gigantic, gaping hole in our yard without attempting to cover or mark it off at all. If a kid had slipped off the sidewalk in front of our house and fallen in the hole, who do you think would be liable?! And when they attempted to put our yard back together, they didn't bother to pick all of the rocks out of the dirt or level the yard back out so we'd have a prayer of regrowing our ruined grass. They also broke our sprinklers and left them without telling us (all pictures of this damage and carelessness attached). All in all a terrible experience that we would not recommend to anyone.
