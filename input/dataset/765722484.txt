This has gone from being the best Starbucks in Las Vegas to one of the worst. The service tends to be on the rude side these days. They close extremely early. While most Starbucks close at 10, this place closes like at 7 or 8. There is never any tables open if you want to use the wifi. The same people loiter here all day long, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. My last drink here tasted like some guy  grabbed a stale cookie, crushed it in the palm of his hand, and dropped it into water mixed with chocolate syrup. It didn't even taste like coffee. There is no such thing as half n half here. It's so loud in here that you have to scream in order for the barista to hear you. It's so loud in here that you won't hear the barista scream your name when your drink is ready. There is a group  of middle-age men who sit outside with their puppies in order to get the attention of cutie-pie teenage girls. These guys have been doing this for so long that the puppies are now full grown dogs. Also remember how this is Summerlin so everyone acts like they are 11 years old. They will complain about every little thing. If you are standing in line, the guys behind you will constantly keep bitching about how they hate waiting in line. This happens at every Summerlin business I go to. Why are Summerlin folks so impatient? The parking lot in this particular area of the shopping center is very cramped. Either these people drive really bad or they are confused and think that this Starbucks has a drive-thru. I don't know how many times I narrowly avoided death in this parking lot.  These days I go to the Starbucks in Centennial near Floyd Lamb Park. The internet is much quicker, and they close at 10.
