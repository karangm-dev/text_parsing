I used to love Morton's and recommend them to others. I've given other locations 5-star reviews in three cities. But this is my first visit since they were bought by Landry's and there is a marked drop in overall quality. The meat presentation is gone, and neither filet was as tender and flavorful as in the past. They cooked medium-rare perfectly, but medium was overcooked (probably carry over, I would stick to med-rare from now on). I couldn't believe that the creme brulee had no custard flavor, stick with the molten cake. The service was still good, if missing the flair of the meat presentation.I won't be back, or recommend Morton's to others anymore.
