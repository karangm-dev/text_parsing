I was in Vegas on vacation this past week and stopped by after an afternoon on Fremont Street. It was 5:29 and I really wanted to get some Poker Chips, seeing they were closing at 5:30, they let me in and allowed me to make my purchase. Really awesome customer service! A must stop if you are in Vegas!
