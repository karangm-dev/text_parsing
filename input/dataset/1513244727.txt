Ok.So I've been wanting to try out this salon for a while. I am still on the hunt for the best brazillian in Toronto. I went online and liked the funny casual approach to their marketing so I tried to book an appointment online.Now, I don't have a credit card. Don't want one. Never have. And I'm not getting one any time soon. In the online appointment booking feature you need a credit card to secure your appointment. As I've just mentioned. I don't have one. So I called them directly for an appointment. The woman on the phone said that it was part of their cancellation policy to get a credit card number and secure the amount for services in order to book an appointment. And since I didn't have one I would need to come into their store and buy a gift card for the value of my service. So basically they insist that you pay for your service before those services have been rendered. And if you don't, they don't want your business. Are you kidding me? I understand a company trying to ensure that their appointments are kept and that they are bringing in money. That's fine. But this is pretty extreme and seems a bit dishonest. I need to leave and go to the salon and buy a $65 gift card for myself just so I can book an appointment for a wax and an eyelash tint? No. Not going to happen. If their services are as good as they boast, I could have potentially been a frequent and loyal customer. But I don't make it a habit of just handing companies money when all I've done is speak with someone briefly on the phone.  This place is lame and I'm taking my business elsewhere.
