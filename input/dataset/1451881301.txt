We were referred here from a friend when we moved into the area, my husband (who is terrified of the dentist) needed a root canal and a cleaning. Both procedures (and the crown that followed) were quick and easy- the team was very accommodating of my hubby's phobia. In fact, on his third visit he didn't even need me to go with! Very Impressive Heatherwood- keep up the good work!!
