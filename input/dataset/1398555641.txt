Great place. A different slant on traditional sushi. They use sauces and for the rolls recommended by yelpers, the H3 and the OMG roll instead of seaweed on the outside, was a fat piece of avocado or fish. Different.The Jalape√±os with crab were the tits if you like spicy!The H3 roll was spicy and creamy. I really liked it. The OMG roll is a bit of a show, I found the smoked flavour a little sickening, but nothing terrible.Service was first class and the owner is a real character.
