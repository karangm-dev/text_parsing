This was the first of the "casual" fun dining places I remember going to growing up. As a matter of fact I had three first dates here, and my first legal drink.Everyone in my family who would go to Ground Round on Sunday afternoon could not get over the fact that there were free peanuts and that you disposed of the shells by throwing them on the floor, except for my clean freak mother who put her shells in a paper napkin then politely handed them to the waitress.Chicken fingers: this was the first place that I can recall that had chicken fingers on the menu, and for some reason we were infatuated with them. Ground Round's as I recall were very tasty, crunchy, delicious and served with bar b que  sauce. We were also in disbelief that Ground Round offered FREE refills on soft drinks, OMG free refills? WOW! This was how the rich people dined.... Lol.When my older cousin got married he even had his bachelor party here as well as the rehearsal dinner, damn we were in love with Ground Round. Age catches up with us, and taste buds mature, and arteries clog and places like the Ground Round start to become faded memories. Someday when I pass a ground round in my travels I will stop in, throw a peanut shell or two on the floor and toast the three girls i happily dined here with and remember the departed family members that I spent hours with here on Sunday afternoons.
