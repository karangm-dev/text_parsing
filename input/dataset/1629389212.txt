Gross. This place gets nothing right... Carne asada was bland and tasteless, chicken was burned, tortillas tasted like they were bought at vons or albertsons (and were barely heated) and next time I want nachos with cheese wiz on them instead of REAL cheese, I'll go to the local 7-11... My wife is tossing this crap as I'm writing this. What a mistake to go here to give them a shot, best thing that came out of this is the idea that I never has to do it again.
