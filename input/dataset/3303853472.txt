Great spa. We went for the couples painting party and massage. It was a lot of fun. You get your own steam room/massage suite for the whole period as well as use of the outer seating area. The suite has a big shower, adjacent to the steam room so you can come out and take a break if the heat gets too much.They leave the salt scrub and mud in the steam room so you can scrub up, wash off and then hang out in the steam room. They also give you water, prosseco and juice. The steam room runs for about 45 mins and then all you need to do is lay on the massage tables and the therapists show up. I had Kathy and she was excellent. So often these type of massages are very light and just for relaxation but Kathy beat me up, which is what I wanted.Excellent day, well worth the money for a special occasion.
