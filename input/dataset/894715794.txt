I can not attest to the food as I was never served.  I was asked to leave this establishment based on my level of intoxication.   As a former bar manger I found this discretion odd, especially considering my intake of only 3 beers during the 4 hours of a Pittsburg Pirates game.   I was legally able to navigate a motor vehicle, but I was unable to eat a bowl spaghetti at this restaurant.   I asked to speak to the manager and asked why we would not be served.  Blame was passed to the server who passed it back to the manager who had zero explanation.  Zero.    The only thing that makes any sense to us was that they close at midnight and we showed up at 11.   If you don't want to serve food past a certain point then don't, but don't insult the people who have decided to dine at your establishment.  I am personally embarrassed and completely disappointed in how the server and his manager handled the situation.  As a business owner myself I feel bad for the owner of this business that has enlisted these people to take care of his business.
