I called in for an electric problem in my home.  I spoke with Mike from Dodge Electric.  Mike helped me troubleshoot the issue over the phone and helped me to resolve the problem.  Mike was very helpful, professional and very knowledgeable.  I was very impressed with Dodge Electric and will be contacting them for future projects.
