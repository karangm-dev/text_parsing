We have been doing business with this home warranty company for over 20 years and here's why!  Rachel (in their office)  once again exceeded our expectations in a claim we made this week.  She followed up several times with us to make sure we were happy with their services.  Carlos, one of their supervisors, came personally to our house to correct an issue, and it was resolved within minutes.  We would highly recommend this company to anyone looking for a great home warranty!
