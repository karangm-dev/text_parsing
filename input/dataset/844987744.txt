Don't ask me why I keep frequenting chain restaurants -- I must be a glutton for punishment.  So, I've been to this Outback a few times before, I used to order the prime rib, but it had come out so fatty the past few times that I stopped ordering it.  Last night, I met a couple friends here and this time I ordered the Outback Special Sirloin with the lobster and mushroom topping (an extra $3.95)  for the more "indulgent steak experience," as stated on the menu.  So the appetizer and salad came out fine, no problems thus far.  Then the steak came out.  It was cooked fine, but they forgot to include the lobster and mushroom topping for the more indulgent steak experience.  I told my server nicely that they had forgotten the topping and he assured me that it would be right out. The steak was decent and cooked correctly, however I was disappointed because the lobster and mushroom topping came out 10 minutes after my steak, which was cold by now and the "topping"  wasn't really a lobster topping with mushrooms, it was more of a lobster bisque with mushrooms.  If I had known it was going to be so disappointing, I wouldn't have bothered to wait for it while my steak got cold.  It would have been nice if the server apologized and took the "topping" off my bill (yes, it was just $3.95 but it's the principle of the matter), or offered a free dessert, but there was no accountability.  I don't expect to have another indulgent steak experience at Outback anytime soon.
