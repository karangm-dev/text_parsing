This firm place a facebook add indicating no service fee.I called and made an appointment, prior to appointment I received a call asking if I would mind changing from Friday to Monday. Since my plumbing problem was not urgent I agreed.Well monday came and at nood when I not received call I called them and the lady I talked too didn't seem to know about my service request but said she would contact plumber. I didn't hear from plumber and they simply were a no show. I would not suggest use of this service
