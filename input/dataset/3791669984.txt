No kitchen which is a real drawback for me as I enjoy some good food when I drink.Overpriced.  A tiny glass of beer for what you pay for a full-size regular beer mug at other pubs.Very small space and you can barely move around.Noise level is too much for my ears. Not bad until you get people there.Not for me as there are better places for me to spend my moola.I was leaning more towards one star but I didn't due to the gracious servers.
