Am a HUGE Beatles fan, but am not a fan of cheap sentiment, and that's were this show lost me.  I did enjoy the dancing/acrobatics of about 4-5 of the numbers, but the rest of it has pure horror.  I felt as though the show was trying to turn the Beatles into something it wasn't, something more along the lines of Pink Floyd's The Wall movie, which I love, but I do not think you can paint the Beatles with the same brush, and even if you could, let's see something original.  Massive waste if $114.00.
