So apparently you need 2 tickets at the bakery, one to get your baked goods and one to pay for it?  At least that's what the short Hispanic lady with peppered short hair insinuated while I was waiting to check out.  I literally watched a customer walk in the store while I was waiting to check out.  She ordered her food came to the line and was getting helped right away, right in front of me.  The cashier looked at me and said I can help you as soon as I'm done with her, because she got a number?!  I told her that I got a number already, she asked what it was "44" I replied, and that didn't even matter.  She definitely got me off on the right foot this morning! Needless to say I just walked off and went to the extremely chipper gentleman that's awesome all the time and got helped right away.I thought that was extremely unprofessional and rude!  I usually come here often because I work down the street.  Might have to take my business elsewhere now, due to lack of attention.
