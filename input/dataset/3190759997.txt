Im actually really pleased with the results.. To be honest, I didn't expect too much since I never really had good experiences with eyelash extensions.. other than eyelash lifts but I figured that if my friends recommended then it won't hurt to give them a try. Upon reading the reviews, they were right... if you want your lashes done for an event ALWAYS book a few wks in advance since they're quite popular with their own regular customers. With my busy schedule at work, Kitty was kind enough to coordinate with my many changes and demands.The store itself was an open concept and with two beds side by side each other... allowing the customers and technician to chat openly.  I arrived at the store quite early and was greeted by Kitty & Gina. Both ladies were welcoming. Although, they were both at work with their customers... Gina came over & gave me a booklet to review to see which lashes I wanted done. Gina recommended a few options for me but I later chose the express set 80 lashes 2D. She was quite professional & didn't try to up sell me with the expensive options, rather she tried to tailor the options to my preferences. My left eye stung a lot during the application by Gina was able to address it appropriately. At the end of the application, I was given a little care bag with a few tools & tips to help care for the new lashes. All in all, I would definitely go back to this salon & recommend others. I mean I've already gotten a few comments from my boyfriend & my friends about my lashes asking me where I got them done. I think I would prefer if the beds were separated by a wall with a little more privacy or something. But I'm not complaining too much considering it's a small business.4.8/5
