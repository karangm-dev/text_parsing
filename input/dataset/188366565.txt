Let me start off by saying the massage was actually pretty good !! The issue is with the "Aka " manger that does nothing but take ur payments try to humiliate you on the way out ... I bought 10 gift cards from them around Christmas girl was so nice and started bowing I even left her a 5$ tip for writing all of them out on a paper business card  since it was my girlfriends birthday week we decided to final use them as we're leaving all relaxed and loving life ..she tells me as I'm leaving a tip on my card that she forgot her wallet and gave the guy the only five she had in her purse can I leave some extra money for him as she tells me this the guy comes over and sticks the five next to the TIP  NATZI  he starts waving the five in the air in front of ppl sitting in the waiting area and keeps yelling MASSAGE NO GOOD over and over looking at my girlfriends and I become in raged so I tell him that's not good enough and he gives me a bunch of excuses on why it's not last time I checked tips are optional and if he wants to get technical 15% was an extra 2.50 what an asshole to ruin her birthday celebration over that and lost a lot of ppl that I was going to refer to them they have no shame we can't be the only ones he has done this to he looked like a pro so SHAME ON YOU TRASH CAN you got me all relaxed just to shoot my blood pressure up and give me a migraine all day !! Never coming here again
