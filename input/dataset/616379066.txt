BAD SERVICE went to this place tonight even though many times in the past I've had a mediocre meal and poor service.  Tonight however 6 of us showed up, we saw two friends and they came to sit with us.  At the end of the night however we asked our waitress, who always seemed to come to us with a chip on her shoulder, if we could all have separate bills.  This would have netted her a bigger tip and allowed us to pay with our cards, however we were handed a bill that included the two that joined and were told that because there were 8 of us we now had to pay one bill with a added 18% (above 15% average).  Now one person had to cover the card while the others scrounged for cash, also those who thought the service and or food sucked were forced to pay a 18% tip.  If it were up to me we would have just left enough money to cover the price of the dinner/drinks and left.  This poor service will insure that I will never return, nor will the others with me, and I will make sure to tell as many as I can.  Poor service and bad policy equal lost business period.  Its a shame, but even in 2015 businesses take advantage of their customers thinking that poor customer service will still win the game.   My suggestion to those who read this, is avoid this place and enjoy one of the other many places on Queen West that will earn your business, rather then feel entitled to it.  1 out of 5 my worst yelp review yet.
