I would have to say I had the worst experience visiting this property. The assistant property manager was so unprofessional. As we walked through the door she did not even acknowledge us. One of the other leasing agents informed us that she was off and that we needed to wait for the Assistant Manager. The apartments are so awkward. They are so small. If you have the opportunity to view others properties do it.
