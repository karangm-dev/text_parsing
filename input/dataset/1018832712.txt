Cox, the worst internet service and the worst customer service ever ever ever ever ever! I do not want to give them one star,  zero is more appropriate. I hope they realize if they're going to keep customers they need to greatly improve their customer service. I hope we can all find a better internet provider out there! They obviously need more competition and perhaps that would make them treat their customers better!
