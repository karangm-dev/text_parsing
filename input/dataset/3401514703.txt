I don't know why I even bothered coming here again today when I wasn't happy the last time they "cleaned" my car. I used to get told if I wanted my interior wiped down I needed to go to the vip wash and today was told if I wanted my interior wiped down I needed some $70 package because vip only dusted the interior not wiped down. Oh but don't worry I was offered a happy hour special of $10 off so $60 total (rolling my eyes at this) how does wiping my cars interior add $35  on to my package?? Seriously someone explain this that's more than the entire vip package!! Ok.. whatever I'll wipe it off when I get home no sweat off my back . So receive my car. Found 5 straw wrappers on my floor board, dog hair all over the dash(so much for that dusting) and hair all over my seats, the windshield has bugs all over it still and the car has black marks on it! So pretty much I say no to you're ridiculous package and get "punished" by doing a sh** job on my car! Have to attend a wedding this weekend out of town and now get to add wash car to the list before leaving. And I tipped those people! Such crap! Don't waste your money !
