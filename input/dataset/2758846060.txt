I am writing this review in my HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT in VAN the owner. I have been going to ms nails since I Was in JR high school. I have ALWAYS been loyal customer and even took my nails off when they under went there renovations.The last few times I have always seemed to get into a argument with Hanna. She makes my nails crooked and thick and all different lengths. Today was my final straw with ms nails. I went in and told her the color # of the tip I wanted she then processed to do her own thing. In the end after being 100% unhappy with my nails I told her to call van(the owner) where van said nothing and asked to put Hanna on the phone after there conversation in not one word of English Hanna told me I didn't have to pay and I went on my way. 30 some min later I was contacted by phone from Van telling me to go back and pay for the sh*t nails I had just had done. Telling me that the service was completed and thus far Hanna had done her job. If you are reading this PLEASE DON'T GO THERE!! It's a 45$ plus to have a bunch a girls talk bad about you in another language!!!! VAN I AM TRULEY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU!!
