Rabba's is basically your average grocery store, except it's smaller with less merchandise and also located on a strange stretch of the street. I only come by in case of emergencies and even then I'd rather go to a different grocery store.They don't have any particular deals (or a rewards program) that will cause the average consumer to say, "I have to go to Rabba's!" It's not bad but not good either, and certainly not impressive.It kind of reminds me 7-11 with its aisles and aisles of cold drinks and ice cream, so Rabba's has more of a convenience store vibe than a grocery store. Perfect for quick snacks but not quite worthy of spending oodles of money for produce!
