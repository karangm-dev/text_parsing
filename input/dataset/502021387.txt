Everyone at this firm is professional and kind. Deciding to file bankruptcy is a very stressful decision and can be cumbersome at least. I would recommend this firm to any one hands-down, they made me feel extremely comfortable during the entire process and guided me in the way that I needed. My case was a little different and they were prepared to handle it just as hard as they would any one else's case. I am very pleased with my results and they even give you tools to continue on to raise your credit after everything is said and done and it works!!!
