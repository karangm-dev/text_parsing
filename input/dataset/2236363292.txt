Listen don't complain that you got in late or the guy at the door was rude if you get there if you get there past 11pm who do you think you are the Kardashians?! I mean seriously I get bottle service every single time and I do not get there later than 10-1030 pm sure the club may still be empty but i would muchhh rather hang out at my sickkk table than wait in a line for 2 hours. AMAZING CLUB if you have game you willl have fun I highly recommend a table it is keyyy because you get tired of dancing for a few hours you go back to your table with some chicks hang out for a quick 20 then your back at it going nuts!
