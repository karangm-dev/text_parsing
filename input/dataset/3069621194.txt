I love this place. It's a wonderful place to bring your puppy for a lunch date. The members of the staff are always attentive and cheerful. Lazy Dog's offers many appetizing sections from their vast menu (So far my favorite item is their, Roast Beef Dip sandwich and their pot roast) and they also have a dog friendly menu.
