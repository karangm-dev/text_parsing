Without a doubt, I think I would have to say that this place... is probably the best chinese food in Toronto :) Okay price wise it's probably one of the most expensive... but every dollar spent on this restaurant was totally worth it!We ordered a prix fix menu, which had a variety of choices :) Their dim sum are some of the best I'VE ever had. and lets just say i've had my fair share of dim sum in my days here on Earth lol. Anyway, even though it was just a sample, those flavours, omg, they just stay with you! I can't quite put into words how delish it is, but just all the flavours that Susur lee uses... Love his cooking! the rice dish that came with our menu, was also super delicious. Again, it's more of an elegant twist to Chinese dishes, but certainly a delightful one, because I enjoyed every spoonful of that rice!The desserts at the end... omg. a trio. and each one of them so unique and different that i just dind't have much to say at the end (i was just enjoying bites of the three different desserts!).  Anyway, yes I know the dishes offered at this restaurant isn't cheap, but if anyone is looking to spend some good money towards a top of the line chinese style dining, this is the place :)This place is super busy though, so do make sure you reserve! They have some seats along the kitchen where you can also look at the chefs preparing the food :)
