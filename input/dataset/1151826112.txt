I highly recommend Tailored Living.  We had them redo our double an d single car garages with epoxy.  They had to remove the old epoxy first and then apply the new epoxy.  Jerry and his assistant did a first class job in every way.  They also made an additional cabinet for our single car garage.  We love it, just what we wanted. They are very reasonably priced as well.
