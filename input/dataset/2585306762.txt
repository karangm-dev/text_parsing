I really enjoyed the breakfast. I had the short rib benedict and my friend had the green chili pork tostada with 2 eggs over easy on top. For the restaurant just being open for 2 days I thought all in all things were good.  We sat at the bar and had very good service and the prices we very reasonable. I will be going back for breakfast at least once a week.
