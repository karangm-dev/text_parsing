We dropped by on a Saturday afternoon for lunch.  It was my first time at the restaurant but my wife had previously went with her family about a month ago.  The restaurant is large with tons of tables.  Only a few of the tables were filled during our time there.  I ordered a bento box with sushi, sashimi, and tempura.  I had Zipang for lunch the day previous, so my review might be a little bias.  The nigiri sushi rice was a little too large and too tightly packed for my liking.  It should really be packed enough to pick up by a pair of chopsticks but falls apart in your mouth without much chewing.  The fish in the sushi and sashimi were not that fresh to be honest and were thinly cut.  The saving grace was the tempura, which I thought was quite good.    Overall, for the given price, there are better sushi options around.  Maybe their thing isn't sushi/sashimi but it makes up a large part of their menu.  To be honest, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.  If I happened to be here another time, I would order their cooked food instead.
