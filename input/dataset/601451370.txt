Dr' Hyson has the personality of a turnip, and has the worst bedside manner I have ever seen. A typical appointment with him goes like this: He comes into the examine room, mumbles an indistinguishable greeting, looks at lab tests, reads the report to you, without making any eye contact at any time and expects you to understand the results without further explanation. If you ask a question, you are treated like you are the stupidest person on earth. If you dare to ask him to do anything, he probably won't do it,. If by some miracle he does, it is accompanied by stern statements, no matter what it is, that he is doing you a "favor" and it's "not my job". After multiple sessions with him, from what I can see, he views his "job" as ordering tests, reading the results to you without explanation, and billing your insurance for an hours time after spending 1 or 2 minutes with you.The office staff (run apparently by his wife) is rude, incompetent,, and extremely arrogant.All in all, this was the most miserable medical experience of my life. Dr. Hyson, who is certified as a Psychiatrist, should more appropriately, be the patient of one. His attitude and demeanor absolutely do  not match up with a profession of helping or treating others and he rather reminds me of a person with autism who is incapable of improving social skills or interacting appropriately with others;  His people skills are so bad that I wonder how he keeps his practice going. Run, don't walk from this office. You'd be better off getting medical services at the city dog pound, and probably be treated better to boot.
