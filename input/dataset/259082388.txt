Terry (the owner) has been fixing my car for years and has done consistently great work. I completely trust his opinion when he tells me what he thinks is wrong or what the course of action should be. I have seen many of his projects over the years in many different stages of completion and they always look and run superbly. The shop itself is always full of cars from all different decades in for all different types of work, and the reception area is all made up in a tiki-type theme so when you visit you will definitely have something cool to look at while you wait. I would recommend this shop to anyone with an old car that needs fixing, whether that means getting an oil change or having major restoration work done.
