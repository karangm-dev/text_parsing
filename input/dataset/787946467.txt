This is be second time that I've ate here, and both times I was really pleased. I've gotten the Alaskan Crepe with smoked salmon and creme cheese and while I've never had a crepe (or at least a real crepe that didn't come from be frozen food section), if this is an indication of how a crepe should be, then I'm a fan. The savory crepes like mine come with a small, spring mix salad with a light oil dressing. The meal was light but left me satisfied while out and about.      I took my mom out for a late lunch and she had an egg crepe. She added bacon and a side of avocado. She only ate half, so I of course willingly finished it. The egg was done perfectly. I believe there was Brie in there which added a nice creaminess, and the bacon added that hint of salt that really made it for me.     Lastly we split a dessert crepe, it had maple syrup, walnuts, creamy cheese inside, and a side of whip cream. The waitress suggested strawberries and it was a good call. They were fresh and added a nice, clean taste to the dish. I definitely hope to stop back soon. The only real negative is that the place is a bit small. It's not a place I'd hit if you're in a decently sized group.
