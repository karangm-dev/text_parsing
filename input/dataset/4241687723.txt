It wasn't the best we've ever had, nor was it the worst we've ever had. Nothing stood out as being above average. Our favorite things there were the kimchi and the chicken wraps, but those are hard to mess up, so thats not saying much. The speed of the servers and the kitchen staff made this place a convenient lunch location during conference days, but other than that, 'meh' is the perfect description for Noodle Asia.
