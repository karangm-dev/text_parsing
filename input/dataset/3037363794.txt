Came here for lunch and no one else was in the place. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with nothing on it and fries and my dad ordered fried chicken sandwich w cheese and fries. The bartender said fries came with it. We also got glasses of coke that tasted stale and disgusting. The bartender was very unattending. The grilled chicken sandwich was chewy and almost inedible. The fries were also gross and not even ranch could save them. The place was clean but that was the only good thing about it. I couldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. Also, the check came and the fries for one meal were included but they were extra on another even though we ordered the same special. I asked the bartender about it and she just said, "I don't know" and didn't make any attempt to correct it. The drinks came in tiny glasses and are $2.50. On top of that, they billed the drinks separate from the food so we paid tax twice. I like to support local places but this was just stupid.
