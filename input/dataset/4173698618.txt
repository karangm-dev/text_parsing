LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I came here with a few other people on a weeknight. We were immediately greeted and ready to be served whenever. The drinks were awesome despite the fact that I don't care for whiskey much. The New Fashion and Smuttynose were my favorites. The tables have beer and liquor on tap for you to kind of do like a self-serve options. Very cool. While it's a western bar and some people get into it with cowboy boots galore, not everyone dresses up western style so don't be worried!! I plan to come back here.
