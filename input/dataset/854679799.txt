Fantastic food.  Very good.  I lived in Greece for a few months and totally enjoyed the food there.  This Kyklos is as close to authenticate as your going to get.  The staff was very nice and polite.  A totally enjoyable experience.  If I had to ding then on anything, it would be that there tziki sauce needs a bit more cucumber in it
