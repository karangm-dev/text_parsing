How fabulous to have such a fantastic place open late at night. Most food late night is fast food. Pizza seems like the only choice, so it was so great to find a real restaurant by such a great chef open late to serve hungry people. We attended a concert on a Monday and we didn't get out until very late and were needed to eat some food. This place did not disappoint. We got seated right away and our waiter was amazing. He was incredibly on point with the menu and able to answer any questions from our group. My husband and I shared a salad and a burger. I told the waiter that  we were sharing and they evenly split both items, which was really great. The Cesar salad was simple but the dressing was amazing and evenly coated the lettuce. It came with cherry tomatoes and unlike most restaurants that serve things that look like tomatoes but never actually tastes like them, these were amazing, they were sweet and actually tasted like a real tomato. The burger was delicious and cooked to perfection. It came with fries too which were great.Three of us all got  the same burger. One friend got a pepperoni pizza and was very pleased and someone got the crab cakes. Once the food arrived no one spoke, everyone amerced themselves in eating and everyone was incredibly pleased. there were several cocktails - two moscow mules and I had an amazing cocktail here is was a lima sour I believe and it was plum/lime inspired. I ordered it because I had never heard of it and it was great. Two thumbs up and my first visit to a Wolfgang Puck restaurant. If/when we are in MGM I plan on eating here again.
