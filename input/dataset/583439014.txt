We were really impressed by this little find.  There was not a whole lot going on at the Lake Las Vegas Village, its pretty empty, however this place was the gem others described it as on here.  We found both the food and service to be impeccable.  Certainly worthy of being on the strip, or the streets of San Francisco.  The Classic Onion Soup, Beet Salad, Lamb and Salmon were all amazing.  I would definitely recommend!
