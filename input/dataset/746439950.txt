New owners, Jill and Randy are awesome. There is a new menu that serves lunch only, it is so worth it. Randy makes homemade soup every day - amazing. Jill bakes wonderful treats every day, too! If you tried this place before and wasn't impressed, please give it another shot. It's worth it, you will not be disappointed.
