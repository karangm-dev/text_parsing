Not great but not bad. Short: tiny cramped salon. Unfriendly techs but nails came out really good. Also probably shouldn't get your lashes done here... they have the stations out in the same room as the nail and pedicure stations so imagine... you're getting your lashes done while nail dust is flying around. Pretty unsanitary if you ask me. Long: i was a walk in for an acrylic full set. They told me 10 min which was great. Vanessa was my nail tech and probably the most unfriendly I've met. Greeted me but that was about it. No small talk or even an attempt. We get started and her station is next to another tech doing a gel set. Several times during my appt Vanessa looked over and said whatever to the other tech. Seemed like she was maybe training her? Not sure. There was a point that Vanessa got up and went behind this tech which she never mentioned anything if she was helping out or what but this left me awkwardly sitting there. I don't mind if she was training the girl but she should've let me know. The appt took about 45 min which is pretty fast for a full set but I can't complain they are very nice. Great color and shape is good too. The only thing that caught me off guard was usually after an appt you get lotion and a little hand rub right? Well I guess not at this place. Vanessa literally pushed my hands away and told me I was done. Honestly can't say I'll be back.
