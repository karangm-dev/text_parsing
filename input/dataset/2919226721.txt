You can either get a bowl of rice or a giant hand roll aka sushi burrito. You get 2 scoops of fish/ protein and you can dress up your dish with all the veggies you like. Avocado costs extra. They're open for lunch and late into the evening so I can grab a quick, light dinner if I've been working late. The restaurant is really big for what they serve. It seems like this place could be half the size since so much of their business is "to go." But I do love that it's a local spot in a busy shopping center so I can get my errands done and grab a bite at the same time.
