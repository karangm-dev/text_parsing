This store is in absolute chaos. The strange old man behind the counter tries to help 3 customers at once, talking to multiple people in one breath without looking up. Very hard to tell who he's talking to. Waited over 60 minutes for a 4:00 appointment. Never even bothered to apologize. The old man then gave incorrect info about insurance info, recommended applying for an insurance payment we don't qualify for then rambled to someone else for 30 minutes before we could leave.Obnoxious, incompetent and inefficient. Take your business literally anywhere else. They should do the dignified thing and just close shop.
