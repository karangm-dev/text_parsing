Disappointing.  I usually love this place but the hostess was rude and the waitress wasn't the nicest either.  On top of it, I ordered something new-the tilapia and shrimp.  It smelt so bad!!  I tried to get over the smell but it was tough.  Fish was soggy and just not good altogether.  I would suggest a different location? I've never had a bad experience at this place before.
