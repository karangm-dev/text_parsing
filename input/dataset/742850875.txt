Organized a dinner with close friends, we were 8 and it was amazing. I know I will come back and so will my friends. Excellent service and food! One of us is vegan and had a salad, I tasted it out of curiosity.. it was purple-ish and spiced as I could taste a little garlic and it was just so good. I had the duck which was cooked perfectly, a mix of sweet and not sweet and the veggie mash it came with had a complexed tasty sweet taste. That same mash others had, was so good we had to ask the server what it was. Sorry I forgot the name but it wasn't potato and the server said its made with love and alot of butter. To me it tasted like heaven.For desert I had the beignet which came with a salty caramel sauce..... that sauce.... just thinking about it I salivate and I'm not really a desert person.We took pictures outside and one of the owners ( 1 of the 3 brothers) came outside to take picture of all of us. Did I say service was great? It was!For us 8 it was our first time and not our last. Reasonably priced and for what you're getting it feels like a steal. I've paid way more for mediocre food.  For the record, I personally don't know the owners and was not paid to put this review but I felt compelled to brag about this place and hopefully I get to eat here again.I took pictures of some of the plates so I keep in mind what I'll try next when I come back to Montreal.FYI they have a share meal that some had which included the duck with fish and ribs with that mash... I will be back
