Found this place as i was driving downtown. I immediately decided to check it out. I was very impressed. The decor takes me back to new york in the soho district. I love the ambiance. I also was very pleased with my food. we got there at 5:50 and i thought oh no im going to miss happy hour but both our hostess and waiters were accommodating. They made sure we got our happy hour before the clock struck 6. The mac and cheese balls were good a little kick with a perfect crunch. The chicken sliders were soooooo good mash potatoes on the bottom bun with a slaw and aioli the chicken fried to a crispy and crunchy perfection! The truffle fries  ahhhhh they were yummy the cheese truffle sauce to dip them im was instantly on my radar. I am not an ipa drinker but my friend got two, the first one may have just converted me. I will be back there is just so much more to try!
