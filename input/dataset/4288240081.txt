Grabbed lunch with my husband during a 3 hour layover at the McCarran Airport.  I had a salad and a slice of pepperoni and black olive pizza.  My husband had the pepperoni stromboli and the spaghetti.  We both ordered them as combos, so a soda was included.  Cost was about $10 per combo.  Portion sizes are large, but I think my husband nailed it when he compared the quality of the food to elementary school cafeteria food.  Somehow I remember Sbarro's I've eaten at before to have better food, but not this one.  It is airport food, but I would try someplace else if I had to eat at this airport again.
