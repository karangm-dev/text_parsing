Reading reviews still decided to give them a chance. Stay away 0 customer service. The car I chose and prepaid was not available. Had to wait for vehicle, was not what I expected, car was substandard. Also made the mistake of not checking the fuel tank. It was not full. Tried to reach them immediately after leaving rental place regarding fuel issue. Unable to communicate with anyone at both telephone numbers listed. Snapped a picture of the fuel tank and mileage. Upon returning car explain problem with fuel. Zero acknowledgement. They ended up charging  an additional $30. Pay the extra money go with the reliable rental company. The other problem is they are located off-off site, resulting into shuttle buses.
