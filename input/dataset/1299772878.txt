Cute little dessert shop! Most to their treats consists of liquid nitrogen and is an interesting experience. I tried the dragons breath with my boyfriend and we had fun eating it and blowing out the liquid nitrogen smoke like a dragon.. who says you can't play with food ?? The dragon breath was basically a cup of cheetos thrown in liquid nitrogen and they give you sticks to poke and eat it. We also got chocolate icecream and strawberry cheesecake ice cream. The cup had liquid nitrogen at the bottom with ice cream at the top. I chocolate was creamy and so was the strawberry. The overall atmosphere was cute in a sense since it had a floral wall decor and hanging chairs which make for good Instagram pictures. Speaking of Instagram, they also have a pool of  ballpit balls in the back where u can take pictures. Overall, the deseerts at this place are simple and unique and I'd go again.
