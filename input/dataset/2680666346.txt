Just moved to a new apartment last weekend, and Skinny Wimp Moving made it about as painless as it could be. The three Skinny Wimp movers, Noah, Allen and Mark, did a great job. These guys are not skinny and not wimps - they hustled the whole time and were efficient and courteous. Highly recommended.
