I went with the positive reviews from here and I'm glad that I did.My mother is visiting from San Diego and both she and I were impressed (and that's difficult in south Scottsdale because we're both fans of fresh, authentic, spicy, flavorful fare).Great tom kai kai, pad thai and shrimp with black bean sauce.  I don't eat pork so I didn't try the raved-about eggrolls, but we did partake in the 'regular' eggrolls which were cripsy, tasty, if average.  We splurged and had the home made coconut ice cream and fried bananas (drizzled with honey and sprinkled with chopped peanuts).  Worth it.  Delicious.A delightful experience, the owner(s) both asked if we were enjoying ourselves, warm, excellent service, comfortable booths and thoughtful dining ambiance (once inside).Try it once and you'll find your newest favorite restaurant for an asian food hankering.
