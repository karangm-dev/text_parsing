Honest review: Made an appointment at 12:30 was waiting for an hour and nothing, 2 people came in after me and was seen, bot to mention after every haircut they each took a 10 min smoke break, as i was walking out (without a haircut) they yelled, next time make an appointment bro..... Dont go here unless you're a regular customer
