All the Cirque du Soleil shows continues to amaze me.  I have lost count of how many Cirque du Soleil shows I have seen, but the Beatles Love show added an element that all of their other shows don't have.....the ability to sing to their songs in English.  WOW.....what an amazing show!!  So many elements of the show are amazing and I am sure I missed it.  But I assure you will not leave disappointed.  The sights and sounds of the Beatles was at it's absolute best in this show!  On my drive home, I wanted to take out the Beatles albums and sing to them all the way home.  (I am a BIG Beatles fan!)Good Job Cirque du Soleil for creating quality shows that is worth every penny!FYI..... I also hear that Cirque du Soleil are getting new set of  performers for the Beatles Love show in June 2008 and changing it up a little bit.  Other notes for fans of Cirque du Soleil, they are creating a Criss Angel show at Luxor and an Elvis based show at the MGM.
