This is my family's go-to place for buffet dining, we especially enjoy the lunch for the dim sum. The diners are always racing for the pork shumai and egg tarts, which are popular. We've been regulars for years and commend the restaurant for the food quality and great service. My daughter always looks forward to getting a lollipop (or 2) from the friendly staff.
