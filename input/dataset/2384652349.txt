The only problems that I ever have with Walmart is during the summer. While the store is clean and organized, the outside space is the problem. When it gets hot, I feel like they do not want to go outside and empty the trash and organize the shopping carts. I know it is hot, but they still should take care of the parking lot. Can you believe their was an isle that had so many carts in it, people could not drive down it. I looked a car that had 7 carts leaning on it. I had to go inside and tell them to move the shopping carts because it is getting bad. They did it and when I came back the next day, they were all over the place again. So my tip to you is PARK IN THE BACK AWAY FROM THE SHOPPING CARTS!!!!!
