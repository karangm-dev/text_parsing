Al is a thief. Most mechanics charge a diagnostic fee so if you don't like the quote you can pay the 100 dollars and go somewhere else. Took a 500 deposit without looking at the car. Then he kept the car for 4 days when he said he would look at it that day. Then he up charged 800 more. We paid him and the clutch which was the problem was never fixed. Don't us this guy!  If you need a mechanic please don't use Al.
