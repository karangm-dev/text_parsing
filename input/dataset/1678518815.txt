Appalling customer service. Today, the 2 so-called sales people were extremely rude. After waiting for them to acknowledge us, we finally interrupted their conversation. They laughed and said oh, we're having a discussion. Really?  I thought you were minding the store. I've bought shoes there before and would have bought again today. Will not support a place that allows customers to be treated this way.
