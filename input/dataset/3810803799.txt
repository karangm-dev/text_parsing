Tried to buy a dozen plane bagels, they had about 18 and would only sell us 5... how 5... said they would be sold out too quickly if she sold us 12... So, rather than sell us 24 bagels we purchased ZERO... now she may not be smart enough to understand that 24 bagels at 1:40 in the afternoon must be a pretty large sale but hope that someone reading this will think it would have been... even if it's not a big sale a guaranteed sale of 24 has to be better than a MAYBE sale of the 18 they had???
