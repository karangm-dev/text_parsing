I have been there for 5 different tattoos now and could not be happier with the work done. My artist has been Eric R. and he has always done an incredible job. His attention to detail is second to none. I have recommended to friends who have been incredibly pleased with the work done. All the artists there are friendly and make the experience that much better. 5 stars and then some. Highly recommend to anyone!
