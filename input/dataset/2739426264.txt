Horrible language barrier here. Ordered P4 and it came with Tripe (ewwwwww!!) called the server over and he said the English menu doesn't specify it but supposedly the Viet version does????? How the hell does that make sense?!? He couldn't even explain to me because his English was terrible. I have a shrimp allergy and from that point didn't want to eat any of the other dishes we ordered because how the hell do i know if there's shrimpIn it or not because that menu is unreliable from that point. Egg rolls are whackkkkkk! Seems like super generic frozen brand...Don't eat here. Only came here since they opened early. Searching Yelp now for another pho house because I'm starving!!!
