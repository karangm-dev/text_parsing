I usually really enjoy this club... however I was disappointed last night with my visit. When security was checking my ID the man stared at my chest and asked if the shirt under my jacket was see through and I told him no. He continued to stare at my chest and smirked then asked to see. I felt so awkward and uncomfortable to reveal myself to a man like that.... I felt he should have involved a female if he couldn't take my word that I wasn't wearing a mesh top. I am a classy woman who complies with dress code. This was extremely unprofessional. I then complained to a woman who takes your Guestlist ticket and basically just said sorry and that he can do that .... wow.
