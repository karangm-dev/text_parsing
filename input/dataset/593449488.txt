Nothing to get excited about. The food was a bit over priced, chicken was dry with the meat it's self being tasteless, the breading and seasons were not very good to begin with and over cooked on top of that (I think only seasoned with paprika). I ordered the bacon cheese French fries. I had a few but ultimately wished I had just not ordered them. What is sad is that we saw this place on the directory and were pretty excited to have some good fried chicken. We walked a way wishing that we had eaten ANYWHERE ELSE. like 7- Eleven for a hot dog now sounds better to me.
