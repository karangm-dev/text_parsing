This is for the eastern location. I love the one on Tropicana but the eastern one is terrible. It is a mess of a line and the service is awful! They advertised a special of buy 2 tacos get one free. Not only did they fail to honor there deal but than they messed up on my order. Go to the one on Tropicana the food and service is top notch and they treat the customer right. The one on eastern feels like a different restaurant entirely and not in a good. way.
