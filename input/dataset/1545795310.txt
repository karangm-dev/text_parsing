I met the stylist Robert when he started coming to my work for food and drink with friends. After a few visits I found out what he did and he told me to stop by for a cut. I was growing out my hair and was in need, so I eventually did. I needed something that was more modern but not too flash. When I sat and we began to talk it out I knew I was in excellent hands.  He did an amazing job and it turned out exactly like I wanted and paired my new look with a better product that I'll have to pick up more. Search him out!!!
