As you walk in this place it seems awesome...It's underground! Walking down the stairwell was fun! (minus the heat-felt like youre walking into an oven) The server was awesome. She knew her job well. She does crack your crab legs for you- that was cool.Other than that, the food quality was poor. This was extremely overpriced for the quality! We were in a  party of six and all of us had to  agree we were all upset about the blan food. Im not a huge salt fan- I had to put salt on my food about 4 times to give it flavor. I do not think an expensive menu makes for good food.
