Have been eating here since it was a hole in the wall next to the old Copenhagen store on shea in the 80's.  It went through several locations and finally got new owners and another  location.  You couldn't find nicer owners than Ruth & Shelley.  They go out of their way to make sure you're happy with your food.  You cant get a better roast beef sandwich anywhere!  Their Bialys are the best!  If you're having a party get their bialy stick sandwich tray.  You can custom order it the way you want with the side dishes to go with it.  YUM!  I finally won my husband over with their burgers, which I would never order, when I can get their small roast beef sandwich on a wheat bialy stick.  He also loves their hopple popple for breakfast.  Also I can take my doggies when the weather's nice and sit on their patio and eat
