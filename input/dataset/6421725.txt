Went here for lunch for the first time, had a great lunch special for under $9. Food was delicious, chicken skewer was moist and flavorful, sides were good too. Don't let the small inconspicuous entry deter you from trying this place. Lunch special came with a drink and pitas. I'll definitely be back again.
