I have never thought that a place could fall so far.  Let me start off by stating that I used to love dining at Mitchell's. Now I doubt I will ever walk in again.  I took my wife to dinner here since she has been craving scallops. I am always up for fresh seafood. I always expect to pay a premium but the quality usually offsets the price.  Well not anymore.  The $27 for six small scallops (quarter sized) which were halved and skewered for some reason (too small to flip and the attempt to look like a larger portion epic fall l). Taste was good size ridiculously small for the price.  My entree was the fish shrimp and chips.  Normally I get everything broiled. This time I went with the fried. Well. The fish. 4 small strips of cod. Was oily/greasy. The grease dominated everything. I couldn't even bare to eat more than 1 shrimp.  They were soaked in grease and were mushy.   Service was below average.  When the Waitress asked how the food was I told her it was of by no means good. The amount of grease and the lack of flavor. Her reply sorry and ran away.  Never. Had a manager stop by just dropped the check and ran. My advice go somewhere else.  Once a favorite now avoid at all costs.  Poor service, poor quality, just plain disgusting.
