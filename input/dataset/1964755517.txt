Took my son down for a new bike. The customer service is out of this world.  Gentleman knew anything and everything about mechanics of the bike.  First time tune up included in price.  Warranty is outstanding.  Without a doubt would recommend this to a beginner or professional bicyclist.  Can't thank them enough
