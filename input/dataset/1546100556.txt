When I saw a great deal on the internet for a room at the Venetian, I pounced on it!  I had heard so many great things about this all-suite hotel that I just had to stay there.  This place is huge, one of the largest resort/casinos in Vegas. It is themed so nicely. The shopping plaza with the canals is so charming. With all the shops & restaurants in this hotel you have no reason to ever step outside. ;)Our room was extrordinary. The bathroom alone is bigger than most NYC hotel rooms. There is a glassed in shower, a large soaking tub, double sinks, a vanity table and a seperate water closet with its own phone. The room had 2 TVs, one in the bed area and one in the seating area which was a couple of steps below the sleeping area. I highly recommend a stay at The Venetian!
