Very bummed out about the quality of the furniture made by this company. When you walk in they make such a big point to tell you how well the products are made with such high quality materials. Yeah Right! My husband and I bought a bed 3 months ago. It is now falling apart because of the cheap way it was made. I also bought 2 leather reclining sofas. I was planning on remodeling our whole house with Living Spaces. Not anymore
