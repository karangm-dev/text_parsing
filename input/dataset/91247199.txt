Came here for a quick bite to eat before a movie and usually love Hero burgers but was throughly disappointed in the service. My husband and I decided to order their speciality items other than their burgers, what a wrong choice. I ordered the cranberry turkey burger and my husband ordered their speciality chicken burger. I decided to try their black bamboo bun which you need to pay extra for and the cashier raved it was so different and tasted so good from their normal sesame bun. When we got our meals, I discovered the cashier had inputted my meal wrong and had give me a regular turkey burger with no toppings and just the black bamboo bun. Not really wanting to wait or pay extra, I took some toppings from my husband's burger and chowed it down. Definitely not worth the price. Next time, just stick with their regular signature beef burgers here and don't go with their other speciality options, you will be disappointed. One thing though I did appreciate is at least I saved on less added calories with having the plain burger option (but not my choice!)
