First time eating at this location. My mom and I ordered the chicken and waffle and food came in 5 min. We had a bad feeling because it usually takes about 20min for chicken and waffle when we order it at the Linq or Sahara. When we took a couple of bites we knew the food was NOT fresh. The food was cold, the chicken was saggy and soaked in oil. I asked the server if the food was fresh and of course he said yes. Never coming back again.
