This was a fall back place for my workplace crew. Recent changes to the menu, dumbed down in choice and also in flavour. My favourite lemongrass, spicy Thai soup is now a flavourless assembly of ingredients. Spoonful of chicken or tofu, mushrooms, sprouts-check. Sprig of coriander-check, cup of noodles-check. Delicious lemongrass broth, sorely missing. Big change, amazing how you can just sense the change of quality in the change of decor.Not sure why, new ownership maybe? I'm curious because The Loving Hut which is at essentially the same address has also changed - for the worse. I'm going to have to find out if one owner took over both places, they are franchises after all. Super disappointed.
