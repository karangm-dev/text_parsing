The worst food on our trip to Montreal.THE FOODThe crust is a thick mattress of dough. The veggie pizza was insipid, but the met pizzza was not too bad.THE SERVICECareful!!! They do not cut their pizza all the way through. She said that was intentional, since they don't want the juices the drain thru. But how do you expect us to eat the damn thing! She was a bit huffy about it too...as if isnt that what everyone does. Newsflash lady - no one does.
