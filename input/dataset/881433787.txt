Hands down, the BEST Chinese restaurant on the west side. Not only are they excellent for take-out, but they also have a large sit down part and bar! I normally get the the Sezwhuan chicken with white rice and Spring Rolls (BEST MEAL EVER). I have also tried other numerous items i highly recommend... Chicken Fired Rice, Orange Chicken, Sesame Chicken, Chicken and Broccoli, Won Ton Soup and Hot and Sour, the ribs and the Egg Rolls are the BEST in CLE. If you do have time, I highly recommend having a sit down dinner there, not only do you get way more food, but the service and ambiance is exceptional!
