I really like the new studio. I have been going to this studio on and off (due to money and time issues) since 2009 when the studio was under a different owner and in a different location. I've also been to studios near my hometown in Massachusetts that I didn't like nearly as much because the teacher barked orders into a microphone and said that every posture should hurt. The new location is excellent and the studio is much nicer with the hard wood floors than the old carpet. They also clean the yoga room after each class which I appreciate. I do miss some of the older teachers but the newer ones are still good.The teachers here are very helpful when you ask them a question. I love that Shannon or Zeb will stop the class to show the correct way to do a posture. I also love that all of the teachers will point out people when people are doing well. I know when I hear my name it gives me a boost of confidence and I try harder to do the postures the correct way. I will say I was surprised the one time I rejoined and they recommended no water during class but I have since learned that class really does go better without it. I'm not going to lie, this yoga is pricey but ALL Bikram yoga studios charge the same, if not more, for tuition. Also, if you have issues taking your shoes off and walking around or seeing nearly naked people in class and naked people in the dressing rooms, this probably isn't for you.
