I had a nice size crunch in my bumper and had it fixed @ Bumpermedic.  I could not be happier. They did an incredible job from start to finish. I dropped the car off @ 9 a.m. and had it back by mid-afternoon. No way anyone could tell that there was ever damage done to the bumper. They matched the paint perfectly. It looks like they just put a new factory bumper on the car .. :)Their pricing was very fair. They were friendly and courteous.I highly recommend this place!Thanks guys!
