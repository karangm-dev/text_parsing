The food and prices are great, but the service is horrendous and consistently so. We've gone here many times and the service is always bad. You get seated right away, but are out of luck if you need to ever need something. The waiters and waitresses constantly walk by, but they won't make eye contact. I ordered some sushi rolls off the menu and never received them. It took 45 minutes after asking several waitresses. The waitress brought out more than I ordered and said I wouldn't have to pay for it. When we got the bill she had charged us for the rolls I never asked for. We even asked several waitresses about the rolls and everyone seemed to have forgotten about them. After terrible, neglectful service every time we finally are giving up on going here ever again.
