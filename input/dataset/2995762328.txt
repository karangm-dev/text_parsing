I had been pushing weights around for the past 20 years and was looking for something different and more interesting than doing the same old workout at the gym and man did I find it here!   I thought I was in good shape but I was dead wrong.  I can't tell you how great EVERY instructor is here and how each class is different than the last.   My favorite thing about working out here is that I am learning something at the same time I am getting in the best shape of my life.  It's been 2 years already and hopefully I will be getting my brown belt in a month and then my black belt in February.   I consider the people at Chandler MMA my good friends, stop looking around, stop in and see Master McGowen, he will let you try it free for a week !  Trust me on this one it is truly is awesome.
