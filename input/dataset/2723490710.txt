I first learned about Lynette after commenting on how beautiful my friends skin was looking! She told me she had been going to Lynette for IPL treatments and how wonderful she was. I had experienced a lazer experience previously somewhere else that was not so great but I decided to give Laser528 and Lynette a try because she came so highly recommended and I could see for myself what great work she was doing with my friends skin. I'm so happy I did!!! Lynette is the BEST and so much fun too!!! I will be back every month for my skin care. She offers a lot of other treatments as well and the dermaplaning was amazing also her prices are super amazing too! She really makes these treatments affordable and her products are awesome too!  I just can't recommend Laser 528 and Lynette high enough! I can't wait for my next treatment!!!! Yay!!!
