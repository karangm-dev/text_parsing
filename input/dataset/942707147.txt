Ok.. I agree, the consolidated facilities are great.  Pollution is decreased since not every rental company has to run a bus for their specific passengers.  The offsite baggage check and checkin kiosks are great to have.  So whats the beef??  Could the airport authority and/or Clark County have found a plot of land any closer to the airport??  I mean really... you board a bus to take a drive into the desert of Nevada to pick up your rental?  Upon return, allow 30 minutes to get back to the airport terminal.  One thing Las Vegas is all about is working on too many road projects and falling behind in them.  The airport area is not immuned to this policy.It appears that facility is there to stay so my next suggestion is to have some sort of light rail (like at SFO) that will connect the airport terminal with the car rental facility.  Hopeless in asking...
