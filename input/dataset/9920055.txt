Gluten free or not the food is great. I had the chicken an waffles and the chicken is very tender and the coating very good. I tried the green chili pork tacos. I'm not sure I would order them again, but had good flavor. I also had chunky monkey coffee, I was unsure at first but it was good. Our waiter Conor was very nice and made sure we were taken care of, way above average service. Next time I will get a massive plate of the chicken.
