Was given an offer for employment, took 3 months for the manager to get back and decided to hire me with only 3 weeks left before going back to school. Told the manager that I would be attending school in a matter of weeks so the resignation form would be submitted after working for only 1 week and she said that she was fine, but after turning in my resignation form, tried to chew me out and claimed that she never was told about my schedule and terminated me on the spot.
