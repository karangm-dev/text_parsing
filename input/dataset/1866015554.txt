First review on Yelp and first time at wing time and let me tell you it's soooo good! We got a 40 piece party pack which was good for 4 of us to share and all the flavored were great! The Taste of Asia had a pho essence and my favorite Lemon Pepper was also so good we also got Garlic Parmesan, Hot and mild as well and they were also tasty. The Texas toast was also buttery goodness and the fries were crispy and salted just right. We will definitely be back here soon!!!
