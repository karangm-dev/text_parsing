My mom brought my aunt here for a pedicure straight from the hospital.  They were very rude with her and told her not to come back because it was a beauty salon, basically implying my elderly aunt would scare the customers away.  My aunt is a proud lady and doesn't like asking for help.  She has lived in a 2 block radius for 20 somewhat years and now much to our dismay as she is getting on in years is still extremely proud and still doesn't like asking for help but she needed a pedicure.  I think the people that run this beauty salon need to have a little more respect for the elderly, they were rude, over charged her then told her not to come back...  Please learn some customer service, how about next time politely decline giving the service and allow an older woman some dignity WOW
