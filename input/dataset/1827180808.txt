We'll start with the pros. The meat here is very delicious: soft, moist and flavorful. The condiments bar has some yummy and unique (pickled onions, anyone?) things. The portions are generous (except for the guac, which is the tiniest dollop). And taco Tuesday is cheap- thumbs up there!Then the cons. The place smells really weird and gross (I guess it's the burning charcoal of the grill, but it's so bad I can't stand to eat inside here; not good when it's 118 degrees out). And they don't have a salad option, which is very disappointing. Only tacos, quesadillas, or bowls. All in all, a decent place to grab a quick bite... and sit outside to eat it.
