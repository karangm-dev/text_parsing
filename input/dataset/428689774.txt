Have ate breakfast here and "dinner" once.First of all there is nothing "special" about the specials on the breakfast menu. No special prices or anything. The specials are on the everyday menu. Not happy with cost for the quality of the food. Suspect breakfast potatoes were from a freezer or cooked, frozen, and reheated. Eggs were good, but most people can cook an egg.The time I went for dinner was between 7-8 pm during a weekday. The cook had just turned off the grill, so no burgers or hot cooked stuff. I ended up having a tuna sandwich on the smallest wheat bread ever, tomato and lettuce. And a VIP of reheated tomato soup. Totally underwhelmed and paid over $12 for this meal. Poor quality, little quantity food.  Way over priced for the area. Really had high hopes for this place. They need to make changes or good bye.
