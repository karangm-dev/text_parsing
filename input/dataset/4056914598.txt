Called today after going to yelp to find a good pest company i can trust and the House Dr had great views so i gave them a call. I thought i might have a termite problem but after a few questions from Dave he figured it wasnt termites i have but crickets! Dave even walked me through google pics to ensure what i saw. He also gave me a great price and worked with my schedule to get an appt set for next week. If i go w the other reviews i pretty sure the service will be great too! If not i will repost but doubt i will have too. Give them a call if you need a pest co.
