Horrible customer service! Checkin is a joke! It is very unorganized and chaotic . I went in because my iphone 7 had no service so they swapped out my brand new phone for a refurbished one. Well, the refurbished one had glitching issues. They would not give me a new phone and they said that it was my fault the screen was glitching. Buyer beware......check the model and serial number on any replacement phones you get especially if you have a new phone. If its new, the model number will begin with M. If its used, it will begin with N.
