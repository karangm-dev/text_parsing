My Fiancée took her car here for its annual inspection and they said that both front brakes needed to be changed and that the tie rod end had some play and needed to be replaced as well. I talked to the mechanic and he confirmed that both sets of front brakes were below 2/32nds of an inch and we needed new ones. I took the car and replaced both the front brakes and rotors. All four front break pads had more than 5/32nds left. More than enough to pass inspection. Took it to my mechanic and he said the tie rod end was fine. (My fiancée had both tie rods replaced just last year...) We had the car reinspected elsewhere and it passed everything.I'm really disappointed in the service here. If they'd said 'We recommend you change these things (especially the brakes), but we can pass your car.' that would be one thing. However, they directly lied to me and wanted to charge more than $500 for stuff that wasn't necessary. I don't plan to go back.
