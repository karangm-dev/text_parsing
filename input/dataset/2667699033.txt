My daughter has been asking to go to a revolving sushi place for a year. Little did I know there was one so close to our new home! The food was great, drink refills were very timely, and it was a relaxed, low key environment perfect for her. She actually tried new rolls which is huge. We will for sure be returning. The prices were amazing, very reasonable, and we left completely satisfied for under $30!
