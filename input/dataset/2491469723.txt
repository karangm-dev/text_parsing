Where can I even begin?  We were here during Memorial Day weekend with a party of 20.  Everywhere we went was packed and the wait was long so we settled on having a quick bite at Bar Louie.  HUUUUUGE mistake!  When we walked in we seated ourselves. There were not many people there. The place was an oven.  We waited to order our drinks and those took forever to come out.  Beer was fine, but all of the sodas were watered down.  The waitress said the heat might have melted the ice too quickly and replaced them.  Less ice and the sodas were still watered down.  We placed our food orders.  Half hour later she came back and told someone in our party they were out of nachos for their appetizer.  I went to the restroom  and found the most disgusting toilets.  Rings around the toilet and black crud in 3 of the 4 stalls.  There were holes in the wall and paper everywhere.  When I got back to the table (about 45 minutes after arriving) our food was still not out.  Finally an hour after arriving our food starts to come out.  Half of our party finished eating and the other half still did not have food.  Waitress never came back to bring more beer (in a bar!!).  Three people in our party ordered a Crispy Chicken Melt and the chicken was overcooked on the outside and still FROZEN on the inside.  SERIOUSLY?!?!?!  Several other dishes were brought out cold.  I do not think I have ever had such a bad experience eating out.  To top it off we were billed for the frozen chicken sandwiches.  We spoke to a manager who removed the charges and wound up closing down the kitchen for the night.  Spare yourself, do not go to Bar Louie.
