I had a week trial here. While the facility is ok (enjoyed the sauna & loved the spin class) sales tactics are weird.Before the trial, i made the horrible mistake of giving these guys my phone number...... Don't do that foreal. They will call you 5 times a day and ask when you're coming in for the trial.The week I gave them my number was a busy week for me. I had a lot going on and in the middle of that, my best friend from high school suddenly passed away. The guy wouldn't stop calling, texting and leaving voicemails. Finally I answered and he asked when I was coming in. I mentioned I had a rough week because my friend passed away and her viewing was that night. He said that he was sorry for my loss then literally said "well viewings are usually from 5-7. Could you come down at 8 to view the place and start your free trial?"Absolutely disgusting. I can't make this up for real.Never give these people your number. They walk up and down E Carson asking people to sign up for free trial and they ask for your number. Seriously don't give it to them. They'll call you once an hour every day until 9pm.Even if the gym was phenomenal (it's not), the shitty sales tactic is horrible. I live a block from this gym. The week free trial was cool but after that I never thought of becoming a member. Enrollment fee Prices are extremely high and if they're offering "free enrollment!", they give you a higher  monthly bill to make up for it. This information came straight out of the sales guys mouth when I asked about waiting until free enrollment during my week trialby the way- pictures are deceiving and pure false advertising. there is no pool, no volleyball court and no basketball court. the only thing this gym has to offer is a a 2 story work out area, classes  and a sauna
