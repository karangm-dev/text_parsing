Damn, I wish I had checked Yelp reviews first before ordering via Foodora. Our $50 (+ Foodora cost, tip etc. more than $60) platter for 3 (!!!!) people came a) with a spilled dipping sauce (I am guessing Tahini) and b) without the Fatoush salad which is one of the major menu items and the only green / lettuce part of that platter. Again, on Foodora, this platter says it feeds 3 people. However, there were only 1 or 2 items of each. Only 1 beef skewer, only 2 falafels. But thankfully 3 breads and rice. A major rip-off. Do yourselves a favor. Order anywhere else but here!
