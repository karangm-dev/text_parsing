This place is totally a joke. It's the worst Korean restaurant I have been to. It took 10 minutes to get a drink and 30+ minutes to get your food served. We went there on a Friday night and there was only one server!! The environment is bad and the smoke is everywhere. It's our first time and also the last time to dine here.
