My goal was to introduce my NY friends to a new Chinese restaurant and to show them how a good Yelp rating would lead us to a good dining experience, even though I did not know the area. Strike one and two! Three different dishes and three thumbs down. I am not a dining snob, nor are my NY friends, but the food was a complete disappointment. If bland food were the hallmark of Chinese cuisine, then this would be deserving of the 4+ star rating that attracted me to this small family restaurant. The hostess/waitress was welcoming, but I should have known that that food may not meet our expectations when the waitress informed me that they do not have chinese mustard, only a sweet and sour sauce. One friend ordered the orange chicken and left 3/4 untouched. I ordered the shrimp fried rice which was dry, tasteless and the shrimp was overcooked. The third peson in our party ordered stir fried vegetables and left half. My friends were kind enough not to say anything until I let be known how disappointed I was with the meal and then they chimed in with their similar feelings. Not being familiar with Yelp they also added, "do you use this Yelp thing much?" I do and will continue to do so, but with a little less confidence. The two stars were for the friendly, welcoming service, and pleasant family atmosphere, but I felt compelled to share our less than ideal dining experience so that others may not be mislead and think their experience will always be as others have raved about. To be fair, it may have been an off night, but clearly our experience was not up to the rating and reviews I had read before going there and unfortunately I will not give them a second chance as there are many other establishments that have proved to meet the expectations that their respective reviews have engendered.
