I mean... It's good for what it is.  Good in the fact that it's probably about the only place in Station Square you can chill out with friends and enjoy the waterfront for a bit.  That is, if you're willing to shell out $5-10 to park.  I guess what I'm saying is... Station Square needs some help and Bar Louie kinda fits in with the whole chain-restaurant-tourist-trap appeal.  Do they have good happy hour specials?  Yes.  Is it quality?  Not really.  Does it do the job?  Yes.  Super sweet weak drinks and mediocre food.  Check.  If you're a tourst, check out all the fantastic local restaurants we have and skip this joint!
