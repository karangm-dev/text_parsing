Ridiculous. The nurses and doctor seemed more interested in bickering than helping my kid. We waited in the waiting room, waited in the examination room, and then waited some more. After all that, they have hounded me for three months because the claim has been rejected repeatedly by insurance, and I have repeatedly provided them with the correct insurance information. Then, yesterday, their own representative told me they had been billing it as a dental claim instead of a medical claim. Add to this the surly nature of the "customer service" people who have been calling me each month, and this is a place we'll never visit again. I'm avoiding Dignity like the plague from now on.
