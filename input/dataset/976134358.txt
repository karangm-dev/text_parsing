This location used to be fantastic. I'd been coming here for 5+ years, spending thousands over the life of my car. The guys were honest, efficient, friendly, fast, and I always left feeling safe and confident and not taken advantage of.Over the last 6-12 months I've seen that longtime staff disappear and the location be populated with folks that don't seem to know what they're doing when it comes to cars OR customers.Confusion at checkin, non-mechanic "associates" that can't interact with customers with any degree of skill.But, let's focus on the quality of work- I used to come here because they were honest. They would always do a complete check then run down a list of what they found and let me choose based on their advice. Now- no more. Those guys are gone and I wish I knew what shop they were working in because I'd drive pretty far to get to do business with them again.The prices are outrageous compared to what they used to be. And the quality of work is terrible. I took my car in there last week for what they called a "fuel leak" and now after filling my car with gas it's stalling out and I'm scared to even drive it. I am reading through the experiences of others over the last year and that's exactly what I have experienced- shoddy workmanship and lack of attention to detail along with extremely inflated prices for "labor". I wouldn't mind paying more if I knew the work was getting done properly.
