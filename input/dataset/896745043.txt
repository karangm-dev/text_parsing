I couldn't be happier with North Scottsdale Peds! They are a busy office but always find time to get my 6 month old baby in. Waiting rooms and exam rooms are comfortable and clean. Love that they have a sick and well waiting room. Their afterhours triage has been invaluable - at 10 days old Jude was really sick one night the triage nurse urged me to go the ER (even though everyone else thought I was a new mom who was overreacting). My son had to have emergency surgery the next day. The surgeon applauded NSPs for recognizing the red flags after hours and urging us to go in. Thank you for your care Dr. Cesal and team!
