Made the mistake of eating here twice. Once, because I thought it would be good based on what others had told me, and once because someone else insisted we go. (They were sure it would be a much better experience my second time around.)Here's a tip for the owner/manager:Hire wait staff whose first language is ENGLISH or who speak it FLUENTLYHire wait staff who are friendly and efficientHire wait staff who act like they really care if I returnHire wait staff who really want me to tip themTAKE CREDIT/DEBIT CARDS; This is 2012, nearly 2013. The IRS must love you because you don't pay taxes on what you actually make. (Cash only means you only report what you want to, not what you actually rake in. How clever)The bacon, the pancakes, and fresh squeezed orange juice were great. The negatives above don't make it worth the extensive wait for a table. This place is over priced, doesn't take plastic, and the wait staff need a huge improvement. I'll take IHOP any day of the week over this silly place. You do remember you're in Scottsdale, right?
