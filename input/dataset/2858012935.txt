Margaret did my wedding dress alterations (and my husband's suit alterations) in 2012. She was friendly and prompt even though she was also making her own wedding dress at the time! My favorite thing in addition to the perfect alterations is that she surprised me with a custom shawl made out of the remnant fabric of my dress that I wanted removed. Everyone loved it (and so did I), and it was a perfect addition to my dress for our October wedding.
