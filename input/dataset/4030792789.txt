I just moved to Phoenix area from So-Cal and needed to find a dentist that I was comfortable with. Dr. Patel is very personable and the staff very friendly and caring.The office manager Karen was really great at working with me and making me feel like I had been coming to this office for years!What a great place to take your family!I highly recommend this to anyone in town or from out of town looking for the kindest top notch dentistry in the Phoenix area!
