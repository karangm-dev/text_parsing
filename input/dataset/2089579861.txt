I've gotten my windshield replaced from this company before and didn't have any problems, until this last time. I got a call from the same girl who I spoke to the previous time I had it replaced and was promised $50 cash bonus. We set up the install, and after the glass was installed I asked the replacer for the money. He said they don't carry cash and I had to get it from corporate. I called numerous times trying to get it. The girl I set up the deal with quit because she said this company is screwing people over by promising cash and never giving it out but she told me that they took the cash out of her check. So I call the managers number that was on my statement. I call her and she tells me that she will "look into it and get back to me." I called her after a couple weeks of never hearing from her and she finally answers and tells me she quit for the same reasoning as the sales representative. She gave me a guys number by the name of Gary. I call him and he gives me the same run around about having to look it up and he'll get back to me but also says I was just in time cause that was the last week of the 50 cash promotion. He then tells me that they must of had the wrong address and gets my new one. Even if they had the wrong address, the mail would get forwarded to my new place. After another couple weeks of no check showing up I called him. He finally gives me an answer, telling me that they never took money out of that girls check and that both of those employees are liars. This entire process took 2 months. And I am now having problems with my windshield not being properly sealed and leaking. Note to self, only deal with companies that your car insurance company backs. To sum up this lengthy statement, don't use this company. They seem to not have their shit together.
