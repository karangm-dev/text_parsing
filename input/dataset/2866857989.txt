Finally an authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Richmond Hill. This is the best Viet restaurant in the RH and Markham areas; owned by Vietnamese people.There is a good selection of different things on the menu. Beside the menu items, they have "specials" hand written on the walls. 1) Spring rolls: 2 rolls for $4. Their fish sauce was quite good; not overly salty like some other places. Spring rolls were small but we'll stuffed with meat. 2) Banh cuon (steamed rice rolls, on special menu written on the wall): was on point. This is my fav viet dish and not too many restaurants offer this so I was very excited to find out they do serve that here. The skin was nice and thin and stuffed with minced pork; served with veggies and fish sauce. They come in 2 sizes: small or large. Yum!!!!3) Pho: authentic; broth was so good; I couldn't stop slurping it. Decent amount of noodles and meat. And price was a bit cheaper than other viet restaurants.4) Bun Rieu (tomato based noodle soup): also another item on special menu. Broth tastes home made; I enjoyed it; however, it could use a bit more meat.We ordered four items which was a bit too much food for two people but we wanted to try everything on the menu. Bill came out only about $30. This restaurant is a bit out of my way but definitely will return for more authentic Viet food
