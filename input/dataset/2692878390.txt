I can't figure out why this place doesn't have a 5 star rating.  We came here for the dim sum and left with grins on our faces and food stains on our pants and shirts.  Whenever my husband and I go out to eat, we can always tell a place has wowed us by the amount of food that flies.  The salt and pepper shrimp and the spicy tofu, pork, and shrimp balls were spiced ever so right - both came with generous doses of cilantro and jalepenos.  Quite the combination and they made my taste buds cry out in joy.  The plain shrimp balls and thin noodles were nicely done.  Very nicely - the plate was heaping, and we were each able to get 4 portions out of it.  We also tried the pork and vegetable balls which were heavenly.  I can't forget about the shrimp balls coated with roe - it was as if the sea had walked off the plate into my mouth.  The pot stickers were packed with meat and were so tasty, it was a shame we could only stuff 3 of them into our already full bellies.  And finally, the sesame balls - oh my goodness!  We have eaten at quite a few Asian restaurants, but this one is tops.  The price was just right, and the service was fast and efficient.  Will go back again and again....and again.
