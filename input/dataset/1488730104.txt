DO NOT GO TO THIS STORE!! This store is extremely dishonest and criminal. If I could give them 0 stars I would.Over the last year I have taken my vehicle to them twice. Both times they tried to betray me. The first time (about a year ago), I complained to their district manager and he made an effort to make up for the dishonesty which I appreciated. Today I took my vehicle to them again. My front right tire had a very slow leak so I wanted to get it patched. About a 1/2 hour later an employee named Corey called me and told me the tire was too old and he couldn't repair it. He also told me that both of the front tires needed to be replaced. I told him not to do the work but I would be back to pick up my vehicle as well as a quote for the new tires. When I got to the store, Corey was gone and there was no quote. The person at the counter printed me a quote and I left. When I got home I heard a lot of air coming out of the tire that previously had a slow leak. A little while later I checked the tire and it was COMPLETELY FLAT!!This store is CRIMINAL. I will be filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau as well as the City of Las Vegas.
