BEST place to get a tattoo, hands down. The shop is very clean. The guys that work there are very good at what they do and take a lot of pride in their work.  I live in Texas now, and still fly to Phx twice a year to have Fat Rat tattoo me. You won't be disappointed in your work if you go here!!! Promise!!
