This place is hard work! First you have to look through magazines to find what exists and what you want. Then you  have to order it which is more difficult then it seems, for example if you are ordering a door lock you have to search out the 3 different pieces and codes as it doesn't come in a nice easy display box like at Home Depot. Or if you want to order kitchen cabinets you better know more then their cabinet person or you're in serious trouble and who knows what sort of cupboard system you'll end up with. Payment is only through debit or cheque (need to add extra for shipping and freight with most companies). Finally you may get your product in 6 weeks or maybe not... Would we sign up for this 3 yr commitment again? No. What a hassel!
