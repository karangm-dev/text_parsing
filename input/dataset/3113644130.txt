Location permanently closed. Seems as though Calgary doesn't get many frequent reviews, or someone else local would have spotted this. I would suggest yelp add a place to post notices of businesses being closed, whether permanently or temporarily. Google maps also seems to think this location is still in operation, so maybe this was a recent change.
