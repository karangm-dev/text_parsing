Got a coupon to this buffet from the Tix4Tonight booth.  Not in my top 5 picks for a buffet but went with it because of the coupon, which took 30% off the price.The buffet is divided into stations.Crab legs seem to be the big seller here but other than that, the fish section was weak.The sushi looked dry.Overall the buffet was boring and lame.Not a great selection and while nothing I had tasted bad, it wasn't great either.Beer and wine was unlimited, but they were serving only one type of beer.It was a decent meal on the cheap, but not somewhere I would go again.If you can afford it, go to Caesar's or Wynn.
