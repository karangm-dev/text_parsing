Geek Squad has some issues.   The first time I went there to upgrade my ram, I waited 25 minutes, then the tech helped me to order the ram.  It came 2 weeks later.  Now I know I could have bought the ram on Amazon.com and had it in 3 days.  The second time I went there I had to wait about 30 minutes, I needed a fan changed.  I had already bought the fan (learned my lesson from the first experience), the young man said no problem it would take 2 hours and cost $50.  It was already about 4pm so I said I'll pick it up tomorrow.  Well, next day I find out they couldn't do the job.  I understand it's not the easiest thing in the world to replace, but at the same time, it is very doable.  I'd do it myself if I wasn't so busy.  But they said they couldn't do it because the motherboard bla bla bla.  I know excuses when I hear them.  Are these guys really professionals if they can't swap out a fan?  Looks like a bunch of gamers to me.  They like to "play" with computers but can they actually fix them?I ended up going to Data Doctors (SE corner of FLW & Thompson Peak next to the Water Store) who I now highly recommend.  They swapped out the fan in 2 hours without a single issue.  Yes they do charge more than Geek Squad.  I guess you get what you pay for.  Also, there is no waiting time at Data Doctors.  You walk in and someone is helping you almost immediately.
