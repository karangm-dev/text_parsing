TexasTripletMom's Best Burger in America List - Ranking #6Ladies and Gentlemen, I am a well reputed burger aficionado. I'm a burger snob. Be it greasy spoon or gourmet i'm on a perpetual hunt of the best burger in America. That illusive cheeseburger is my Moby Dick. And BSpot burger -- while it held my #2 burger spot at one point has slipped only to a very reputable #6 position due to fierce competition from the most amazing burgers across America.You must understand, to be top ten worthy -- a burger really must impress. It must cause unmitigated joy - a giant grin - and compulsive participation in what I call "The happy burger dance". More often than not I get to enjoy the BSpot burger at Bar Symon in the Pittsburg airport. However, they do it better in Cleveland. Only the best burgers make the list. BSpot serves a few cache burgers, however what I went for was the all American classic. What I remember about it was simple. Great home-made bun, simple seasoning, perfect balance of flavors, exceptional meat, homemade assortment of pickles. Lard fries (Lola fries) that come in a few different configurations. This burger is juicy and drips all over your fries which makes the combination all that much more endearing.
