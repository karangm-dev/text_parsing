I made reservations for a group of 15 through OpenTable and it was the easiest reservation I made for the trip.  The decor is nice and the location convenient.My food was completely blah.  I had the fried macaroni appetizer which was absolutely tasteless and a side caesar salad which I did not care for.  My fiance and I split the Gummy Bear dry ice cocktail.  It was tasty but half of the goblet was full of ice, which I wasn't expecting for a $36 drink.It was okay, but there are far, far better places to eat/drink on the strip.
