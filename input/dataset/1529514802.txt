Cute restaurant! They have a twigim platter (called the fried platter) here which was my favourite part of tteokbokki as a kid when my grandma made it. Interesting spin on the flavours, something for everyone. If you can't handle heat, don't get spicy. If you think you can handle heat, get spicy. Extra spicy is very spicy, I like it, but no one I've ever went with has been able to eat it.Bingsu is also good! Ice isn't shaved as thin as other places, but flavour and size and toppings are awesome. Service is spectacular, not once did we have to ask for our water to be filled. Were not rushed out after we finished our meal. Free odeng soup because the weather was bad (not pictured)! Greeted upon entry and when we left the staff also said thanks!Great place to go with friends! Highly suggest splitting the twigim if you go with others. Big portions, fairly cheap, always leave full and satisfied (with a charged phone too! They have charging stations, just bring your own cable!)
