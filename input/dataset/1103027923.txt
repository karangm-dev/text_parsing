The decor!! Makes me proud to be inside. The service is nice. It's cool being served by non-Persians who are enthusiastic about the pronunciation and the food items. Khoresht (stew) is the best in the city. The gheymeh tastes like Ashura gheymeh!! The appetizer option of mirza ghasemi is the best I have ever had. Has a smokey taste.
