UPDATE: 9/9/17I cracked a tooth on the afternoon of Labor Day so I left a message on their voice mail asking them to call me to schedule a first available appointment.  Lo and behold, I received a call from Jade at 7 a.m. the next morning for an appointment the following day.  She was so kind and courteous! I was so happy and relieved!  The staff was amazing and Dr. Chow and his assistant Linda were so great that I felt no pain or discomfort throughout the temporary crown procedure.  They are such perfectionists because they took their time to get my crown right and always asked me if I was doing okay. Customer Service is of utmost importance to this office and to me. They are truly top notch! I am so thankful I found them through Yelp and I highly recommend them to anyone. Thank you again, Bella Smiles, for your amazing service and for putting a smile on my face every single time!
