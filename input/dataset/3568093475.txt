they make one heck of a philly!  i've eaten at all the philly places in the valley & this place is the best.  just tried the red sauce for the first time & so glad i did.  it added a teeny touch of heat & the texture made the sandwich that much better.  it takes them a bit of time to make it, but good food takes some time.  if that's a problem, then call ahead & order.   it's that simple.and if you thought good customer service was dead?  well, it's not!  these girls are simply & genuinely the sweetest ever!yum! yum! yum!
