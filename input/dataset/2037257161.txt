i was so frustrated with other cleaning services. they were horrible! by the time i called CSI, i did not expect much. to my surprise , from the moment i spoke to Jasmine to set up appt , i knew this company is the best choice for top quality work. they cleaning techs arrived ON TIME, with tons of their own equipment , and worked swiftly without any complaints. the two ladies (Kelly and Amanda)obviously had many years of experience working with various types of materials and how chemicals react with them. the attention to detail, efficiency of their movements, and the professionalism of their attitudes took me by total surprise. they did not try to shorten my time or over bill me. i work graveyard shift in local ER and i had to sleep while they worked very hard delivering a fabulously cleaned home and a smile too! what would normally take any other service 3-4 hours to complete, due to their superb organizational skills and team work , they finished in 2.5 hours! saved me money and gave my family a clean environment to enjoy! they are my angels!
