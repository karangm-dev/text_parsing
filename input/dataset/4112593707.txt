We arrived in Arizona with the hopes of making it our home. March of 2013As Software Contractors we have down times and rely on Gold and Silver to keep us afloat until the next contract. After a Google Search we found Coin Gallery. I could not believe the excellent service and was stunned at the price paid for Silver Liberties and Gold Jewelry. We visited several times and each time got better. We have bought and sold silver and gold for many years across the USA and the Coin Gallery was the best place ever.With permission from Mike Barry I decided to use the Coin Gallery for my Adobe class project and created this Video: (My First) Note: you may have trouble the first time if the screen goes black REFRESH the browser or if it is SLOW the first time please WATCH VIDEO A SECOND TIME because it is loading into memory.THANKS AND ENJOY!https://vimeo.com/83289913
