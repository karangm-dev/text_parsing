I made a trip up to Cornelius today just to check out this place. When I finally figured out the parking sitch ---in the back (heeeeeeey) I walked up and saw a sign in the window saying they were sold out of cupcakes. Isn't this the main product they offer? If it was closing time I could see this but two hours before they closed? Me no likey. Somewhere along the line in my cupcake adventures, I've  pissed off the cupcake gods.
