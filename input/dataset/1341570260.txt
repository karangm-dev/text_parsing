If I could give no stars I would. HORRIBLE! Absolutely, HORRIBLE! Been a member for almost 5 years and they were so RUDE I was on the verge of cursing the presentation receptionist out. I told them right from the start I didn't want to buy additional credits. They pushed and pushed- my response was still no. They don't like the word NO! The receptionist never made eye contact with me, gave me my deposit back and said "Bye" in the rudest way! I tried to talk with her and find out why everyone was rude. Her response (without looking at me and typing in her computer) "Someone will get fired if you don't sign". I replied "He said he'd get his pink slip if I didn't add credits. But I saw him on my last visit here 3 weeks ago". Without turning around she said "Bye I have no more to say to you".  I mentioned I'm putting a review on Yelp and she agin said bye!I went downstairs and told the nice gentleman what happened and the manage overheard. They were shocked. The manager repeatedly asked if there was anything she could do. I was so mad and refused her offer. I should have asked for show tickets. I said I was so shocked at the attitudes toward an owner and will NEVER refer anyone to WorldMark. I'm calling customer service tomorrow.
