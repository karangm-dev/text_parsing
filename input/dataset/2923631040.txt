I was seen here today by NP Rebecca Gonzales. She is unfriendly, uncaring and unprofessional. I felt like she was annoyed that I was there. She did not bother to hear/listen to me about my illness. She had her mind made up and that was it. I would avoid going to this location again if needed so that I would not have to be seen by her. The rest of the staff was professional and friendly and the facility was clean.
