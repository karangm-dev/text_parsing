I feel this would have been a good visit with great potential; however... it just fell short on many levels. It was a beautiful 30+ sunny day and my dear friend's birthday. We both love the heat and thought, hey why not a rooftop patio that is just out of the stampede craze. So Molly's is where we ended up. All was good at first, I was able to get a half pint of Stiegel Radler and socialize. The next few events kind of sucked though... when our waitress came back to take our food requests we ordered wings to start and then he got a steak sandwich and I asked for the chicken greek salad with the dressing on the side.... About 45 mins gone by and we were delivered our wings and mains at the same time and my salad was like soup in dressing and there was EXTRA dressing on the side.... I was very disappointed.... His steak was also not cooked the way he wanted.Our server came back and asked how is everything, and when I said "well, it's ok...but..." at that,  she just walked away without even letting me finish my sentence. Overall being outside on the roof was nice and there were decent beer choices, however I will never go back.... I like my food too much to pay for something I ate Â¼ of.
