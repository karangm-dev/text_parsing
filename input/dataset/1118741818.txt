Sooo I've been to a few different clubs in Vegas and decided to give this place a shot. Super disappointed and left within an hour. People act like they're special, it's over crowded..no room to walk ... long wait for the bar... no where to sit or even dance it's so crazy I can't believe I'm even writing a bad review I never do this but I'm so disappointed. Clubs at Paris, Cesar's, Bellagio:.. even chillin at the bars around are more legit. Music is rad but nothing else about this place is.
