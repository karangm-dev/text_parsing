Wannabe hipster bar, full of people who wish they could afford to live in Brooklyn. Me and a group of friends tend to go here once a week or so, but we're hoping the new hotels in East Liberty might have better bars when they open. They never stick to their advertized opening hours. If it's summer they may stay open til 2, but past September they make every effort to close as early as they can. Staff are haughty without any reason to be. Super-obvious, badly curated punk on the stereo. It's Pittsburgh, it's about as good as you can expect in this area. Which isn't saying much.
