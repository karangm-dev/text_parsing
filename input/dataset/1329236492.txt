from all the reviews i've read and heard about, i was really underwhelmed by what i got.  the decor reminded me ann arbor's olive garden - nursing home like and homely.  compared to wicked buffet at the cosmo, this place did not look appetizing at all.the food selection wasn't awesome but it wasn't bad, i would say average buffet.  but this probably was because i went during lunch.. 20 bucks per person for lunch so it wasnt bad for the price...the one pro that i did appreciate was the speedy waiter service here.  they were more on top of things than wicked buffet.but when I go back to Vegas, i don't think i'd be visiting bellagio's buffet as first choice...
