I have counted on Terri R. for many, many years for just about every occasion.  If I have a verse that is corny or dopey or just needs an added touch, she is more than ready to help.All of the Birthdays, Holidays, Valentines Days and Wedding Anniversary's, Terri is always there to assist and always delivers on time.Her arrangements are always different and leave me speechless, as does those that receive the flowers.  Absolutely amazing.I would recommend Terri for ALL of your Floral needs.  She is the best, hands down.Thank you Terri and your entire staff for everything.  I will be seeing you again soon.http://www.ambrosiafloralboutique.com/
