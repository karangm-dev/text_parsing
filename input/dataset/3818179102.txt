Kim is the absolute best!  Never met a store owner who made a shopping experience so personal. She cares about her customers and providing them with the most up to date styles and stays trendy. It's a great place for  a mother/daughter shopping day too. Kim is a huge supporter of other local businesses and is also a part of anything where she can help encourage other owners.
