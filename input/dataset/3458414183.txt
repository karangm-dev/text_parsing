I honestly thought that all Winchells had closed down years ago, but found this location on Yelp.  I was told by the owner that this specific store is independently owned while the others in Vegas are part of the Winchells chain.  When I was a kid, my dad used to frequent another Winchells and when I was in junior high, there was a Winchells by the local movie theater and that's where my friends and I would stop for our doughnut fix.  Because my parents were regulars, they always brought back twists, apple fritters, and maple bars - so guess what I bought during this trip?Although, these weren't fresh from the oven (we showed up around 4pm), the donuts were still soft and super tasty.  They weren't overly sweet and perfect with a cup of coffee.  I left myself half of the apple fritter for breakfast the next morning and it was still soft and delicious.  There's something about their dough that I find perfect for my taste buds and the texture is always soft and slightly chewy.  I will always love Winchells and if I ever have kids, best believe that they'll be Winchells lovers too!
