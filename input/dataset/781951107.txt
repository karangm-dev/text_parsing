I am officially a PROUD eggslut. I'm probably the nastiest one around! Lol I have heard so many great things about eggslut so I was ecstatic to know that I was staying at the hotel where it is located. It's inside of The Cosmopolitan on the second floor by The Chandelier. Yes...the line will be long and it wraps around the corner but the line moves quickly. We were waiting less than 10 minutes before we reached the counter and about 5 minutes to get our food. The menu is a decent size but the drinks are limited and pricey. $5 for a bottle of water...but hey, it's Vegas. You're supposed to throw away your money. I had the sausage, egg and cheese and it's amazing! It is greasy but that perfect if you have a hangover! They have chairs and tables to sit at (not many) and the soundtrack is very upbeat. I would eat an eggslut every morning if I could (pun highly intended) lol
