Very expensive for what you get, extremely slow service. I will not be back.. the entire time I was eating my dinner I was thinking about the FIVE GUYS Burgers & Fries across the street.. i had to go to Dairy Queen afterwards because I was still hungry. A big guy like me needs to eat and the pita I got for 7+ dollars was way to small for the price.. no drink or fries included.
