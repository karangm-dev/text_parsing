Maybe I ordered the wrong things but I was thoroughly unimpressed by this place.Tucked in a little corner in First Markham Place is this little Chinese dessert place.  They also have some snack items and rice bowls on the menu but I'd say the majority of the customers are here for desserts. Upon being seating we were given some tea. I noted that the tables had dried "swirl" marks from being wiped down with dirty towels and were still sticky. Ick. The seating is not very comfortable - short Chinese-style stools. I guess they don't want you to be too comfy and stay too long. I ordered the taro and tapioca sweet soup with coconut milk and it was ridiculously sweet and very watery. If I wanted sugar water with baby tapioca in it I could have gone somewhere and ordered a bubble tea! My friends ordered mango pudding (unimpressive, but at least they use fresh fruit) and the steamed milk and egg white custard. The milk & egg white custard was a bit watery as well. Be aware that if the menu states that something will take 20 mins to prepare, it really does so don't get annoyed at the waitresses. There is are washrooms on site (which also double as their utility closet and staff locker rooms) and they accept cash only.If I want Chinese dessert, I'll stick with Sugar in Chinatown.
