I gave this place a couple tries because I was really interested in the concept and the menu options looked awesome. On my last visit there was a lot left to be desired both service and product. The burger was sloppy with very little flavor, fries were Luke warm when I received them, appetizer sampler was mostly pickles and mushroom pieces and the shake was supposed to be flavored with white chocolate and key lime, but it was plain vanilla and milk. Each time I ordered takeout from this location items were prepared incorrectly or forgotten. I love a good cheeseburger, but each time I have ordered from here I have been uninterested after a bit or two. For the price....sit down restaurant prices for oversized meals with undesirable flavor. I did not want to be so critical of this joint because the look and feel of the concept seemed like such a winner, but a drive through value menu at any fast food restaurant would leave me more satisfied and with less regret.
