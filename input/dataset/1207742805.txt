I came in to try on some wigs with a friend who was thinking about cutting her hair short. I was contemplating a new hair color. The lady who works here was rude and short. You can only try on wigs if you purchase a cap for 50 cents, which is fine, but then you can only try on 5 and take no photos. I was about to put on my 5th wig when the lady tells me I have tried on too many and she doesn't want any more stress so I can't try any more on. I told her this was going to be my 5th and she refused to let me try any more on. She sucks.
