I wanted to try this restaurant for a long time. This was a huge mistake. The service was OK and the waiter did a good job selling the plate of the day. Fried sweetbread next to stuffed eggplant with pork sauce. I did not expect having fried blend sweetbread with a mixture of veggies and eggplant (not stuffed) and the pork sauce was ground pork with curry sauce. Nothing incredible. It felt like someone decided to experiment and it failed monumentally. I won't go back and I'm just telling you, don't waste your time or money. It's not worth it.
