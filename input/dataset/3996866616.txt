Me, my girlfriend and brother came here to check out their Trivia Night which we found online and figured it was close so why not. The trivia was fun, we had a great time and the place is honestly pretty cool. It has a cool, laid back kind of vibe, somewhere to go to hangout.I've read a bunch of other reviews here about how great their food is here, so we must have come on a bad night because we didn't get that. We ordered the chicken strips and mozzarella sticks, and both we over-cooked, almost burnt. Also, the beer selection was quite limited to pretty much standard American lagers with a few crafts thrown in. Although the trivia night was fun, I don't think the food was worth it.
