I thought this place was great! I had a wonderful cocktail. The name escapes me- I believe it was strawberry something. Anyway, that wasn't even what blew me away most... the ambience was great, and the vegetable kebobs were incredible! The hummus and pickled cauliflower that comes with it is so good. I could've eaten that all day. The service was impeccable for how busy it was, and the food came out fast. I will definitely be back for more than just happy hour, but I'm happy this place is doing so well. We need more places like this in Pittsburgh.
