The ONLY reason it even gets a two is because staff is normally quite nice. ALWAYS UNDERSTAFFED, ALWAYS TAKES AT LEAST TWO HOURS. The Tempe location is at least 4-5x busier but always fully staffed and way faster. The only reason i stopped going to Tempe location was because there was a huge blood stain on the wall and all they did was blame each other and no one cleaned it the 30 more mins i was giving blood. Never went back....  Almost done coming here too. There is one lady that I think I overheard was the manager of the front one day, and she is ROTTEN. Most staff is usually kind but all are horribly slow.
