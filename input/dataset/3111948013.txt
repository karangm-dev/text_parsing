No words for how bad my experience tonight was from the staff, being a non-regular. I asked for change for a twenty for golden tee, instead bartender gives me tab snatches 20 and cashes me out. So then, I needed more change.10 minutes later, after foolishly tipping her like 40% she... #1: completely ignored me when I attempted to politely grab her attention when she was free.. #2: then on her own asked ME if I closed out my previous tab. Wtf?I ordered one more thing. After a series of more almost surreal rude interactions I will be addressing to ownership, I cashed out on a $8 tab. A random person comes up in my grill, one that showed no obvious signs of being an employee, and questions me if I paid. Btw, again I over tipped giving $2 on the$8. I put in $35 in jukebox, all the songs were bypassed, by people associated with the place. A whole other thing I'll save for ownership...
