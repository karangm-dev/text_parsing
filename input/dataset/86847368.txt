First the guy at the entrance told me I couldn't go to the membership desk without already having a membership card.  Then he decided I could if I went in the exit.  Then the woman at the exit wouldn't let me in because a) it was the exit, b) she was too busy, and c) because I didn't have a membership card.  I went in anyway and she was very upset.  Then the guy at the membership desk couldn't be bothered to acknowledge me while he did heaven knows what.  Finally he told me my online form I was told to fill out online, printout, and bring was not acceptable and that I needed to start over.  His reasoning was that he hadn't been trained in this form so it wasn't acceptable.  I tore it up and left.  He yelled at me as I left, but I ignored him and left.  They must not want me as a customer.
