Many others wrote about decor but I barely notice the trendy sitting area or outdoor seating looking over the treasure island show as I head purposely for the bar stools to order the all time BEST Kobe beef sliders-mini burgers of all time! These are a las vegas must have while i am in town, they are a melt in your mouth, not cheap, perfect sized treat before heading out to a club or other drunken adventure.Another dish I have added to my must have list at Social house is the yellowtail sashimi w/ tempura jalapenos. These are right up with the sliders now, who knew jalapenos and thinly sliced yellowtail could taste THIS GOOD!!
