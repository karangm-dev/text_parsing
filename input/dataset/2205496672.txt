Went there to get a couple bottles of juice since they have good pricing and will not be going back. Walked in the door and nobody acknowledged that we were there. Finally walked up to the counter and the guy waited a few minutes before we got a "can I get you something?" I asked about popular flavors and suggestions for mixing on certain flavors they had and he said " I don't know". So I guess if you know exactly what you need and don't mind waiting ten minutes for help to get out the door it would be the perfect place for juice. Also the shop was not very clean and the bottles looked gross. I will be staying with my normal Vape shops from now on.
