I went in for a tooth cleaning. They told me they had to do some "medically necessary work." Not being a dentist I trusted them. I told them that I absolutely could not pay for it unless insurance covered it. They assured me it did. I had them double check to be sure, again they assured me. I went home and researched what they were going to do. Finding online that it might not be medically necessary I called back to cancel my appointment. Dr. Warren got on the phone and assured me it absolutely had to be done. I went forward with the work. After it was all done, I found out they had not done their due diligence in talking to my insurance--it was not covered. I was able to scrape the money together to pay them. I was upset and paid in all $1 bills. When I went in to pay I was informed I was the third person to pay that way that day (shouldn't that tell you something?). I am seeing a new dentist now who I enjoy much more. He also told me what Dr. Warren told me was incorrect and the procedure was not medically necessary, just an up-sale. Never going back.
