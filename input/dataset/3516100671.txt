They used to have a young guy working there that was pretty good. Now they have some scruffy looking guy that could use about 3 shaves who isn't nice to people and is gruff and unfriendly. It's a really good way to lose business when you don't treat customers with a smile and you act like it's a chore to help them out. I'm not impressed.
