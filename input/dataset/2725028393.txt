I had to rate this business 5 stars, since they came right to my home. Taking all the stress away of my having to drive around on my wedding day. Not to mention I loved the end result, my hair and make up turned out just the way I had envisioned it. They were super friendly and super attentive to detail. They wanted to ensure I was satisfied and even followed up with me a few days later..I will definitely recommend to friends and family.
