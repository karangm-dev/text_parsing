The Venetian is truly a place for a princess! Three flat screens (1 for the main bedroom, 1 for the living room, and 1 for the bathroom) and we definitely utilized all three! And the beds are huge, plush, and there's a chaise lounge in front of each bed. Princess!The Bella Suite was offered at a GREAT price and I didn't realize that the Venetian is one of the few hotels you can stay in and not really need to leave (but you should!). They let us check in early and checked us in really fast.The only thing and I hope this is a rare/isolated incident was when my girl friends and I got into the elevator to go into the lobby. We were on the 11th floor and requested to go down, but for whatever reason it went up and then stopped and the entire elevator cart with only us in it went completely black! I freaked out! It only took a few seconds for light to come back on and for the elevator to go back on the 11th floor and pick up some more guests but we quickly got out and took another elevator cart. Very scary, but luckily everything was okay. Hope they get that checked out.I had a great time staying here and would definitely come back.
