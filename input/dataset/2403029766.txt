Terrible terrible terrible; those who gave 5 stars must have had someone different or wrote their review immediately after they got their phone back. Yes, the phone looks great, they have pretty colors, fix it pretty fast, but that's it. 1) the guy who "fixed" my phone, broke my iphone's camera. I had to take it to uBreakiFix to get a new camera installed which cost ~$60. 2) The receiver dislodged and has fallen into my phone somewhere. 3) When I took it to the new kiosk at Carolina Place, the guy there (much smarter, knew what he was talking about- go there if you must) told me that he couldn't even look at the phone because the back piece had the Apple logo and such on it, and they weren't even authorized to put those on the phones. So wtf did this guy put on my phone? 4) On top of that, he never emailed me my receipt so there's really nothing I can do about any of this. Ever since I took my phone to get "fixed", the functionality of my phone has declined immensely and because I had a 3rd party work on it, my insurance was voided, so now I'm stuck with a pretty iPhone that doesn't work.Get your phone fixed the right way if it's broken, get a case if you want it to look pretty.
