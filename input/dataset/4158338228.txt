I know the new laws for the vape stores. I know you have to pay to sample 1.00 that's fine. This guy that works here was so rude wouldn't take my dollar because that dollar will go towards whatever you purchase he said that several times. I'm used to a a bigger mod he gave me a old school battery to sample from I could barely taste it and then he had the nerve to ask me what kind of set up I had I told him a kanger cupti. This snotty little man smirked and said no what tank do you use. I told him it was a all in one piece there isn't a removable tank. WTF did I do to you I didn't piss in your cherrios today. I tried a couple flavors and they were good but this guy was a asshole. I will never go back to that empty vape store.
