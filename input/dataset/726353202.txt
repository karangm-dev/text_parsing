i wanted to write a brief update of my SMI experience.  While the charges shouldn't have happened in the first place, SMI did issue refunds for the services they provided that were covered by my insurance company...to the tune of about $700.  I have to give them props for doing the right thing and refunding me, but really these charges shouldn't have occurred in the first place.Their imaging services?  Just fine.  My recommendation?  Tell SMI to bill your insurance company, and then pay whatever you owe after it's cleared your insurance.
