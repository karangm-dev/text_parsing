If you are a craft beer geek and enjoy visiting breweries, then this is a logical next step for you.If you enjoy liquor, craftsmanship, and small business, this is up your alley.Wife and I enjoyed a couple of cocktails on a recent trip to visit our daughters.  The passion from the owner and the gentleman working the bar was impressive.  I enjoyed an old-fashioned and my wife had a drink similar to a margarita.  Picked up a couple of bottles for the road.Unique, fun experience...a must for any visitor to Madision.
