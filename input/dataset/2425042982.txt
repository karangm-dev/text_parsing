If you are looking to buy a new car and want the best possible experience then I recommend you visit Kwasi at BMW of Las Vegas.  My husband and I recently purchased a new 2014 BMW 328i and we couldn't be happier!  Our sales representative, Kwasi, took his time to listen to our wants and needs, took us for a test drive and searched his computer system for about 30 minutes until he found the exact car we were looking for.  He even had his sales manager, Steve, go to another location to pick up the exact car for us to see and test drive.  Both Kwasi and Steve were phenomenal to work with.  After the test drive we were sold, these cars drive like a dream.  They truly live up to the title "ultimate driving machine".  Kwasi quickly had the paperwork drawn up and after pairing our phones and giving us a brief overview of the cars features we were on our way.  Kwasi continued to follow-up with us after our purchase to see if we had any questions about the car and offered to have us come back in for a few minutes to go over any questions we may have.  BMW of Las Vegas offers amazing cars and a car buying experience that is like no other.  We highly recommend this dealership.
