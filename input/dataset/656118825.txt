My family and I are thrilled to have found Eddie on Yelp! We needed someone to remove a fan that was installed in the wrong place, transfer it outside, and install one in our master bedroom. After a bad experience with another contractor from Fanco, I requested a quote on Yelp. I did not want to take a chance on going through that again. He was quick to respond and confirm an appointment. Pricing was very reasonable and he came by at the time specified. Another very important thing was that our 5 year old was in awe of the whole process and he was very kind. Our fans look great and we will definitely be calling him again for more of our electrical install needs. We highly recommend Eddie!
