First time eating here, and was nothing but impressed. The staff were super friendly and helpful. Price point is great. And the food was delicious. I got the spicy potato soup, and my dad got one pork and one chicken enchilada. Everything was very fresh. Highly recommend! And will definitely come back. Apparently the festival taco won first place at the taco festival this year, next time I will definitely be trying that!
