I won't go anywhere else. They do a great job and are so accommodating! I used to have to call and book an appt a week before my dogs can get groomed. One time, I needed an emergency grooming session and I called 3 places around my area: one was closed (on a Monday), one never answered, and another one told me he wouldn't have groomers until Thursday (because they all went on a vacation together, how do u do business that way?). I finally called top groomers and they let me bring in my dogs that same hour and I picked them up a few hrs later. I LOVE that they have availability and I need that type of fast service.
