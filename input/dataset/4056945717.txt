This is by far my favorite restaurant for breakfast in Las Vegas.I cant count how many times I've come stumbling in here whether its been sun up, sun down, middle of the night, etc. The San Francisco special and the crab cake benedict are my favorite. To top this off I usually go for orange juice or some sort of cocktail or beer if I'm in the mood for another drink. I'm a fan of diner type food and the food has that feel with a Vegas party atmosphere inside the restaurant. The prices are very fair also...great food at low price is always a good thing. What can I say, I'm a fan!Breakfast 4/5/2014 - and previous visits
