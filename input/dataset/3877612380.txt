Well, the economy must be doing somewhat better because they are no longer offering the $40 all-day buffet pass.  Instead, you'll end up paying the $20/person for lunch that my group did.  This buffet has gone downhill from what it used to be.  If you, too, are looking for the lavish selection that "Las Vegas buffets" brings to my mind, go to another hotel's buffet.The best item was the fried shrimp. Prime rib was okay. And desserts, although they had a pretty good selection, tasted cheap.  Most of the bite-size portions were 90% whipped cream and 10% cake. Not worth my $20...It's okay though, I'll just go win back my lunch monies on the roulette table.
