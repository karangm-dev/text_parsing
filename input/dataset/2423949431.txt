We had just finished eating Mad Mex, then stopped at the pet store, browsing for quite some time to stare at the adorable puppies who were in humanely sitting in their own filth, and driven from downtown Pittsburgh, and all that time that transpired was still shorter than how long we had waited to get our ONE starburst freeze drink. Luckily, the drink is pretty damn good.
