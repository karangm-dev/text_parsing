Truly enjoyed working with Fred Lembo! We just closed on our first home and couldn't be happier with Fred and his team.No matter what happened in the process, he did not let us down. He always had our backs, made sure that we understood all routes and options, and made the process fun and exciting.Unlike other agents that we had worked with, Fred never made us feel like he was reluctant to show us properties. He was very patient with us throughout the process, and gave us time and space to make decisions, all while going above and beyond in the "background" to be prepared for all scenarios so that we were always "ready to go" when needed.Fred is also an excellent negotiator and helped us feel confident and comfortable with what could have otherwise been some very overwhelming circumstances.We would highly recommend Fred to anyone purchasing or selling a home. It was a privilege to work with him, Shannan, and the rest of the North&Co team!
