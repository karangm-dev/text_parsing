I'm only giving this place 2 stars as the people who run the place are the most unfriendly people I've ever encountered. They seemed angry that they were busy. I tried to be nice and make small talk and they acted like they didn't even hear me. The food was average. The hummus wasn't typical at all. It was chunky and didn't have a nice taste. I have eaten at the top Greek restaurant in the world. I know good hummus. They should really be nice to the customers they get. Madison is a small town and people will go elsewhere.
