Let's star by saying you will never see the same Dr twice also they don't know what the other is doing multiple times we went in to see one Dr then a few days later we get a call we need to come in very important the dr nees to see you .when we get there they don't even know why we are there but they sure are quick to take the copay then we took are child there and they tryed to charge us for crutches my insurance covers that why do I have to pay 35 dollars . Now I get a call I owe them 50 dollars and some change they said we did not pay a copay but when I said I know I did pay that they she said yes but it was a plied to the deductible???? No one told me that and we have been in after that and nothing was said now they are saying they added the 30 as a late fee how is it late if I paid it and you a plied it some place else that's not my fault and I gave you my updated address but you still hade the old one again not my fault that's yours I don't recommend they we are now looking for a new Dr office
