The best All You Can Eat Sushi in Toronto? It definitely lives up to its title.I went here today for my 18th birthday and absolutely loved every bite. The menu is vast with many options, ranging from regular sushi to more extravagant teriyaki and even sushi pizza (although we didn't try this).The fish was fresh and flavourful, each piece seemed to be cut and crafted with care. The chefs also add a large amount of fish, unlike most AYCE restaurants, which use too much rice to save on the cost of fish.Service was good, but they seemed a bit understaffed. There were only two waitresses serving and bussing tables for about 25 people during the evening rush.Make sure to place a reservation if you have a party of four or more! The restaurant is quite compact and the majority of the tables were filled with couples out for dinner. One group of 6 had to wait almost half an hour to get a seat.All in all, the experience was wonderful and I plan to return, despite the long drive from my home in Etobicoke.
