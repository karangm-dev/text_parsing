I came in here Saturday morning and bought a baguette and some eclairs. $12.  OK, $12, but I felt like I was bothering the cashier.  They weren't even busy and the place looked like it needed a good cleaning.  I shouldn't have to be the one who says THANK YOU.  The cashier should say THANK YOU to me.  I live nearby and don't think I'll be coming back.  Just saying.
