My wife and I have been clients of Dr. Tran and Floss Dental Orthodontics since they opened their office on West Cheyenne 9 years ago. When we moved across to the southwest side of town, we moved over to this location. All of the dentists and staff are so professional and kind. One of the most important things to my wife and I is a clean and sterile environment. The office is immaculate and is completely up to date with all of the latest technologies. We absolutely recommend this to all of our family and friends.
