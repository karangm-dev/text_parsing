An hour into our visit to this faux British sports bar, and my boyfriend and my impression of this place was just as empty as our tabletop.  We came with high hopes to find a nice place to revisit for a beer and dinner but left with a pocket full of saved tip cash, a salty tongue and zero intentions of returning.Without exaggerating, we literally sat at our bar booth for an hour before the rude waitress took our food order.  20-30 minutes later, food arrived to our table that we didn't even order.  Keeping track, we're nearly an hour and a half into sitting at this poor representation of a pub and we still haven't tasted any food.  The reason for our commitment to this place was a pre-purchased Groupon.  Alas, my feeble attempt to use tactics as learned by Extreme Couponing had totally backfired.Apparently to the waitress we weren't deserving of an apology, instead the food runner apologetically returned with our correct order 10 minutes later while the moron waitress dodged our glances.At this point I'm starving but not even my Blue Moon could help me win the battle with my terribly over-salted tuna melt.  Ok fine, in their defense, the french fries were good and the bartender was friendly but the meal was already ruined.My advice would be to go for the french fries... but get them to-go... and from The Hard Rock next door, you're sure to find similar tacky decor browsing the Motley Crue display without having to endure horrible service.
