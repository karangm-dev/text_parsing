I can't get enough of one my favorite college stomping grounds from about 15 years ago! Whether it was during my four hour long film class where I would listen to lecture for a few eat wings and beer then come back to sign in or on Wednesday nights for you call its this one of my og drinking spots back in the day. The countertops have changed from the old wood ones to granite and there is now a patio that I don't remember but the inside still looks pretty much the same. Lot more tv's all flat screens now. Pool tables towards the very back and two dining areas. I still come for the wings and cheese fries. More flavor choices than I remember but maple hot is still my go to. Its become a Saturday afternoon habit but I'm kinda surprised at how dead it is then. I don't if its because we have a lot fairweather Sun Devil fans or if this just isnt saturday afternoon football bar. Either way nothin but love for the joint!
