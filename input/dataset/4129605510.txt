The brussels sprout nachos are really as good as the other reviewers have mentioned! I've had them more then a few times and everyone always loves them, be careful because they can easily fill you up! Individual tacos and the burritos are great too. I've also had a few of their salads and love them, big a portion sizes. Great classic margarita as well, love this place for groups esp on Sunday when is all day happy hour!!
