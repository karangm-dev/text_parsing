Unfortunately, I cannot write a review on their cleaning services, I didn't even make it that far.  My first time cleaning quote was so unreasonable; I'm still stunned over the ridiculous number!  $340!  What? I have had many, many cleaning services to my home, of course they all tout that they are the best, which I have yet to find.  You truly wouldn't even believe some of the stories I have.  Anyway, I have never, and I mean never been quoted $340!  Outrageous!
