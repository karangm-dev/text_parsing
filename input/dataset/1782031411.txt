Walked in at 9:17 and some stuck up old man tells us " not sure if we have time to serve you.." they close at 10.. After ordering our food bread shows up, be sure to have doubles there because the portions are very small! The food was nothing to write home about... save your money there are way better places out there with out the attitude..
