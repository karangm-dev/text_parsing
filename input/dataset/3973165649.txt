So. Fabulouso! I'm cereal. From the chips and salsa to the green chile cheese crisp to the endless parade of margaritas and shots of tequila right down to my bean tostada, out of this world tamale and cheesey cheese ensheelotta....Well...If it were legal to marry a restaurant, I would seriously consider courting Via Delosantos. But it's not. Can't marry a goat. Can't marry a gay. Can't marry a restaurant. We had attentive and friendly service and was informed because it was 9:30 it was last call. So we ordered up! Went with my besties who are regulars so I feel as though we were extra pampered. Extremely generous tequila list. Comfortable and cozy decor. Clean restrooms. Great company and delicious food.As Arnold says "I'll be backito!"
