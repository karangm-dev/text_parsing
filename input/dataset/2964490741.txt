This place is the Mecca of diners, lined with chrome and neon lights this is the what all diners aspire to be.  I love the peppermill, because it is classic vegas.  Despite having not much for me to eat as a vegan, I still loved the atmosphere.  I had oatmeal, which was massive, so I can't speak to the food.  They have a good list of cocktails that are decent prices.  The fireside lounge is awesome, has a firepit and the ladies are all in black evening gowns.  This place is a must for everyone to visit at least once.
