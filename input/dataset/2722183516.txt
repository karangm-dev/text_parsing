The only thing great about Surrender is the outdoor view of Encore Beach Club at night during the summer. Surrender is a tiny, noisy "music box" that EDM artists spin live just "because of the money", LOL!!! It's the out-of-control lil' sister to it's much mature & stable siblings XS & Tryst inside the Wynn/Encore Paradise! Security can be a bit ridiculous on suggesting places to dance, since the dance floor is limited & stand with a chick, since the bar is always packed with broke "bar flies". I'd much rather wait 'til the sun comes up, throw on some nice swim trunks & take a dip/chill in one of the several well-designed pools of the neighboring Encore Beach Club to erase my "Surrendered Nightmare" ;-)
