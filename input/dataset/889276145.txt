The guys taking our order was very polite and helpful. Everything else was far from that is the best I can say. The completely messed up our order. Forgetting to add onions or removing pickles etc. It was just completely wrong! Not to mention when we took the food up to the front, they said it's not their fault. So whose is it then and what are we supposed to do? Eat the food we did not order for? Um no thanks. When we gave it back, it exchanged several hands and all they did was remove the toppings that were supposed to be there and added the ones we wanted instead of making a new order. I'm all for not letting things go to waste but removing mustard is a little difficult since the bread absorbs it. I was so disappointed and angry I didn't eat it. I ate the skinny fries which was good. We also got Oreo cookies and cream milkshake which was super delicious. Hence why I gave them two stars instead of zero! We came here around midnight but it was still busy. Prices are so expensive for a burger the size of McDonald cheeseburger and a kids size fries! The chairs and tables did not look wiped down and the trash was full. They have a lot of people working there so I was quite surprised to find it unkept. I did notice a few employees talking to each other or hanging by the bathroom. They really should delate the work to everyone. Maybe whoever made our orders was busy and needed help. Alas, I will not be coming back.
