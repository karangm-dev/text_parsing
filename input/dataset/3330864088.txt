600TH REVIEW!!! Had a pleasant experience here! The clerk helped me ship a package & got me the cheapest rate possible. She was very nice to me and others that encountered her. Most USPS clerks aren't the friendliest! But she was very accommodating. Kudos to her!!!! So glad I had a 5* experience on my 600th review.
