My friends wanted to go bowling last night and I suggested Club 300.  I hadn't been here for at least 5 years, but from what I remembered, it was relatively cheap and decent.I was definitely wrong.This place is where hoodlums and other forms of degenerates come to loiter, conduct drug deals, etc.  Did not feel safe entering/exiting this place even with a group of 4 ppl.We decided to go inside to check it out anyways.  The bowling alley itself isn't bad, just a bit outdated compared to Markham Bowl/World Bowl.There were at least 30 ppl standing in line at the front desk, and the line didn't move, so we ended up leaving after 5 minutes of waiting.Don't eva play yourself.  Don't come to Club 300.  Your life is not worth a cheap $5 game of bowling.
