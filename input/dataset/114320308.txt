This is one of my favorite restaurant chains due to great customer service and steak. I enjoyed the ribeye and a margarita with a shot of "patron" in there. There is normally a lengthy wait but bar is walk-in and I had zero wait . I ordered two meals plus two drinks and paid around 38 bucks. Not bad. Definitely recommend this chain location.
