I took my son for his birthday, what better way to bring in another year! We had Mike B as our guide and he was so very great! Mike really gave all the people a lot of attention, and went out of his way to help my son celebrate his special day! All the staff we experienced from check in to checking out was very kind, encouraging and just super fun to be around! We really felt taken care of from the start! We will definitely be going back, it was sooooooo much fun!
