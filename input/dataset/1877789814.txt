The best free show in Vegas.  The Fountains of Bellagio will forever hold sentimental value for me as it is the place (main center front) where I asked my wife to be my girlfriend when we first started hanging out.Stay every 15 minutes after 7pm to hear different songs with the water and lights dancing to their tune.  The fountains are beautiful, romantic, a memorable sight to see.  If you happen to be lucky, you'll hear our favorite song:  Andrea Bocelli's "Time to Say Goodbye".   The mix of high and low notes, the powerful duet, and the dancing waters will just leave you breathless by the end of the song.  You will see plenty of people dressed up as characters along the Bellagio sidewalk if you're interested in meeting them.  Take your selfies.  Spend time with your significant other.  Have some fun and it'll cost you nothing but you will remember everything.
