My fiance and I ate here on a Friday night and a Tuesday night. Atmosphere is poor, wine list expensive and not good  ($44 for an $8 bottle of wine), and the food is more miss than hit. The desserts are great though. Would have been more disappointed if I hadn't had Groupon. Wait staff were great. The cooking staff need help.
