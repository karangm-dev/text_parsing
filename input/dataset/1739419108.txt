I HATE buying cars. Today I traded in a lease and made a full payment on a new car. People can be very polarized in their opinion about car dealers, either they were the best, or the absolute worst. Jason Murdoch (GSM) and his salesman Jovi, as well as the entire team made the process seamless. I got the car for exactly how much i wanted, it was a fast process, and paperwork was pushed through in record time. I cannot, will not visit another dealership that is not in the ownership of Dave Wilson and his auto groups. Fantastic group of guys.Get the price of the car that you want at another dealership and bring it to right toyota, they will give you such a low price that will knock out the competition. Thank you for making my day awesome Jason and Jovi.
