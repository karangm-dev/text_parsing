Our family stopped into Pastoli's while in town for a family event and had a great experience. Everything from the salads to the Tiramisu were very good. Loved the Gyro pizza!! The staff was very friendly and even came out to greet us and chat briefly during the meal.  We will definitely visit Pastoli's when in town again.
