The gym itself is great. Really good variety of machines, classes and unlike LVAC, people actually work out here instead of using it as a social club. My problem is with the staff. i had an issue with my membership and tried to ask about it. The staff at the front desk said i needed to call the customer service number and speak to them so i did. I actually called twice and got the same answer both times from the operators, i could cancel my membership or talk to a club manager about my current one. Now i've been going to this gym for 3 years and i really like it here so i decided to talk to a manager about it. I've asked to speak to a manager 4 separate times and each time the same thing happens: The staff at the desk will tell me that the manager is with another guest or not there and that i can have a seat and they'll see me next. So after 20 or 30 minutes of waiting the person at the desk will tell me they don't know how much longer the manager will be and that i can leave my name/number and the manager will call me, so i do. I have never gotten a call back ever out of the 4 times this has happened. I understand that this is a gym and not some high end restaurant or retail store so i don't expect amazing customer service and its a busy gym so i don't expect help right away but to be ignored is ridiculous. Either the manager isn't getting my messages or they're ignoring it. The only reason I haven't canceled my membership yet is because like i said, i've been going here for 3 years and i really like it but this is beyond unacceptable and I've started looking at other gyms.
