Thought a place next to Harris Teeter in a Mathews strip mall would be a little kid friendly. They had 2 high chairs that were taken by others so we had to eat with the baby on our shoulder. It was a difficult meal and we rushed as fast as we could because we had to hold the baby. The establishment is not looking to have family clientele obviously. I wish there had been a review like this before we went so we would have known.
