Maybe the big name in Vegas' Strip negates consumer experience, but I still get to review it. We walked in because of a "free chocolate tasting" sign. We sat on stools in the back only to be quickly ushered off of them for the tour visitors. That's fine/fair. But telling us we "have to leave" could have been done more delicately. Offering samples is usually in the hopes of garnering purchases by enlightened costumers, maybe in wrong. We perused the extensive assortment of candies, a lot from outside of Vegas (and the store) , and found the Hexx bars costly without first sampling what you'll be buying or understanding the craft behind it. When the stools emptied, we sat down to disinterested female employee who had to be prompted for samples. We had to ask for the name of the chocolate after each sample, answered in quick snippets between chatting with other employees and in the computer. Finally frustrated with my 1 sample and my husband's 3 samples after much prompting, we left without purchasing any of the chocolate. We weren't sure what we sampled and were disappointed with the experience.
