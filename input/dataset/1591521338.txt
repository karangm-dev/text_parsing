I was very impressed by this optometrist. I was in and out in less than 30 minutes, paperwork, exam, and ordering contacts. Really liked their new system where you don't have to say "1 or 2" a bunch of times... very efficient. Dr. Beal was also really nice and talked me through everything he was doing which I appreciated. Definitely one of the best optometry experiences I've had!
