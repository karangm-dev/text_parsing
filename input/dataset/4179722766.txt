Baker Wee ha made 5 cakes for us and this experience has definitely been the worst.  The lettering was very very messy.  The Dead-pool picture was crooked.  Now to their credit they did offer to fix it however I did not have the time to wait for them to redo the cake so being my son is 9 today I did not think he would really notice.  The party went great and it was time for cake and ice cream.  No only was it supposed to be a yellow cake with strawberry cream filling it was a white cake with raspberry filling, it did have cream cheese frosting.  Tasted great just not what we ordered.  I know the bakery is under new management, but they need to get back to their roots and start caring again.  This year our cake just seemed like an after thought.
