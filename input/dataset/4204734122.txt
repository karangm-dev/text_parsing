This place is amazing! I've been trying to find a good Philly cheesesteak in the area, and I'm so glad that my husband stumbled across this place!! First, the sandwich was seriously incredible. I got the pepper cheesesteak, and everything about it was perfect--soft delicious bread, tender meat, marinated grilled bell peppers, perfect amount of American cheese... It was DELICIOUS! On top of that, the people and the environment were so friendly and inviting! The older gentleman at the register, Mark (maybe the owner?) was so sweet and helpful. They were all so cute with my four year old son (who also LOVED his ham and cheese sandwich!)--as a mom, of course that made me happy :). I HIGHLY recommend this place and I will definitely be going back!!
