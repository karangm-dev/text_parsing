After trying to color my hair myself I found Copectic and Marie! Marie is fabulous and listened to what I wanted to do and the end result was amazing!! The salon is very comfortable and has a great feel to it! Beverages and snacks are offered as well. They do all kinds of hair treatments as I have noticed quite a lot of fabulous before and afters! Below is a photo of my freshly colored hair. Love the multi dimension colors in it! Perfect every time! Try Marie and you won't be disappointed!
