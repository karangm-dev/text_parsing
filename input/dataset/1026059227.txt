Went to this place after our car was totaled in an accident. We have a pretty packed schedule so we went to look at the car we were interested in on Sunday. It was closed despite the hours posted on the door stating it should be open.We gave them a second chance and went in a few days later. Salesman was ok until we got in the car and were driving. He was sitting in the back seat and was giving my husband directions where he wanted him to go. My husband is somewhat hard of hearing and didn't hear him. The salesman made a rude remark. That wasn't the last time. We loved the car. We were told we'd need a consigner due to student loans we had at the time. They showed us other cars that weren't as expensive, but we weren't interested in them. The car we were looking at it turns out was priced 4,000 more than other dealerships that were selling the same Make, model and trim virtually the car we were trying to buy's twin. We kept looking and found that we were treated a lot better at another dealership, Metro Lexus. We love our Lexus and we didn't need a consigner.  Just seems to me that this dealership doesn't work with that many lenders. After reading the other reviews I'm glad we didn't purchase a car from this dealership.
