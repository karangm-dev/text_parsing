At my very first appointment with Dr. Bellota, she put me on a medication I told her made me very ill in the past. She swore I was just taking it wrong. Low and behold I went back on it and took it to her directions and got extremely sick. I vomited all over myself at work. When I told her she made me come in a couple days later to discuss. When I got there she wasn't even in and I had to see a different Doctor. He changed me to another medicine. My third appointment she made me go over what the other Doctor did instead of reading my file. She then was condescending about the medicine THE OTHER DOCTOR put me on. I'm not a doctor, I didn't choose it. This medicine eventually made me ill also. I emailed her about it and she didn't bother responding.Here I sit for my 4th appointment that was supposed to be 45 minutes ago and I haven't been seen yet.Dr. Bellota doesn't listen to her patients, she over books to collect additional insurance premiums and rushes you out after 5 minutes when she eventually does get to you, she is very disorganized as you can tell from her office. It's like a factory line. You wait and wait and then get 5 minutes, she doesn't listen and just sends you on your way to make another appointment. I've missed so much time at work to leave early to see her to only sit here and have my time wasted. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt but after 4 visits of this treatment, I can no longer justify the sub-par treatment at this office.Do yourself a favor and look for a different Doctor. I know I will be doing so. It's not a coincidence that she only has 1 star reviews.
