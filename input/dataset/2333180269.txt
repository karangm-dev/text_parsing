We dine here frequently as we are always visiting Vegas. This is one of my favorite restaurants but I had a bad experience here today- I have a severe allergy to onions and the waiter took the order correctly but the chef decided to cook my food with onions and what looks like tried to pick them out but they were still there. Long story short my throat started closing and I found a few of the onions in my beef hor fun. I requested for the manager to come so I could address the issue- was that a mistake. She looked at me like I was in the wrong and the waiter even said the kitchen made a mistake. Nonetheless she didn't apologize- nor try to remedy the issue, I hope they don't make this a common practice because I will stop coming here if this is the direction they are going to treat repeat clients.
