Timing is everything. And because of the movie I really wanted to see, along with everyone else, it was really busy. Which I don't understand why we had to purchase our tickets at the concession stand while the ticket desk was CLOSED!!!We waited in line for 30-minutes to purchase tickets because the line was moving very slow as people were also making decisions on purchasing food and waiting for it.  Now of course, we could purchase our tickets online, but when we checked, the show we wanted to see was practically sold out. And just for the heck of it, we wanted to double check with someone;  which didn't changed. We ended up not watching the movie and left.Plain and simple, this comes down to operations management that should know better that on a major movie opening weekend, like Star Wars, you need a fully staffed team to ensure efficiency and comfort of your customers. The reason why? Because there are plenty of options, we're taking our business elsewhere.First impressions mean everything and you can tell, this was an absolutely terrible experience for my husband and I. We have plans to never return to this theater.
