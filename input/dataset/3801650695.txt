So I have an update for my previous review.  Since purchasing my vehicle in May of 2015 the first year about every 6 weeks I received a  phone call, not to see how the car was functioning or if I would like an oil change but to have someone try to get me to upgrade my vehicle.  In the beginning I would be really nice and would tell the no thank you, then I got a little meaner as time went on and I told them that I was not "upgrading" my vehicle and my payment, I was not stupid and didn't need to upgrade a perfectly fine car.  At about the end of 2015 I asked to be removed from the call list.  By 2016 I started to get the calls about every 3 month and it was the same conversation me getting a little ruder and nastier each time.  So fast forward to 2017 I have received a call like clockwork every three months.  The last one I politely went off on the girl and told her to remove my name from the list and I have move to Reno (this is actual).  She thanked me for my time and said she would.  Today, 3 months later, I get a call from a sales guy, being extremely car salesman-ey trying to get me to upgrade, I start by telling him in no way shape or form will I ever buy a car from Newport again and this is ridiculous I want off this list!  He hung up on me.  I want people that look at these reviews and to stop and think do I want to deal with this?  I think they think we are stupid, to upgrade a perfectly good running car just because is a set up for "we want you to spend more money" and will profit from this practice. If you like upgrading your car and upgrading your payment then this is defiantly the auto store for you.   Why should I upgrade when the car gets me from point A  to B and safely.  That is the only nice thing that I will say about Newport is that they did not sell me a lemon.
