This organization was willing and able to take in a stray cat from my area when no one else had "room at the inn"  I had been feeding this little stray and had become very attached to it but could not adopt it. The lady that came to my house to pick up the stray was very sweet and caring.  I could tell she truly had a heart for animals.  I was so grateful that they were able to take it in this cat and care for it.  They are now looking for a home for this cat.  I will never forget how kind and caring they were.
