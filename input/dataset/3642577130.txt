It's a standard hotel, meaning okay/decent amenities but lacking in customer service.   I'm Hyatt Platinum status and just experienced a confrontation with the front desk but was unable to come to means with the staff.  I chose to walk away rather than waste my breathe.  Probably will not be staying here again over a simple "Policy" issue!
