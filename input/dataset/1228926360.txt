Very nice ambiance. Nice open space. 2 patios, ample bar, friendly waitstaff. If you are looking for a casual but nice ambiance, then this place may be for you. However, I sat at the bar, and I was the only one there. It seemed that the bartender was more interested in prepping the bar for higher volume than even seeing if i needed more bread or having any conversation at all. I felt more like a nuisance than a paying customer. He served me some very old wine which he promptly changed out when I complained. As for the food, I ordered three pieces of bruschetta bread and one glass of wine. Those two items came up to be over $30. I could imagine paying as much if I were getting top-notch service with exceptional food, but the food was hastily put together and while somewhat flavorful, I would have paid $5 instead of $30!  I am CERTAIN that this place is severely overpriced.
