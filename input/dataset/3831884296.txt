Nope. Never going back.10pm at night, empty waiting area, and we wait 3 hours to be seen.  The MA taking vitals has NO bedside manner for working with children.  And this place only serves children, so that's a huge turn off.  The receptionist clearly wanted to be elsewhere.  I get it, being at work is not the best, but it's part of being a grown up, so at least fake being friendly?The doctor was too fast.  I don't feel like he spent even 5 minutes with us.  I don't think he listened to our problem, I don't think he gave my child a proper exam for the complaint presented, and I don't think he was all that great with kids either.  For being a new facility, as in they just moved here, it was dirty.  Things were dusty, the floor needed a good sweeping and mopping.  The exam rooms were dingy and several lights were already burned out in the place.  I was desperate, couldn't wait until the following morning for the urgent care we usually go to, and the ER would be overkill for the issue.  But I do not recommend Good Night. At all.
