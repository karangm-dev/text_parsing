This is the best Persian restaurant for a date night. I came here for a second time. There were 2 birthday parties here and they played Persian happy birthday songs. The service was as amazing as my first visit. The staff was very well mannered and attentive. I love the decor and the food is simply delicious. I tried the Kabab Torsh and Kashke Bademjan. The kabab torsh is very different from other Persian restaurants. It doesn't have that walnutty taste, instead it's simply marinated in plain sour pomegranate sauce. They make their own yogurt drink with walnut powder and it's quite thick and very delicious.What they can improve on:The feta cheese amount for the complimentary appetizer was too little for two people. Also, their bathroom needs more attention in terms of looks and decor. I'm not trying to sound cheap but they charge $1 if you ask for water. Isn't that supposed to be complimentary everywhere?
