Awful! Floor was so dirty that my shoes almost came off due to sticky substance.Also unruly teenagers have taken over this theater. It is no longer possible to enjoy a movie at this location. This location is merely a babysitting service for parents to drop off their entitled, disrespectful brats. In turn, they ruin everyone else's movie experience.
