Save your money and go someplace else!!!!! This restaurant which is located right on the strip is in an amazing location however the food was absolutely dreadful. I ordered the trash can nachos and they literally tasted like they came out of the trash can.  They use Velvetta cheese for nachos can you imagine?I paid $47 for a sweet tea vodka drink and trash can  nachos and the nachos were so bad I literally left three quarters of them on the plate. On a positive note Jackie was our server and she was absolutely delightful.  Save your money go elsewhere.
