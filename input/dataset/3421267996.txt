Lets get this out of the way right now, I gave this place 1 star because they are a bike shop that has bikes, not good bikes but bikes non the less. Walked in with the wife to find her a bike to ride around the neighborhood. What I really love is when you walk into a buisness and you get nothing but silence from the 3 people working behind the counter. So we walk around looking at the bikes on the racks for about 15 awkward minutes before somone finally asks us what we are looking for. We say a cruising bike mainly. He picks out a dark purple bike that is just covered in scratches. "That bike has alot of scratches on it" I say to him. "Yeah it happens" he responds. You got me, it does happen. My wife then asks a question about getting white wall tires instead of just plain black tires and he tells us it will be 50 to 60 dollars more to get them! Now some might be say well they have to pay to get them, but as it so happens we also went to a bike shop by Arrowhead and they would do it for free. They didnt have a very good selection of bikes in the store so I ask them what kind of special orders do you have? He hands me a book to look at and my wife finds one she likes. " How long does it take to get in?" I ask. " About a month, mabye longer." Wow.... thats a long time considering we special ordered a bike from another bike shop and got it in a week with free replacment white wall tires. If your looking for a bike then just skip this place and go to one of the better shops out there that wont try and sell you there bad stock and nickle and dime you in the process.
