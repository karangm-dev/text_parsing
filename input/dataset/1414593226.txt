I've been coming to iq smog for my diesel truck for years plus all my friends and family but had a very bad experience today. After my truck passed I asked the new employee skinny mid age dude how much I owe him he replied 69 bucks so I'm like wow I've always got charged 45 bucks and he lost it and started acting very rude and nervous saying all kinds of things like your lucky I don't charge you 110, it is what it is your paying it I told him let me make a phone call just go ahead and help the next customer and he madly replied I don't have time for this. I called the owner very nice people and explained the situation she was very nice and have told me that government pricing went up and she told me since I'm a old customer she can do it for 55 so I thank her and agreed to pay such amount but had to let her know how rude her guy was. So after I payed and before I left told the employee that he should treat old customer a bit nicer and he just lost it telling his boss how rude and disrespectful I was with him, total lie. That's why I will not go to this place ever again just because of the bad attitude of that one guy. Thanx and I hope this help to anyone who reads it.
