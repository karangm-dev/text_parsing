After a horribly disappointing week of dining we found this gem tucked away inside the rio we arrived just in time for the lunch buffet it was the food highlight of our trip! Everything was full of flavor and wonderfully prepared! The staff was amazingly friendly can't wait to go back our next trip to Vegas!
