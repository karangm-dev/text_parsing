I got a 10 class Groupon to try out the classes, because I always suspected this kind of fitness is the only kind that will keep me interested. And boy oh boy, I was right!The classes are loaded onto your account, and the easiest way to book the class is online, or via their app. The classes open up 72 hours (or 3 days) before the actual class, and these things fill up QUICK. So, some planning ahead is required. They do have waitlist available, which means if someone cancels, you get their spot. Beware of their cancellation policies, though - give it a good read and realize that this will be a commitment of your time, or else you're paying! I have no problem with this, but I can see where others who are prone to changing-plans might find this tedious.The classes themselves are upbeat and fun, and always loaded with awesome music. I think I've tried at least 4 of the instructors in Pole Beginner 1 now, and they all have a different "style" but they stick to the same syllabus, in terms of moves you need to master to move up the classes. You can't just jump ahead - they make sure you've got these moves down before they'll promote you. I love the classes because they have equal parts fitness, dance, and just plain ol' sexiiiii girliness. Sexy crawls on the floor? Twerking? hair flips??? Yes, yes, and yes, and with some upper body strength too.My Groupon is coming to an end soon, and then they'll be looking at a regular Vixen!
