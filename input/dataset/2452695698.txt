No thanks! Never again. So I go to this restaurant which is in CANADA and I'm excited to get some Kung Pao chicken, rice and an ice cold beer. Lady tells me this is muslim restaurant, therefore no alcohol served! WHAT?!!? It's not like I forced a Muslim to drink alcohol. Anyways... on to the food. Chicken dish was relatively cheap, $9.99, can of coke $1.50. I've had much better Chinese food for that price. I will not return.
