Our meal started out so well with the beets, apples and squash appetizer.  Very fresh and tasty dish.  We were also impressed with the restaurant itself as its very nice and the service quite good.  Unfortunately, the main dishes were not that good. The steak was a little bland and tough.  The lobster fettucine was not good at all. We actually sent it back and got a soup which wasn't that good either.
