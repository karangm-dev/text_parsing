I had an appointment today at 4:00 pm with Kenny. I walked in at 4:00 pm sharp and Kenny had just sat a guy in the barber chair. I showed him our text message conversation that confirmed my appointment and all he said was "Give me time". I left immediately, drove to another barber shop two miles down the road on Durango, and got a haircut. There is no shortage of quality barber shops in Las Vegas. You're fired Kenny, and since you represent Pro Cuts they're fired too.
