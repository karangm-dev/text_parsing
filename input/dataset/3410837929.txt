Today I took my son for the Shoe Tying Class in the kids shoe department. What a nice free event! Kids sometimes learn better from other people and in less than 30 minutes my son was tying his shoes. Jasmine worked with my son individually and had such care and patience. No one ever pushed buying any shoes, but I did decide to buy some converse with laces so he can keep practicing at home. The laces are kind of short so Jasmine offered to swap out for some longer laces from a larger size shoe so he can practice better. Such great service! We love Nordstrom and Jasmine was such a sweet heart.
