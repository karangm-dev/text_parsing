Horrible service and communication. Owner was very rude and lacked professionalism even after acknowledging a mistake on his website that lead me to believe I could get a hand wash at 4:45 pm when hours of operation 8:00am -7:00pm. I drove 30 minutes and he didn't seem to care and instead walked away leaving an argumentative employee behind. Too many options in Charlotte to give this place my business.
