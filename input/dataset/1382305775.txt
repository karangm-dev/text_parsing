Anjoly Molina was Great! When we first walked in she greeted us with a friendly and warm smile... I felt really relief and didn't feel the pressure and bad vibes that a sales person always  gives out... She was easy to talk to and she was very knowledgable about her product!! Gave us the time and respect. And was very patient with us... I was clueless of what I wanted but at the end we bought our new mattress with her... It arrived the next day and we love it! Very happy with our purchase.... It's great to know we have 100+ days to exchange  just in case we not happy but I don't see that happening. The guys from delivery where nice and very fast... Over all it was a great experience thank you Anjoly for all your help... :)) I would recommend her anytime!!!
