Brunch will never be the same.It has been a week since we were here so I already forgot my servers name.. But he was AMAZING. We opted for the AYCE menu with the AYCD mimosas. Since everything on the menu sounded delicious, he started us off with his recommendations. He also informed us that they had different flavored mimosas so each time he refilled our glasses, it was with a new flavor. We tried every flavor they had to offer. And boy were we tipsy.My favorite dish was probably the shrimp and grits! Again, if you haven't noticed a trend in my reviews.. I LOVE SEAFOOD so anything with it, I will love it. Other faves were the steak and eggs, breakfast fries and the waffles. YUMMMM and out of the mimosa flavors, my favorite would have to be the peach one!Will definitely be back next time I'm in sin city!
