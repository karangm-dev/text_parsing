Not my type of breakfast place. Food was good and server was attentive but it is small, loud and the offerings on the menu are not your standard fare breakfast. Portions are also small. If you are into small, loud restaurants then this is for you. I would recommend them adding more, covered seating outside. We, unfortunately, were sat next to a group of obnoxious people whom were cussing loudly and just being rude and staff did nothing to remedy the situation. A restaurant of this size cannot afford to let this happen.
