This is certainly the best shop in Scottsdale for all of your pets needs.  I love everything and everyone at this shop.  Megan, "The chief cook and bottle washer," always brings a smile to anyone who enters. She is educated in the products the store sells and shows sincere and loving interest in yourself and your pet.I use Sherry as a groomer and she never fails to uphold my high standards!  She goes beyond being a professional.  She is punctual and very caring for you and your pet.   For myself and my "monkey". there is no where else!!
