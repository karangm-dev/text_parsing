Sadly another negative review In the past few months I tried to purchase items at this store that their website said was in stock and then turned out all they have is the display model or a open box. You can't call ahead to find out if products are in stock because you can't talk to a person. Their automated phone service wants you to use their website to check for product availability which has turned out to be wrong on numerous occasions. I can no longer waste anymore time driving to Frys just to find out they are out of stock when their website said the opposite. Sorry  Frys, Amazon.com now gets the business.
