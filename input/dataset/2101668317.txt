This is a place I really wanted to like, but I simply can't give it a higher than a two star rating at this point.Easily the best part is the food.  There's a lot to choose from between snacks, drinks, noodles and full dinners, they have it all.  I honestly liked pretty much everything I've tried here in two visits, which is nice.  The place is honestly pretty clean too so it's got that going for it.The service was a complete trainwreck though.  Tables were full when we got there and I had to ask three times as to how long the wait was.  I'd ask and they'd walk away each time without responding.  Seriously?  Our group of four ordered and we got two drinks and one meal before anything else, even before any of the four sides/appetizers that were ordered.  Those came last, for whatever reason.  I actually never got the water I asked for twice.  How do you screw that up?  I actually asked and the waitress and she said they were really busy... which is fine... but it's water, come on.  Near the second half of our visit, we couldn't actually find any staff members either.  Didn't check up on us for a solid half hour and flagging them down took longer than it should've because they were talking among each other way too much.  The food and drinks are a tad overpriced, but if service was at a passable level, I wouldn't mind it nearly as much.Parking's almost equally as bad, just because of all the people there for the various services / restaurants in the area.  If the mall was actually decent, no one would ever get a spot.This place fails on so many levels and I'm reluctant to even give them two stars.  The entire place's staffing either needs replacing or retraining.
