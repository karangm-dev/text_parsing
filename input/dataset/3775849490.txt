Hmmm I am a darn huge fan of Kimpton hotels however when I booked here they failed to tell me there was street and building construction going on during my overnight stay. Tisk tisk. This hotel met Kimpton standards in decor and food and their famous happy hour but I never expected not to be told about construction jack hammers and all. Will not stay at this particular location again for that lack of service.
