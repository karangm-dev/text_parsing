Definitely try this place out! I ordered the spicy tonkatsu ramen, takoyaki, and green tea ice cream and I'm so happy that I gave this restaurant a go! The spicy tonkatsu ramen's broth was flavorful and delicious, the pork was juicy and melt-in-your-mouth tender and the noodles were so fresh and delicious, you could tell they were homemade with a lot of care. The takoyaki was by far some of the best I've ever had, and the green tea ice cream was an excellent sweet finish to a satisfyingly delicious meal. Not to mention, the owner and employees were absolutely delightful. Can't wait to come again next time! :)
