This is an okay location as for organization and the store was pretty clean. However the cashier's are ONLY when you are making purchases. When making a return with tags still attached and receipt in hand they make you wait and wait in line. Then they are rude. I purchased a girls pair of MK shoes. My daughter wore them twice and they literally started coming apart while she was wearing them at school.  Talk about embarrassing for my 10year old. So much for buying brand name.
