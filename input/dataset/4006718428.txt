Thanks to Donald Johnson and Raul at Fast Fix Jewelry who changed my wedding ring from dull and missing diamonds to beautiful and complete. The turn around was overnight whereas other jewelers wanted it for over a week. The new stones are so identical to the original I can't tell the difference. If you have jewelry in need of repair go see Fast Fix Jewelry at Fashion Square in Scottsdale or at Chandler Mall. Thanks Fast Fix Jewelry and Raul for returning my ring to its original new state 17 years later.
