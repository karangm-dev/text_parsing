I waited in line for 45 minutes to get my car. I then had to wait 45 more minutes while they "washed" my car. Car rentals are new experience for me. I didn't realize how big of a deal it is to take a car from one location and drop it off at another. I'm upset that this wasn't  clearly stated especially for somebody that has no experience renting cars. They should take a little more time with that person just to make things clear. It ended up costing me almost double what I was supposed to pay to drop the car off at a different airport. That's what you get for going cheap so next time I'll pay a little bit more and hope for a better experience.
