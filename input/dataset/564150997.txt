Dr. Kotoske is terrible. Please go anywhere else. I did a rhinoplasty a few years back and he made my nose worse. My new nose looks swollen and it still hurts. I complained to him that my nose is not what I wanted, instead of redoing the surgery, he gave me multiple steroid shots every 6 weeks. They did absolutely nothing but hurt. I am more self conscious about my nose than ever. It's not like it's a one time mistake. He did the same exact thing to my sister's nose 6 months later. So this is a habit. He made every excuse in the book claiming it's his "professional" opinion. Well it can't be a professional opinion when you make something worse. From one civilized person to another, please don't go to him. It will save you money and time. This guy obviously only cares about money and doesn't care about screwing anyone over.
