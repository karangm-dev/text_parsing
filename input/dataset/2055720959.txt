Not bad but not the best.We've eaten here twice. The first time was so-so, the second time was better.  Food-wise(Gross out side note: their bathrooms need better ventilation. The second time we ate here, we were seated on the side near the bathroom. Let's just say that after someone went in, we had to move to the other side of the restaurant to escape the smell.)The price is okay. Better if you have a student ID.
