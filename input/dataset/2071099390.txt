I probably would give 2.5 stars if possible. Our server Sam was nice but it took so long to get our food- maybe 40 minutes. With an 18 month along we weren't amused. Food was okay- I prefer a more dough like crust instead of a cracker like crust. Pricing what you would expect in Toronto North. I'm not clamoring to go back.
