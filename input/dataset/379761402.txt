Really expected more from this place, especially considering its location. I'm not sure why everyone complimented the service. Our server Brooke came over about twice the entire hour we were there. Once to take our order and once to take our credit card. No check-in or water refills. Hell, she didn't even offer us water. No alert to let us know why it took FOURTY-FIVE minutes to receive our food. Which was luke warm at best. So disappointed. Will not return. Will not recommend.
