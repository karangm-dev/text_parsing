Waitress and waiters are really nice but other than that this place is not the best service.Our table had no drink menus. Our cheese sticks were not hot, warm but the cheese wasn't even melted. No utensils or napkins and took forever to get one. Main dish wasn't hot. My main thing was hot food! Probably coordination between when to take the food to the guests needs help!!
