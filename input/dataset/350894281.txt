I completely understand that construction needs to be done to the hotel to improve it. However that construction does not need to start at 6:30am! It woke us up and it was horribly loud so we could not get back to sleep. They could not move us until 11am. So much for our sleep! Also, the hallways smells like sewage. When my friend called housekeeping to request a few more pillows, the woman she spoke to gave her a huge attitude. And I think the beds are made of concrete. Do not be fooled into staying here just because it's cheap. It's cheap for a very good reason: it's horrible!!
