I'm new here, so new that I haven't officially moved in yet; I hadn't seen the Yelp reviews before now. When I arrived to do the finally paper work I was so disappointed, I wanted to cry. I rented the place site unseen; I expected something nicer & with a different floor plan, the photos online are A LOT nicer than the place. I am sure I saw wood or laminate flooring in the pictures & was disappointed to walk in to see carpet in the living room; on day one the washer & microwave did not work. Advice to potential renters: while it's not horrible, for the area & price you might be expecting something different; you should make your choice onsite, do not rely on the online photos.The ONLY saving grace right now is the staff; the three ladies in the office have been professional, SUPER nice and accommodating & the maintenance was very fast to replace the washer; as for the apartments I'm not so sure about. I will return to Charlotte next month to officially move in and will edit my review if necessary.
