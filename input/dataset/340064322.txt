I don't know when I've ever been pleased with having a repair done......until today!  My snowthrower auger was bent and I expected to need a replacement which ran around a hundred bucks plus labor.  And then there's a hassle of getting the machine TO the repair shop!   Haight's made all my problems go away with just one phone call.    He was right on time and surprised me when he said he thought he could bend the auger back into shape.   Sure enough, he fixed the auger so well that I couldn't tell the unbent auger from the one he had fixed!   The repair bill was very reasonable, but best of all, they are a MOBILE service and will come to you.  And for less than I'd expect to pay in a repair shop where I would have to muscle that heavy machine to get it there.    I highly recommend Haight's Mobile!
