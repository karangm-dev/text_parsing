I have been going here for quite some time (years) and each time seems to be getting worse  The male nail tech for sns did a TERRIBLE job...nails are bumpy, odd shaped and he cut my nails low and then kept filing I have about no nails left!  Also, this man is RUDE.  Any correction or request was met with a roll of the eye and attitude.  For the hefty charge to take care of nails, we should be treated like queens!  Do they forget this is a LOT of money...and for attitude and crappy work and no real concern for the customer, I will never go to this salon again.  My daughter, separate times, experienced the same thing.  This place has gone downhill.  Find another salon!  Also, charging an extra 5 dollars to dip ONE NAIL in a different color is ballsy.  Just a money grab here.  Time for new ownership.  These guys are running this business into the ground. They lost 2 loyal customers.  Based on the reviews here...looks like more that that!
