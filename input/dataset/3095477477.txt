We got free tickets tonight to see Barry Manilow through a seat filler web site. Neither of us are huge Manilow fan, but I was looking forward to the concert.It didn't start out too great. I was thirsty so I bought a water which was $4 for a small 8 oz. bottle. Hardly a great deal but I can't complain too much as that was the sum total I paid for our night out at the concert.When the concert started my wife and I just kind of looked at each other and grinned/shook our heads. We weren't sure what we'd gotten ourselves into, but the first song or two were NOT good. I told my wife it would/should get better.Fortunately it did. The songs got better and more familiar as the night progressed. As Christmas is approaching he also threw in several holiday songs.The singing was interspersed with audio and video of his younger years. My favorite part was when he played a record his grandpa recorded of him when he was four. He had quite a voice back then. Now his voice is showing sings of his age and at times sounds more like he's talking than singing. His body is also showing signs of aging, as he gingerly moved about the stage.Overall, we had a good time. However, I don't think I'd pay to see the show.
