My vehicle was parked by Stephen of Epic Valet at 2211 E Camelback Rd Phoenix, AZ on October 2nd next to a wall, he struck the wall while parking my car leaving deep scratches on the left rear quarter panel and the bumper, then covered the damage up with white tape since my car is whiteAfter reporting the damage to Epic Valet their answer was to take them to court, but I will need a lawyer because the security footage from 2211 E Camelback to prove they did the damage requires a subpoena according to the property manager (I have already checked into obtaining this).  So it requires retaining a lawyer, more money would be spent in legal fees to prove my case then it would cost to fix the car myself and they are well aware of this.  They did $1100 of damage to my car and I am left with the bill for their careless attendant.
