I'm sure this was exciting for many people. I, however, could not wait for the torture to end. Too loud, uncomfortable chairs and sucky if you're not a Beatles fan. Maybe the "regular" cirque show would have been a more worthwhile experience.Had to exit to ask an attendant for ear plugs so that I could rejoin my party and not appear rude.
