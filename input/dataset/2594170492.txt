We were really excited to try Oak! It's walkable and the menu looked great. First impressions were very disappointing. It smelled like burnt plastic when we walked in. (Maybe an issue in the kitchen? Very strange.) The atmosphere is that of a hotel lobby restaurant. The ceilings are impossibly high, the decor is cold, lights were too bright and the tables & chairs were out of place. The two top tables were really tight (think Valentine's Day crammed together). It was not the romantic atmosphere we anticipated. The service was great and the food was fine. We had oysters, tuna, rib eye and Brussel sprouts. Overall I was really let down by Oak- almost entirely due to the atmosphere.
