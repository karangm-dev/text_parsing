The only reason this place is around is because it's one of the only halal places offering a dine in experience with western themed food. The service is horrendous. Staff talk instead of walking around to see what customers need service and avoid eye contact.You wait hours for your food, even when they aren't busy. One time we had waited 30 minutes and when asking the waiter what was the delay he told me that typical wait time is 1 hour. 60 minutes for my food??? Just ridiculous As more halal places pop up with proper service they will suffer unless they make drastic changes
