Having supper with a friend who I hadn't seen in a while at Enoteca Monza.  We started with the butcher's board and crostini bruschetta which were really fresh and tasty.  We then had the rucola pizza and the penne Gigi.  The prosciutot, mozzarella,  and the arrugula were fresh and the pizza dough wasn't over cooked so it was both crispy and soft.  As for the penne Gigi it was perfect.  Just the right balance of cream an tomato sauce and the pancetta wasn't over cooked.   Over all it was a spectacular meal
