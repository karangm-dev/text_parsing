Food-good, service-friendly, cleanliness-awful. If your looking for a clean place to enjoy you coffee and bagel try someplace else! Tables dirty, floor dirty and drink station dirty. Asked staff to wipe down a table because none where clean, she came out and wiped down 1 table and left the rest dirty. REALLY?
