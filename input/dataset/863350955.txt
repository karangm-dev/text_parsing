Seafood lacking soulAfter watching a movie at the theatres, we decided to go and indulge in some seafood (party of two). This was our second time eating here and the impression Big Sur Oyster Bar made on us the second time was just like the first; lacking customer service, fast-paced, and with no personality. I understand that this may be a high volume restaurant with majority of the people wanting to get in and out, but I believe every restaurant should have a bit of passion for customer service.  I also understand that each restaurant has its own culture, but a restaurant in a major off-the-strip hotel should have a pinch or two more. The food is decent. The Jambalya is soulless. The Combo Pan Roast lacks the flavor. It's sad when the best part of the meal is the table bread.The customer service is sub-par with the servers at the bar gossiping about work drama and not even making eye contact to the customers. There was no suggestions for specials or meals, and our glasses of water were kept empty for the whole meal.  However, they were extremely quick to cash us out, which was probably a good thing. Pros:  conveniently located in the Southpoint HotelCons:  customer service & foodOver all 1.8 stars for poor customer service and no flavor to the food.
