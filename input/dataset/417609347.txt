Don't bother paying to reserve a table. I paid a month ahead of time for a table showed on time for the reservation. Because they require reservations to be there by 8:30 and my party was half their audience for the first 60-90 minutes while the place was dead. When my friend tripped on their wet floor and ran into the photo booth they came by a half hour later to say she needed to leave because she was too drunk. A half hour after the incident when I had been buying hundreds in drinks all night and they had no problem serving her for another half hour. When the bouncers didn't think I was listening they called her "a dumb c*nt" and a myriad of other inappropriate comments. When I asked for this gentleman's name he refused and wouldn't even give me the name of a manager. When I did speak to a manager he had nothing to say about their policy on how their employees talk about guests in front of paying customers. I have been a long time frequent visitor of low key. But I'm not sure that will continue. In fact they lost a party of 18+ people buying multiple drinks all night.I understand them having policies about removing overly intoxicated people. I hadn't had one drink that night and found it very frustrating that they weren't willing to have an honest conversation with me about why the behavior was inappropriate.Went over to El Heife and enjoyed the rest of our evening without issue.
