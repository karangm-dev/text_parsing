Definitely a regular here. This was a great quick stop for any situation, here I would recommend any of the breakfast burritos that are available all day, and also the carne asada burrito is superb, if you aren't as hungry go with the rolled tacos, great filler that comes with some bomb guacamole. This place never disappoints. In my opinion this location on chandler heights and gilbert has better slightly better tortillas than its partner papa chevos on queen creek and Val vista, but both are still very satisfying.
