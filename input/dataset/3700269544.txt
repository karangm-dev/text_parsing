The repair worked for a short time.  They were to fix the spring.  They repaired the spring seemingly, but within the year, the arm that pulls the door up broke from the door and I had to pay another charge.  Within the year, the door would not respond to detaching the arm with the power was out.  Now we are over to the next year.  My door tore up!!!  The arm detached, a panel was split, and the metal folded.  I called the company back and I got the ...you must pay us once again to come out and improperly fix your door.  I called the Original Overhead Door Company.  They were more expensive, but you get what you pay for.  They repaired the door by reinforcing what the arm was attached to.  What did they say....the arm was improperly attached, that the door and the iron should have never folded like it did.  Thankfully my door is still good but needs new panels as they were split and new iron across the bar as it was bent.
