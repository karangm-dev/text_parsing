This is the best place ever for pets.  My two babies love it here.  Both pups are rescue pups.  Mya turned 10 today and has medical issues. Carey the groomer is just so good with her and her bro Max.  The pups went to another place before and were terrified. They come here for grooming or boarding and are beyond happy with wagging tails.  Jacque and her staff are not here just to have a job. They are here because they genuinely care about animals. The location is out of my way however it is beyond worth the drive.  Thank you Pete and Mac's for taking care of my babies. Also thank you for being so good to all of us.
