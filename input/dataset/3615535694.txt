Hands down best Bloody Mary ever. So many things in my BM, veggies  mmm bacon.  "Nailed it" it's an appetizer. I also had the burger with fries. Who knew fries could be so good. The presentation doesn't disappoint ether. Very nice. Great seating outside although we sat inside. Would love to see this restaurant near my hometown. Seriously. Get the BM. You rock Guy!
