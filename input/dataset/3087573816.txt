I am writing about the branch in El Mirage on Grand.  I brought my machine in to  to see how to thread it .  i had been told it was broken.   I said i had never used the machine, Judy showed me how to thread it and suggested I take a class.  She recommended this one class, so  I signed up to make a small quilted bag and was told by Judy I would have a nice teacher who would teach me about quilting.  I was also given a list of items to bring to class.  Well, when i got to class, I forgot one item, and was chastised for that, and the teacher was so condescending, she made me feel horrible so I walked out.  I was told when I signed up that this was a great class for me, the teacher would help me... and what a lie... just the opposite.  Are they that hard up for a $10 class?   And now they don't know how to refund my money!!!   Anyway, the ladies in the class were nicer and more helpful than the teacher.  So go elsewhere... I won't be back.
