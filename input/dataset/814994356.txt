I've been here so many times over the past 10+ years, but every year it seems to seriously decline even more. There are hardly any places worth going to here anymore, besides probably Macy's, at least for me. There's still a sparse amount big name stores here, but they are aimed mostly at the teen crowd. The rest are all these random pop-up stores that just sit there and are empty every time I see them, like the supposed-"fun" places like the monster bubbles, glow golf, fortune telling... yeah..The location of this mall seems pretty good to me, which is why I'm surprised it's declining so bad. It really does need some help. Otherwise I recommend shopping at other malls with better selections like Fashion Square, AZ Mills, Arrowhead.
