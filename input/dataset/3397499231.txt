I purchased a Groupon for Elements, even though this location was on the opposite side of town.  Let me tell you, it was well worth the drive.  I had the best massage ever, I was almost sleeping during the massage.  Anthony was great.  I went back to him a second time, and I took my mom too.  Highly recommend going to see him.
