BIGGEST WASTE OF TIME. I would give zero stars if I could. This company has been giving me the run around for over a week!!!!! I've been trying to submit my application to rent and they keep giving me the excuse "the property manager isn't in today." I called on Friday and Saturday, only for them to tell me they would get back to me by the end of the day, which they did not. I called Monday and once again the property manager "isn't available till Wednesday" I call Wednesday and apparently the property manager isn't here all week!!!! What kind of company are you running? Absolutely doesn't seem to care about their properties or renters. This company is a complete and utter disappointment.
