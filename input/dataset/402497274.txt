I la-la-loveee the the pistachio and they even had a special Bailey's flavor that was delicious. Great place to sit and chitchat while eating gelato :) They also gave a generous amount when scooping!!They also have some flavors with no milk in it for those who are lactose intolerant :) Will definitely come back again.
