I went to Duckworth's for a quick meal one night and it was great! This was my first time there, and our server was super nice and friendly. We didn't have to wait long at all to get our food. I had the Carolina BBQ sandwich, and it was delicious! It was also reasonably priced. I really don't have any complaints and will definitely go back.
