Been in AZ for about 5 days now. Looking for a gym that's cardio intensive without weights and the generic things that I can do on my own. I currently work out 5-6 days/week, and was a varsity athlete in college. Went here for two reasons: 1) to learn about what the buzz is all about with CrossFit and 2) to find a home gym for the summer. My impression is that the community was a bit cult-ish, perhaps because the group was younger than myself. I've learned from talking to friends that this is the norm for CrossFit, in general. With that said, you couldn't pay me to do CrossFit (mainly b/c I have enough self-motivation and can do those things on my own. The group dynamic does nothing for me). However, I can understand how it may be a great fit for certain people. I'll continue my search for the right gym so look out for other reviews. But that's not why I rated it so low. If it doesn't float my boat, then that's okay. The rating comes from poor management and running of the location. I asked very specific questions and was hoping to learn about CrossFit -- before jumping into the actual workout. Once the running outside started (given that I'm from NY), I quit. I have no desire to faint in this heat. But the owner/manager would have known that I was new to the area (and it's beautiful yet atrocious weather/heat) -- had he conducted proper due diligence.
