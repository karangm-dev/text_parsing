Horrible service all around. I went in knowing what I was going to get right when it opened thinking it was going to be an in and out experience WRONG. I waited at the check out stand for 5 minutes before I realized that no one was going to come by anytime soon . I went to go look for an associate and guess who I found to be the cashier for that morning the same guy who made eye contact with me more then once while I was standing at the check out counter. SMH
