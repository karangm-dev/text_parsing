They received one star from me because you have to give a rating... zero would have been my choice.  The chicken was way overcooked and the nachos were bland. the cheese wasn't properly melted, the pico de gallo and guacamole had no flavor.  The burnt, boring, and overpriced food was only surpassed by the really bad service.  Our server was friendly enough, and having been in food service in the past, I'm pretty patient; however, she never returned to the table to check on our drinks or ask how the food was because we would have sent the chicken back.  And if any of the other servers are around don't bother asking for their assistance, and  don't even try to get the attention of a bus boy - who may just be cleaning the next table over.  After waiting a long while for our server to return so that my daughter could get a refill on her soda, she asked another server, who was just standing around chatting up another server.  Her response:  "Would you like me to get your waitress?"  Um, no, I'd like anyone to get me refill on a simple little soda...apparently too much to ask.  I know this is an airport restaurant, and Las Vegas of all airports, but c'mon!?  The bad food and "you're not my table" attitude was crazy.  On our return flight via Las Vegas, we bought Sbarro's.   The food was as we expected from Sbarro's, yet still better than Sammy's, for a lot less money, and with friendlier service.
