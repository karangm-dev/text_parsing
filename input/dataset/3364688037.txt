Nope, not happy. I agree that the desserts here taste great but when you have a special occasion to spend that kind of money on a cake, the easiest thing that should happen is writing the appropriate event. Someone must have thought it was funny to write "Happy Birthday" as "Nappy Birthday". You might think it was a small error, but it is obvious that it's a "N" and not a "H". It was just rude to recurve without someone double checking and more embarrassing to present. When I called about it, no one bothered to help me or return my calls. I wouldn't have even written a review if they just followed up with me, but they didn't so I'm just giving this as a fair warning to those that comes here. Your customer experience will be low at best and your presence is going to be unappreciated.
