We visited this past weekend. It took on hour to receive our meal and two of the dishes were cold. The waiter was bad but gave us free dessert to make up for the food and service. The peanut butter cup gelato was inedible. Tiny scoop of gelato with peanut butter slop on top. Not sure if the restaurant just had a staffing issue or what but we'd never go back.
