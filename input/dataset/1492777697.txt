I'm only giving them 2 stars because they have a lot of things to improve. 1st the register was so slow to take others. If i was the manager of this place i would have at least open the 2  registers since there was a lot of people making the drinks. && I don't get why the register person have to leave and go to the kitchen to give the ticket if someone orders food. Why can be somebody  take the order and have another person take the ticket to the kitchen so that the register can focus on taking orders. Plus i had to wait 45 mins for my popcorn chicken, seriously how long do you guys fry the effin chicken?
