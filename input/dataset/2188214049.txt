2 stars seems mean, but had we paid a bit less, I would have given 3.  I went with two friends and has a reservation on a Saturday night.  We waited 20 minutes (beyond reservation time) for a table. The service was fair.  My only specific complaint is that she brought the bill while I was eating (I'm slow).  The food was pretty good, overpriced, and definitely under-presented.  My friend had the ravioli... which was a plain bowl of pasta with sauce.  Another friend had the Franco salad, which seemed kinda busy.  I had the stuffed trout, which was very tasty, but (again) under presented.  Cafeteria plate.  No garnish.  Fish+stuffing.  The green beans were tasty because of the tbs of butter they were placed in.  All in all, it was ok, but over billed.  The restaurant is dated (70's chic?), the service was meh.  I didn't hate it, but everything was kinda 5/10- except the boss lady, who seemed to work her butt off.
