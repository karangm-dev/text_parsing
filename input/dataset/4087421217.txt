I have been coming here on a regular basis since they opened.  To be honest, it was a rough start.  The food has always been excellent, but the service was unbearable (stuffy and confusing given how many people were interrupting your dining experience).  Over the past year, they have nailed it.  The food continues to be incredible (glazed prawns with Mr. Chows hot sauce tops an awesome menu), but now they have the service to match it.  From the bartenders to the wait staff to the general managers, it is a friendly atmosphere that is attentive without being overbearing.  A great time once again!!!
