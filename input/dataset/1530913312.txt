So bad. We've given this place 2 tries. First was junction rd. the service was horrible and the food was mediocre. We did not like that we couldn't order our burgers to the temp of our liking. Tried the one in Verona. Again, horrible service and food was dry and disgusting. Dairy Queen has better burgers and quicker service! We will never be back unless it's for a beer.
