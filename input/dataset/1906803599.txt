Yeah this is a legit gelato spot.  5 stars and I never do that.  They have so many crazy food flavors that I've never seen before like sweet corn and gorgonzola cheese.  Who would have thought that that would even be worth eating but it is awesome.  The lady who was working the counter who I think is also the owner gave us a ton of samples and we weren't even asking for them.  I went with the passion fruit because I was looking for something sweet and tropical that evening.  It was great,.  Fantastic place and I would love to head back here for sure!
