This place is a rip off for the amount you pay to get in, and the exhibition is cool, but gets old really quick, if you use their hand held to go through the exhibitions and take pictures on it, you have to pay for the pictures at the end.  We bought some items at the end and spent about $80.00, we decided to return it the next day, they tell me that there is no return policy, but there are no signs at the cashier desk stating this, but only on the receipt, but who looks at the receipt until they get home. I would have saved money and had more fun staying home and watch paint dry
