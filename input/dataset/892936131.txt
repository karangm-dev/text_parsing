We went to the dealership on Monday, May 16th, to pick up our 2014 Rav4 from the service department, where we were having new tires and brakes put onto the car, as well as a couple other repairs. Over $2,300 overall.  From the second we arrived at the dealership, we were accosted by a couple of overzealous salesmen, who started talking out ears off about trading in our Rav for a brand new one, which we made clear we weren't going to do. Even when we made this clear, they still gave us their business card and talked our ears off some more. Turn the corner, and BAM! Another salesman, ANOTHER pitch to trade in our Rav. My mother and I were walking around, looking for bottled water, which this dealership has offered us before for free. We were directed towards a vending machine where you have to pay for it. Really? It's 100+ degrees outside and they don't even offer customers a complimentary water bottle to quench their thirst? Disappointed in Right Toyota. Their service used to be great, but it seems to be going more and more downhill with each continuous visit. If you can do so, the extra trek to Camelback Toyota may be worth it.
