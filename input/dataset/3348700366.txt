I came here after booking a truck to rent online the day before. I came on time and i saw the manager just sitting in the store like she was a customer. They had 7 trucks outside just sitting there. The girl told me that her system was down and budget had no trucks for rent in the hold city of charlotte. I did not receive a phone or email about this error. Any one that have moved before know how stressful moving can be and the last thing you want to think about is a rental truck. I had to call budget customer service for help because the manager did not care about my time . C.S told me to give the manager the phone and see if she could do a manual override she told them No! she does not have any paper. I left and went to u Haul and got a truck with no problem at all.  but was told it would be about 2 hours before someone call me where to get a truck so one of the manager of budget call me to give me a truck the truck was in a different city not even charlotte, I declined to drive almost 30 mins for a truck. Where i was driving too was already an 3 hours away .The most unprofessional business i been to in charlotte Nc by far.
