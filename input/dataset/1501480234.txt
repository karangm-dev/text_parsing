Little late on the review, but better late than never! My girlfriend and her family took me here on thanksgiving and we enjoyed everything!! This was my second time here and both of my experiences were amazing. You're greeted as soon as you walk in and we were seated immediately. Our server's name was Eric and he did an amazing job and maintained awesome service. He had a very positive attitude and made us feel welcomed. The first time I tried this place I was served by Tyler and he was great as well! Tyler and Eric are good. We ordered the truffle fries as an appetizer and I got the Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta. They give a good amount of fries and it was enough to satisfy the 5 of us. I really enjoyed my Cajun chicken and shrimp pasta as all the flavors blended really well. The portion is very generous. The main course options can range anywhere from $9-$30+ depending on what you order. This place is definitely affordable while upholding a fancy upscale vibe. Definitely will be back!
