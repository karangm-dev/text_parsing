Kenny is an amazing artist! He came highly recommended by a few people when I was asking around, as this being my first tattoo ever, I wanted to make sure I went to someone really great! Even though it wasn't a big piece, he still treated it like it mattered. It wasn't nearly as painful as I thought it would be and Kenny was so patient and he really cares/listens to what you want. He made the entire process effortless. I LOVE my tattoos! The Electrik Needle is a really cool space too. Very clean and private shop tucked away in Downtown Phoenix. I highly recommend him!Thank you Kenny!
