Came here for lunch and went with the buffet with my gal... and while they were very welcoming... the overall experience didn't quite live up to expectations. The staff was responsive with regards to clearing plates and delivering water, but the TV was up fairly loud and on what seemed like an action movie with a Bollywood level of violence which spoiled the atmosphere a bit, the food was meh with some dishes being cold that were meant to be served hot, and the decor was a bit run down.While I'm glad that there are new Indian places popping up in the area... there's a good amount of competition now... and this place should make some changes to stay competitive.
