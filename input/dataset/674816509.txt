The burger was really good, bought t that is where the good stops. It took about 30 mins to get my food and when I finally got the food, the fries were cold. I had to ask for the check from the bartender because my waitress was off talking on the phone in the corner. I also had to ask the bartender for a refill since my waitress was 'busy'.
