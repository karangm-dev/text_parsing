I took my daughter to see Dr Lederman in the Glendale office as she was needing a shoulder replacement. I was told he is the best. My daughter has multiple disabilities from a TBI. She only has the use of that one arm/shoulder. Of course the doctor knew her condition at the first appointment. He said she was too young for a replacement as they only last so long and wanted to put off the surgery. He suggested a series of  shots in the shoulder which did not relieve the pain. Then the next appointment with Dr Lederman a couple years later due to increasing pain, my daughter was sent to a pain clinic again saying she was too young for the surgery and rehab would be hard. Shots in the shoulder and neck did not relieve the pain. Then she was prescribed with pain meds. This went on another few years. She was crying in pain everyday and in the night too. I massaged her up to ten times a day and bought every pain topical solution I could find besides taking the pain meds. She cried and  "begged" me to cut off her arm several times. We finally went back to Lederman again. This time my daughter refused to take no for an answer...she wanted the surgery. Dr Lederman left the room and came back in saying "I'm not the man for job. Myself or my staff is not accustomed to working with someone with a TBI." Then he walked out. Like he did not already know her condition from day one. My daughter suffered terribly for these years of delaying the surgery then refusing to do it. He did refer us to another doctor who turned out to be a blessing with a very caring heart. Dr Dana Seltzer. The surgery WAS difficult and the rehab WAS difficult, but we got through it as a team and she is now pain free with most of her shoulder movement intact.
