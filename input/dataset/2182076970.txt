All I can say is that Paul and his team were so helpful! I was in a time crunch before my research conference and needed my poster printed by Thursday night. I called to submit my poster and they were swamped until I came in at 5pm. Paul and his associate stayed after 6 to print it for me and make sure that it was aligned correctly. I think the prices were more when compared to Kinkos or Staples, but  the craftsmanship and availability of my poster far surpassed the money that I saved!
