Used this company to cater a working lunch for my boss.  They bought 5 oz drink glasses and no ice!   Really?  This was a working lunch, not a bar crawl.  The sandwiches were average, at best.  Then the deliverer who set the lunch up left a large bag and several boxes right in the conference room.  You'd think for $200 they would have carried out their own garbage!  We will NOT be using this vendor again!  I would rate them and their service as mediocre at best and their delivery services as just bad!
