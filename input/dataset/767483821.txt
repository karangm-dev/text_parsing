I have been going to Gavin Scott for about a year and a half. I started going because I was so impressed with everything they do for non-profits in the community and I wanted to support a company that gives back. I keep going because my hair has never looked better. Anastasia does such a great job. Not a week goes by that I don't get compliments on my cut and color.
