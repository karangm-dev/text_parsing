I have lived in Phoenix since 1986 and this was my first time at the Original Pancake House.....if it's another 32 years before I'm back it'll be too soon. We had to wait 35 minutes for a table.  Then it took 40 minutes to get our food.  When I said something to Jessica, our server, she said "yeah its taking longer than usual"...... No apologies, nothing.  We said something to the cashier and she had already run our card so she gave us $6 from the register.  That was for our $41 bill for 2 people.  I'll never come back again.  Screw this place and screw Scottsdale!!
