This is my first time ordering and I'm really taking a chance by ordering a large quantity. I placed an order for the 100 piece assorted sushi, sashimi and rolls platter.  To my surprise I did not get 100 pieces.  There was only 97 pieces.  Do they skim a few pieces from every large platter order hoping their customers won't notice?  The sashimi is sliced too thinly and very small.  I'm disappointed that I did not get exactly what I ordered.  I'll go back to my tried and true sushi joints as Ai Sushi has left me with ill feelings of being ripped off, even if it is 3 missing pieces.
