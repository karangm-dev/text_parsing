By far THE best vegan place I've been to. I've been to multiple vegetarian and vegan restaurants in different states, and none come close to Green. I thought it'd be easier to find places like this in LA, but I can't find anything that compares! As for the menu, I've had every bowl, multiple appetizers, and one of the sandwiches (bbq mock chicken) and I have NEVER been disappointed! You're good with anything you order here. The tsoynami's are bomb too.Tip: Always ask for extra sauce when ordering bowls! They make them pretty dry, but they are AMAZING when there's enough sauce.
