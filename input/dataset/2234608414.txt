HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Just went into the the Chandler location and an employee named Francesca helped me, or should I say DIDN'T help me. She was so horrible. I was standing at the register for about 5 minutes and I had to go find her to check me out. I was using a gift card and the card wouldn't swipe. She said "there probably wasn't anything on there", so to prove her wrong I called the number on the back of the card and had the customer service representative give me the balance. The Rep said she needs to punch in the card number and Francesca said she wasn't allowed to punch it in, per her Manager. The Rep also tried to call the store and couldn't get through because the stores phone was busy, but Francesca said it was fine. I ended up just walking out extremely frustrated. I have been in other locations and they are always so helpful. I will NEVER be back to this location.
