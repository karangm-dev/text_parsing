Never again I just left after making a return on two VGK LEGO sets. They were both missing pieces. I called the company before making the return. It seems there was a packaging issue and yes they were missing pieces. One set was for me another set was to be a gift. I returned the gift purchases. The manager was curt and pissed off that I was making the return. He chucked the LEGO boxes across the counter causing LEGO pieces to go flying across the counter and slammed my refund on the counter instead of handing it to me like a normal cashier would. I've spent over $100 bucks in this store so far and almost bought a game sweater/jersey. They aren't getting another dime out of me never mind $170 for a game jersey. I'm sure it's been crazy this week in the store but this store is making a killing off us. Edit...I happily dropped $230 at the Arsenal after leaving this store.
