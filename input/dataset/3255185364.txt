This was our third stop on our tour of Zack Bruell restaurants.  We are new to the area and absolutely LOVE Chinato so we had to try Parallax. The atmosphere in the main dining room is modern. We were seated in the back room which has space heaters and much less to appreciate.   The staff were friendly and helpful.   Unfortunately, the meal was disappointing. We tried both the sushi and American items on the menu. The sushi was mediocre at best.  There was too much cilantro on the Hamachi which was not the freshest. The  crudo at Chinato is miles better.  The pork shank and  scallops were very good but with all the excellent restaurants in Tremont, I wouldn't say it's a must try.
