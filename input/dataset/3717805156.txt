Their hot dogs are the bomb! Super huge portions and they top of hot dogs a lot. I got the Angry and my boyfriend got the Hawaiian. Both were really delicious. The angry wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be but it had a nice kick. The Hawaiian wasn't overly sweet with the pineapples on top either, it was a good balance.I would definitely recommend this place though!
