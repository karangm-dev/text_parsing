I've been living in Las Vegas and went to about 4 hair salons trying to get blonde highlights in my hair and couldn't find someone to give me perfect highlights until I walked into Boulevard and got styled by Malia. I knew she would be amazing because she had amazing hair herself :) I've gone about 4 times to get highlights in my hair as well as a haircut (I usually fly back home to Miami to get a haircut) but now that I found Malia I don't trust anyone else with my hair! She's gives great consultations and has a great technique as to where I don't have any hair damage. She's a real asset to the business and the only reason I've gone back to this salon. She gives me great advice and delivers and exceeds her clients expectations, although she's young her passion and dedication to her profession shines through.
