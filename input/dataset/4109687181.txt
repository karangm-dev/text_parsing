This is so sub standard anymore! The saute dishes always lack flavor and never have any sauce to them! You surely lack culinary professionals and skills Olive Gardens! My recent visit was the Chicken and Shrimp Scampi(upcharge to do it was fine) but here it came out with asparagus and red onion in it and no fresh herbs, nor any dry herbs, and no sauce. I  could taste no wine, garlic, lemon, or butter! My wife had Chicken Parm with Fettuccini Alfredo, again, hardly any sauce to no sauce! The bread sticks have got to go. These were so salty that not even the wildlife would eat them. Its a wonder how this chain cant get their head out of their ass and do better! Try any other Italian restaurants unless you like sub standard food.
