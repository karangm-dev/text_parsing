I honestly love this location! Blanca is always so welcoming and friendly. Her personality definitely makes it a fun experience! Every time I come in my food is fresh or if I ask for it to be made fresh they will make it. We ordered the orange chicken and Kung pow chicken tonight and it was soooo yummy. I love coming back here because the staff makes me feel like I live in a small town where people know each other and say hi with a smile.
