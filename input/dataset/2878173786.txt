As we were coming into town very late, we were looking for a good, inexpensive place to stay. We read good reviews about this place. Yes, it was inexpensive and for a low price hotel, not too bad. Relatively clean, good beds. However, my WiFi never worked and our television would play for about 15 min then lose the signal. Breakfast was like a cattle drive and being a weekend, way too early. Arriving 20 min before close, the staff was already taking away pans of food but even worse, at 9:35 the staff stood at the door looking very annoyed at the 10 people searching for any type of food until someone called out"just shut off the lights" at which point we were left standing in the dark. A few people making waffles just left.  I get being ready to finish up your shift, but that just felt incredibly rude to me.  Would not go back.
