I've been to Upstream three times, spanning a period of around five years.  The first meal we had there was excellent -- service and food were unquestionably outstanding.Around a year later, we returned for another dinner and this time it was underwhelming.  The food was OK, but when you're spending $200+ for two people you expect an exceptional experience.Around a month ago, on the advice of a friend, I went for Sunday brunch.  It wasn't the first time I had heard about the great brunch there, so I was anticipating something special.We arrived around 12:30 and ordered a couple of mimosas.  What they served us was orange juice with a splash of champagne.  We began with a selection of small plates.  I was most excited about the crabcake benedict, but I needn't have been.  Aside from being ridiculously small (it was truly more of an amuse bouche) -- the dish was bereft of flavor.  French toast was similarly disappointing.So off to the buffet.  We should have checked its condition before we sat down.  It looked like a war zone.  Mid range hotel chains do a much better job of maintaining their buffets better than Upstream.  What was once a smoked salmon fillet was now a ravaged pile of flesh.  There were bits of food and trash around almost every station.  They were out of most of the premium items:  the salmon, crab legs and crab claws and sushi (which I probably wouldn't have eaten from a buffet anyway, but nevertheless...)  I ended up with an omelet -- it seemed safe, although expensive at $25.All in all a big disappointment.
