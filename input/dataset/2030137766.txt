Maybe I just don't get it, but the hype for these burgers is insane.  Beef must be treated with something that releases endorphins into the bloodstream that make people write crazy things.  These burgers are average at best.  The Galley Boy is covered in a sauce that, obviously, everyone loves, because the meat is almost tasteless.  I giggled when I read about how Swenson's was named "Best Burger in America" by Forbes magazine. After a little research, I found out that this title was given to them by a former Akronite, working for Forbes! There was no voting, no research, no taste testing, just one man's opinion.  Kind of how politicians spin every fact to their advantage. Anyway, try it for yourself. If you love it , good for you. I'm just not impressed at all.
