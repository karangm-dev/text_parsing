Came here on vacation with family, this place has lovely seating, very unique. You can watch the chefs making your noodles! I haven't had beef brisket noodle since I was a kid and it's one of my favorite meals, was lucky they serve them here. We also had the bubble tea with pudding crab and regular dumplings and some pancakes rolls. Hand made noodles taste the best~ Will come back again for more gourmet soon~
