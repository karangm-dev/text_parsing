Not the best atmosphere, We finished our meals and had to remind them we had ordered appetizers. The Waitress came out with all kinds of stories of how the kitchen keeps screwing things up- then what I believe was the shift manager comes out and starts talking about how shipments are often messed up and corporate this and that. Neither paint a good picture for the place.  As far as the food- it was decent. Until I ordered an extra fish filet after asking if the fish fry on friday was all you can eat or not - The waitress said yes- then I was billed an extra $5 and the menu prices were also no what we were billed on our tab. Not really happy with the place at all.
