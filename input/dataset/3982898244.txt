1. I can hardly ever get into classes here. They book up so fast, like literally within 2 minutes of their opening. I have a busy schedule, I really don't have time for waitlisting and suddenly getting into a class when I've planned something else. 2. The actual workout... what is the point of all that bouncing around on the bike? And pushups on the bike?? Seems goofy and pointless. The weights are pointless too. I have done many spinning classes that don't do all that nonsense and felt like I got a far better (and safer) workout and that actually feel more like real cycling.3. I signed up for a package with my running group and if you can't get into the Monday class they give you other classes you can go to. Usually, they are at times when no normal working person can go. 4. What I do like. I like that they give you a towel. Haha seriously that's it for me. Overall there's really nothing special about this place that makes it stand out to me. I actually dread going. The parking is awful (but that's just Cleveland, not on this business), the cubby space for clothes etc is tiny and super congested... Maybe I'm spoiled by a fantastic instructor elsewhere, but I think I'm done trying to go here.
