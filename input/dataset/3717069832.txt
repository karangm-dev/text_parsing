OVERVIEW: I've been here 5 times with my friends from opening night through just 2 weeks ago and we all have yet to have a good time here.  Phoenix is in desperate need for a great gay dance bar.  Year after year Charlie's, a gay country western bar, wins "Best Dance Bar".  Unfortunately, Club Forbidden is apparently not up to the challenge - blown speakers, inconsistent drinks, poor parking, & a typically bitchy crowd makes this IKEA/Trading Spaces remake of a classic scottsdale dive bar, not worth the effort.MUSIC: Blown speakers when you first walk in the main entrance is the perfect indication of what you're in for: the music is always too loud.  What's worse is there is no place to get away from it and socialize with your friends unless you can handle choking on thick cigarette smoke on the small, noisy, overly crowded, parking lot patio.As mentioned in other reviews, the main room's DJ plays an iPod Shuffle style mixture of Top 40s music from the past 25 years with no logical flow.  The music in the smaller electronica room is much better and is more likely to instill that "OMG, I this mix is awesome, I want it!" emotion we have all experienced going to a great nightclub.  Unfortunately, like the main room, the music is too loud to enjoy here as well and ears are ringing after just a few moments.DRINKS: Drinks range from weak to mediocre.  Typically my drinks were barely 1 shot for an Absolut and Redbull served in a large glass.  I felt waterlogged before I could feel the slightest buzz.BOTTOM LINE: My friends and I REALLY want to like this bar (that's why we've gone back 4 more times) but it just can't compare to how good the late Boom and the late Crowbar (now DWNTWN) were.
