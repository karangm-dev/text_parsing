Becoming one of my favorites!  The service is great, and the Chef comes out to meet you personally.  My family and I eat here at least once a week and maybe more.  My favorite is the Korean BBQ plate and Panang Salmon.  Small little hole in the wall restaurant, maybe hidden, but very much worth finding.  This food here is top notch, off the hook, awesome.
