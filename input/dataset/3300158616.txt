My friends and I are regulars. The restaurant manager is very accommodating and the service is great. One of the best Chinese restaurants in Toronto. The food is diligently made and so fine, unlike in other restaurants that seem too commercialized. My favourite would be the glutinous rice stuffed chicken! This place is definitely worth going back!
