Customer service is the worst for any company I have every dealt with.  Walk in, I asked the guy with the black beard and hair, about 30 years old, hey, how are you doing? He responded, not good but you don't care anyway. Oh, ok I responded hope your day gets better. He responded it won't, how can I help you? I should have walked out then. I was explaining the issue I was having with the parts I had with me and before I could finish, he took them out of my hand and after trying to tell him many times what the issue was, I finally just waited for him to finish. Finally, I took the parts back and said, let me explain, you are putting them together incorrectly and continued to explain the issue. He said, I am not going to agriculture with you but you are wrong.  He asked another lady to look at it, short hair, perhaps the manager, she yells across the room, what is this part for? I said it from my shower. She replied in a very snotty voice, I am asking you what Parton the shower is this? Another customer turned to look at me in surprise and amazement that I would be yelled at in such a manner.  I will never go back there again. This was my second time and the first time I received awful customer service. I figured it was just a bad day. Stay away from this company!
