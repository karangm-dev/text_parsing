Fast and efficient.  THe shuttle was quick to take us to the destination.  I was surprised at how far the rental car place is from the airport but we got there quickly.  The shuttle on the way back to the airport was quick as well.  We rented through Budget and were in and out within about 10 minutes.  The return process was a breeze.
