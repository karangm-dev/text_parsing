Great food and a great atmosphere. We were visiting Vegas from the Phoenix-area and were looking for a place that was a little different. And we found it!The filet was good.  Portions may be a little small for some. If you are hungry, you may want to invest in some appetizers or sides. Or, better yet, get some dessert. We paired the triple layer chocolate cake with a scoop of the sea salt caramel ice cream, per a recommendation from our waitress. It was an excellent choice.The restaurant is a little distance from the Strip, which is good or bad depending on what you are looking for. We did run into A LOT of traffic trying to get back to the strip. Luckily we planned lots of time before our show. I definitely recommend Honey Salt for something a little different in Vegas.
