This is one of my favorite shops in the entire city. Bohemian jewelry, clothing, and knickknacks galore!When in South Side, no matter what I'm down there for, I make it a point to stop in. Even just browsing is a real treat!There is everything from a wall of various types of incense to a room of billowy patterned and tie-dyed dresses and skirts. Balls of hemp string, elephant adorned handbags, and paper lanterns also line the shelves, walls, and ceiling. My personal favorite though is the broad selection of ornate gem jewelry, which, to be honest, is the main reason I pop in. From the flashy labradorite and moonstone to the swirly bumblebee jasper and agate, there is serious eye candy to be feasted on. It's the first room you walk in to, and you can spend an hour in there, EASY.I've introduced so many people to the charms of this shop. I hope they're there for years and years to come.
