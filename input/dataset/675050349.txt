I love the Birkdale Village. The shopping, the restaurants, the watering holes. This place is so great. It is all decked out for the holidays and feeling as festive as ever. It will take you all day to parooz through all the fun shops. The White and Black boutique is one my favorites but the "Naner" - aka Banana Republic is up there too. I polished off my Saturday shopping extravaganza with a much deserved Cafe Latte from Starbucks as I sat and people watched. The Birk, makes me feel like I stepped into a Norman Rockwell Painting (only with crazy traffic). I haven't felt much in the spirit of the holidays this year because everything feels rushed but something came over me as I watched the little kiddies delight at the ginormous Christmas Tree. It was a good day and just what I needed to get out of the Grinch funk I was in.
