Being a Mexican I love me some tequila and mezcal and margaritas. I've seen cien agaves on my yelp a few times so after the crushbrew fest this spot was walking distance I figured it was the right time. The place is small and super cool with all the decorations and paintings on the walls it definitely catches your eyes so I was stoked to try the food and drinks. The salsas are bomb specially the Red ill give that 5 stars. The food I was disappointed big time. The carnitas were dry and were not carnitas they were more of a machaca dried shredded beef and was way salty. The beans and rice were ok. The drinks again disappointed the margaritas were very sour and watered down,no wayyyyy these are the best or even close. The service was good, amy was friendly and did a great job but, food wise and drinks they were below standards. I think just because they are in old town they have a good rep but there's a lot better and more authentic Mexican food and drinks in 90 percent of phx or scottsdale and cheaper. A lot of hype and not enough substance.
