I am not sure why I have returned here, given every experience has been a bad one. I'm not even sure where to start with the complaints! First off, my boy is now 6 1/2. I had heard of this place prior to even having a child. These kids grow like weeds, so I figure it nice to get a small return back on purchases that arnt usable anymore because they have outgrown it. And when I say small return, that's exactly what you will get here. I have actually been offended by some of their prices on items I have turned in. Case in point, this past weekend, I brought in a large ikea bag stuffed full of both my sons stuff and stuff I no longer wanted (they take children & womens clothing). After a 4 hour delay in them going through it and pricing it, they took approximately 10 items, one of them being a pair of coach sneakers. Used, but still. And guess what I was given. 5 BUCKS! Talk about a slap in the face. That's probably what I paid in gas to drive from downtown to up there to drop the bag off. I don't think I've ever had a pleasant experience here. I have never bought from them, only traded in and taken cash instead of credit towards purchases. EXAMPLE. If they sell the item for 10 dollars, you will get either 5 in store credit or 2.50 in cash. Pathetic right? Whats even more pathetic is that hardly anything in the store even costs 10 bucks. So you really are getting pennies back. I have 2 suggestions. First, go to Hissyfit's before coming here. They are pickier on what they take, but they pay WAY better. And second, I would suggest only coming here if you have an infant and intend on trading in old items and purchasing new stuff with them. The cash value just isn't worth the time and effort to bring stuff in.
