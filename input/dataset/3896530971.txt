We had an awesome experience with Ocean Furniture!My girlfriend and I were in need of a new couch, and after a bit of searching I found Ocean here on Yelp. Based on the other reviews, we decided to visit the store we're very happy we did. Ken is the owner of the business and we really enjoyed working with him. He listened to what we were looking for and had a great selection for us to choose from.We ended up purchasing a nice sectional and, as part of a promotion, Ken offered us a great 3 piece coffee/end table set. When the furniture was delivered, Ken and his crew setup our furniture quickly and made sure we were happy with our configuration. I'd also like to note that one of the end tables had a small defect on it, which Ken brought to our attention before he even unloaded the truck. I was even more impressed with Ken's service when he worked with his supplier and got us a replacement table top under warranty and came to replace it a few days later.We've had the furniture for about a month and a half and we couldn't be happier with our purchase. Thanks Ken!
