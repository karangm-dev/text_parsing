Disclaimer: I'm pretty easy to please. $30 for possibly the worst lemon chicken I've ever had (tasteless) and house special soup with an oddly sweet tomato broth. The sesame chicken was passable due to decent sauce. Husband had a soft drink. Maybe the noodle dishes are better. Chicken appears to be cooked from frozen. Friendly service though.
