I can't believe there are so many good reviews for this dealer. Stopping here was the worst 20 minutes I have ever wasted, while shopping for a car. Here is exactly how my experience went: 1. Parked car, opened door. 2. Salesguy was already standing outside of my car door. 3. He asked my name, before I had shut my door. 4. Before asking anything truly relevant, such as 'What are you looking for today', this man asked what I owed on my current vehicle (before asking if I was going to trade it in) and what kind of down payment I was prepared to make that day. Um... really? 5. When I asked the price of the first vehicle that appeared to fit my requirements, he said he didn't know. My husband asked the price of the SUV next to it; he didn't know. He suggested that maybe he could go inside and get the prices for us. Um... hey, there's a thought. He left us standing there, in the heat, no shade. 6. We looked for shade while waiting; the little there was already was full of the remaining salesmen milling about (not one other shopper on the lot... gee, surprising) and not one acknowledged our presence... within 25 feet of them. 7. We waited for nearly five minutes for our gy to return, then started to get back into our car. It was too hot, and there were too many other lots to waste this kind of time on one that wasn't prepared to do business. 8. Mr. Pushy & Rude comes running out, yelling, hey I got the price on one car and am trying to get the other. Yeah... no. We'll pass. Kiss our asses and money goodbye. Good grief!
