These guys are the real deal! After calling about 10 different paint contractors, some of which wouldn't even return my phone call, these guys went above and beyond through the entire experience. They came out the very next day to give me an estimate. The estimate was fair and reasonable compared to the others I was getting. They painted my brand new 2300 sq foot home in 1 day!!! Yes, 1 day that is not a typo. All the other guys said 2-4 days. My husband and I are very meticulous and we only found 1 spot in the whole house we wanted them to touch up and it was super minor. These guys are great, professional and clean up after themselves. I will use them over and over again and will refer them to all our friends and family. Highly recommend these guys!
