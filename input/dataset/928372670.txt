Let me start off by saying that I have the BIGGEST sweet tooth, and have wanted to check off the melting chocolate balls off my bucket list for a long time now, so you can imagine how excited I was to go to this place! My friend and I came on a Saturday night and shared the C'Wow (which is a chocolate dome that melts when you pour hot caramel on top of it, revealing ice cream, a liege waffle, and brownie bits). Although there wasn't that much food on the plate, boy was it filling! A great dessert to share, especially since it is a little on the pricier side at $17, but a really cool experience! Also noteworthy is the service - the staff were all super friendly and the food came out quick. I would DEFINITELY recommend this place to anyone, and would come back again to try out everything else on the menu!
