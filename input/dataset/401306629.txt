It's nice to take the time to celebrate the amazing events Nikki has brought us over this past year with yet another great event.Pinky's new location is nicely set up with a patio, tvs at the bar and a great overall space. The food was great and well Sierra Nevada and Sailor Jerrys supplied us with awesome beverages, I couldnt help but notice the great drink specials Pinky's had posted for each night of the week. Reflect back on this past year, everyone must see what an over achiever Nikki is. (and I mean that as a compliment.) Charlotte has lucked out with some of the best community managers I can imagine are out there but some how Nikki has found the time and the means to take it to a whole new level.Seems like the typical monthly event has turned into two and the annual Yelper's party has turned into the semi-annual Yelper party. There are also great monthly CMYE which allows me the opportunity to give my friends a small taste of what being Yelp elite means.Each event brings a new experience with new friends. So thank you Nikki for raising a bar that no one new could be raised!
