Horrible experience. I went in for what I thought was a kidney infection. Although i had tender kidneys and bladder, i was diagnosed with a uti because "i didn't look sick enough". Doctor came in chewing, as if I was interrupting her lunch, and spent less then 5 minutes with me. I asked her if I had a fever as i was leaving and her response was "I don't know. Did you have one at home?". I will NEVER go back to this place.
