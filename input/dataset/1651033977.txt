Be prepared for an authentically wonderful meal.  The owner took the time to walk us through the menu and helped us with selections while sharing information on his beloved Belizean culture.  The watermelon drink, stewed chicken and bread pudding were just amazing!  Great flavors that I will definitely come back for.
