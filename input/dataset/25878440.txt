Yikes - this place is horrid.  I booked it for dinner before LOVE at the Mirage based on the reviews here and was very disappointed.  I wasn't too familiar with the Mirage restos from previous trips so I kind of went in blind.The website says that it was voted "Best Italian Restaurant" by the Las Vegas Concierge Association.  Onda is supposed to offer classic-rustic Italian cuisine with American innovations.What we found it offered was cafeteria quality Italian food with crappy service.It's incredibly loud and hard to hear considering the look of the place, but it was probably made worst by this woman with a super screechy voice who was having a b-day dinner that night.The restaurant was packed but we were seated quickly at the back in a room with a softer, romantic type decor.  It took forever to get the menus, and forever to get pretty much anything else in this place from the food to the bill.  Needless to say, we had to skip dessert to make it to LOVE on time.I had the leek soup to start and my husband had the Ceasar salad.  Both were okay... nothing amazing.  We were both craving nice Italian pasta so he ordered the lasagna and I had the sweet pea ravioli.  Mine was pretty gross, with the pea filling done in such a way that it clumps in your mouth in a nasty way and leaves this horrid after-taste.The lasagna was okay, but really reminded us of cafeteria type lasagna that you get at work or at school... neither of these pastas were worth the $25ish that they wanted.Trust me, Onda is definitely skippable.  I don't know if we were here on a bad night, but this is the worst meal I've had in Vegas.
