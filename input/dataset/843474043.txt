This place is bull, I have a friend the just had a party for her husbands 40th, top golf just screwed her. The management is not very cooperative. They have the worst customer service, took all the food and drink chips 1/2 hour before the party ended. Our party of over 20 people will never have a party here. Will go somewhere else.
