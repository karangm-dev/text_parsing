Professional, honest, fair pricing, and dependable.  I don't know about the rest of the yelp viewers out there but these are the most important traits I look for when doing business.  Carpet Monkey of Las Vegas delivered all of them in spades ( pardon the play on Las Vegas and spades   ). They were prompt and extremely professional, the owner was incredibly concerned with whether or whether not I was happy with his service. Just for the record I was extremely pleased. I am almost embarrassed to say what a difference they made on my tiles.  Night and day.  I've been in my house for 10 years regularly have it cleaned however I've never had my tiles steamed and chemically cleaned like they performed and what a difference, I'm so happy.  I just happen to find them via reading some reviews on yelp and thought that I'd give them a shot I am so glad I found them.  So if you're riding the fence on whether or whether not to give him a shot all I can say is I would pull the trigger and call them again in a heartbeat.  They will be my only go to carpet and tile guys from now on.
