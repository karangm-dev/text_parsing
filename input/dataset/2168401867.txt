The staff was nice, especially the van driver to and from the airport. This review doesn't reflect negatively on the staff. I would like to make that clear since I'm in customer service myself and some things really are out of the control of those working the "front lines." 1.) the hot water in my room didn't work at all. Taking a cold shower in a hotel room should never be something that happens, ever! 2.) the heat in the room never worked either. I'm the type of person that sleeps with fans on me and keeps the room cold cause I like to cuddle up with a lot of blankets. Well, it's winter in Cleveland and I'm not at home with my said many blankets so I expect the heat to work in a hotel room. 3.) the workout room is a joke. The two core workout balls were deflated. The Sanitizer wipes to wipe down equipment before and after use were out. The room was hot. The room was extremely small. Limited equipment. In all, I am not happy with my stay and I would suggest spending your money elsewhere. I think a red roof would at least give you a hot shower!
