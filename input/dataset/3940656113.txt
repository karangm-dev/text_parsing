I visited the T-Mobile to see Queen.  Like most have posted on Yelp regarding the disorganization of the entry process, it was truly chaotic.  On the tickets, it noted that the doors were to open at 7:00 p.m.  It took them a full 15 - 20 minutes after 7:00 p.m. to open the doors - and we waited in 117 degree heat outside!  Once the lines started to move, there were security personnel missing from specific metal detectors so we all had to merge into other lines...  not well planned out at all.  Bottles of water are pricey within the venue - $5 for Desani.
