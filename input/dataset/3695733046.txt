AMAZING savory pies!!!  The green chili gringo hand pie is RIDICULOUS.  Perfect flakey crust, just the right amount of filling of Pork Green Chili, Eggs, Potatoes and Cheddar- great on the go breakfast!  I also tried the 5" Pork Green Chili POT PIE, which of course was wonderful.  We need one more pizza and/or desert shop across the street and we can officially call this stretch of Coronado bordering 7th street: THE PIE DISTRICT.
