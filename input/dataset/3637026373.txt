My family and I live eating at Olive Garden. We love their food. This review is specifically for the location next to the superstition springs mall. The staff at this place is some of the rudest and impolite people in the business. Smiling and happy servers, waiters make for a happy eating out experience. And if a happy eating out experience is what you are looking for then do yourself a favor and go some place else. The peopl here don't care about the customer. They just to you eat , leave them a tip and get the hell out there to make room for the next set of fools.
