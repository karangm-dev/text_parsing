we went to pick up lunch and I happily sat down to eat the L12 (orange chicken). having started eating my chicken I noticed there was a couple hard pieces so I spit out my check to see what it was... lo and behold there were bones. Not one bone but three. I didn't say anything because I didn't feel like arguing with the manager. Every other time I have been to this restaurant I have never had a problem until today. I'm just very disgusted that they don't check for bones. you have just lost a customer.
