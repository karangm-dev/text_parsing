OMG! Eggslut's food is amazing!!! We had the Gaucho and Slut, and they were so delicious!! Gaucho is made out of tender and juicy wagyu beef, with arugula. The Slut is so creative, with egg and potato puree, self-spread on baked crispy bread. I love it that they're open 24 hours. We had no line at 3 am in the morning (duh lol). Such good comfort and breakfast food!
