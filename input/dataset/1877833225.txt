Ana! Very knowledgeable and informative chick plus she did an amazing job on switching my piercing due to a horrid infection. She gave me great advice on the healing process and now, 3 weeks later, my piercings are completely normal and feeling/looking as great as ever! I'm ditching my older piercer and only trust Ana for piercing advice and new piercings if I ever deiced to get another. If you ever have problems with any body/ear piercings I would always and forever now recommend Ana!
