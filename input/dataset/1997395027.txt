Not about taste, as my To Go order was very tasty.  I ordered 2 scrambled eggs, subbed pork sausage for chicken apple sausage, didn't get the toast, and hash browns ... $15!!! Are you KIDDING me???? Do you realize how many other places a person can go for eggs and sausage for half the price?? And there was only 1 sausage link! There was nothing fancy or special about it. Sorry, Matt's ... not paying $15 again.
