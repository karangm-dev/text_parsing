I have been a loyal Cox customer for 15-20 years. I have cable ( a big pckg.), telephone, and internet. My bill runs $300/mo. so over my time w/them they have certainly made at least $50,000.00.BUT THEY TREAT MY LIKE TRASH.They sent a tech here last week who was aggressive, scary, threatening, and he refused to replace a DVR box that not only wasn't functioning, but had been "red flagged" for all customers b/c Cox knew they were defective and didn't work. He then left with my garage wide open, my phone box ripped apart, my cable boxes all over the house and my custom cabinets empty. It took 2 hours on hold and being passed around by Cox--just to get his employee i.d. to lodge a complaint.I lodged the complaint last week. I was told by Cox corporate a manager would get back to me immediately. No one has called or made any contact w/ me.I have now been told by another tech--who came to switch out the defective box yesterday--that the tech I had has "Lots of complaints". If Cox knows they have a dangerous employees out there terrorizing their customers, and damaging their cabinets and systems, why do they try so hard to protect them? It shouldn't take 2 hours on the phone to get the name ( or i.d. number) of who they send to your home. My attempts to talk to management about the issue have gone nowhere.And as I stated at the beginning, I am a large customer--a big account. Just imagine how they treat small accounts.
