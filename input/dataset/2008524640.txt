This was my first visit to Bertha's. I will definitely be returning... possible tomorrow to try their breakfast. We had the roasted turkey sandwich & the grilled asparagus with roasted chicken sandwich. Both are amazing!! Everything is so fresh. It's a cute little deli kinda tucked away in the corner. If you didn't know about it you probably wouldn't know it was there.
