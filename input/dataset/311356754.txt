This is a sales review: We came for the tour and the sales rep was insistent on receiving our social security numbers. At the casino we were told to just listen to the 120 min presentation and you will receive free gifts. I have been on timeshare tours before and was never forced to provide a SS #. The sales rep was very persistent even after we told her no, no, no from the minute we sat down. As a result we received our entire deposit back plus the ATM fee and 2 coupons to a restaurant at the Flamingo. The worst sales experience and waste of a day!!
