Had a Groupon for gel mani. Arrived 10 minutes late at 5:10 and nail tech was with client. Was told 20 minute wait and offered morning appointment the next day. I live 20 minutes away and this was on my way home from work and it's Friday so no. I waited 20 minutes because I was late myself. She was still with client so i asked front desk what time the clients appointment started. 4:15 "because her shellac wouldn't come off". Nail tech was unapologetic. Would have appreciated the. courtesy of a phone call letting me know she was running behind. So unprofessional and rude. Won't be back.
