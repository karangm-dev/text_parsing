Do not go here..definitely a scam artist. I brought my car there because they had free towing. The repair cost me $500, and they told me that my breaks needed fixing and that would cost an additional 500. I denied the breaks for now because I couldn't afford it. When I left my rear lights weren't working which wasn't a problem before so I brought it back. This time they told me my breaks would only cost 60...hmmm. They got the lights working, but the next day they were out again. I brought it to a different repair service and they told me they circuited the fuses wrong, but so they would appear to work temporarily. Waste of my time and money.
