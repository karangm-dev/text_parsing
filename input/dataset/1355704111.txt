Wow! I went here for a lunch date with my husband about a month ago and it was such a treat! It was a pricy dim sum experience, but well worth it.  The stand out item for us was the pork soup dumplings.  I still drool just thinking about that delicious broth.  We ended up ordering a couple more servings of it.  We also enjoyed sharing the Luckee Duck- a beautiful combination of flavours and textures.The service and decor was lovely- as you should expect from a nice/expensive place,  and the atmosphere had a nice laid back vibe.  Overall a great date experience where the food is the star.
