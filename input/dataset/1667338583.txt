My wife and I went into the White Cup Coffee shop this morning.  She had a dentist appointment  just around the corner.  So after that  we were looking for a place to have  breakfast.  Being from the Prescott  area we were not familiar with the area. So we turned to YELP.  The reviews were good so we thought why not try it ourselves. .  It was SUPER.  GREAT  atmosphere.  Small place but everything was great.  I had the VEGGIE  OMELET , HASH BROWNS , SOURDOUGH TOAST.  Excellent meal.  My wife hade EGG AND CHEESE  SCRAMBLE  with a side of BACON.  With SOURDOUGH  TOAST.  She had coffee and I had iced tea. The portions where just right.  Price was even better.  The lady that runs the place was just the nicest person.  Oh yeah the RASPBERRY JELLY  was great also.  AND yes we will definitely go back next time we have to visit the dentist  or happen to be in the area.
