This place is always busy until night, and the menu was very simple to choose. I can count on freshness and speed of services. Im satisfied with a double-double, french fries and a cup of soda. From a soft top, grilled hamburger bun, cheese, crispy lettuce, sliced tomatoes, and onions; all I taste and see are fresh ingredients. This is my fav fast food place in Vegas!
