I have gone to the website 4 times now trying to buy - weekend general admission tickets $125.00 for the 4th time and it does not allow it. I have sent email message about the problem. I called 644-4444, left a message to call me and a girl did call. I explained to her the problem and she said she would have someone look into it and fix it. That was 10 days ago and still not fixed. What is up??? Do you not need the sales??
