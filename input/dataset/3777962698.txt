Incredible stay here at The Platinum. Excellent service from the moment we walked in!Jasmine checked us in and was friendly and so helpful. Our Princess Suite on the 17th floor was spectacular! Super roomy and perfect for our stay. Not to mention the *AMAZING* Jacuzzi tub. I recommend a trip down to Lush (not too far... at the Grand Bazaar shops outside of Bally's) to grab a couple of bath bombs and bubble bars and take advantage.I bought a bath bomb from the hotel spa that I didn't love.. although it was SUPER adorable and shaped like a cupcake, it just wasn't as good as the stuff at Lush :)Hotel was a short cab ride to XS at the Wynn ($10 each way) and super conveniently located right around the corner from Ellis Island which, although it's a total local/divey spot, is one of my favorite places in LV.If you don't mind the heat, the Platinum is definitely walking distance to the strip. If you're more like me and want to drive everywhere, valet services are attentive and quick.I DEFINITELY recommend the Platinum if you're in the mood for a smaller hotel in Vegas! It doesn't have a casino or any type of performance spaces, but it's honestly amazing. CANNOT WAIT TO COME BACK!
