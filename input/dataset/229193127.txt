Just so everyone knows, I witnessed the older lady with the blonde ponytail that works in the kitchen drop my sandwich on the floor, pick it up, put it back on the cutting board and wrap it up to give it to me! I literally lost my shit as I demanded for the manager who was a dumb ass and looked at me like I was the problem. This place is ghetto, the neighborhood is ghetto and the people that work here are also ghetto. You want decent dunkin donuts go to the one on route 51.
