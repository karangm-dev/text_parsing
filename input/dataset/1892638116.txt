Today was not good...scheduled an appointment in person with the receptionist...or so I thought. Go in..the appt was not with the person I always see but with someone else. I schedule appts for a reason. Mgmt wants to apologize but this is their 2nd mishap with appts....okay I'll roll with it..while waiting for my daughter, an appt for my person is cancelled....do you think ANYONE had the thought of getting me in after all instead of making me come back another day?? That would be a NO . Seriously people....I know you are popular and typically very good BUT you need to treat all your customers as if they are your only one....do you want repeat business? I have referred lots of people and have been going for years ...not feeling very important at this point...apologies don't make up for it. Actions speak louder than words and you showed me today that I don't matter as your customer...you have 5 more people coming in the door and will still make the money...too bad it seems that's all that matters. Nothing offered to compensate in any way...definitely giving thought to what else is out there....disappointed!
