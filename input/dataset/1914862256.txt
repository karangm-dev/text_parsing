Lisa is always very professional and accommodating. My dog loves her and everything is always perfect when I get back. I had used someone else I found on Yelp before Lisa and would get back from a trip and my dog would need to be taken out immediately and would poop three times before coming back inside. Not the case with Pick of the Litter! I can tell my dog has been well walked and loved on while I was gone. It's nice being able to leave knowing my fur baby is ok. Lol!
