Called to see what time this place was open till since there were different times listed on Yelp and Google. Was put on hold 3 times before I could even ask my question.Once the girl finally came to the phone, she confirmed they were open till 7:00pm. I asked if the online price was for all breeds as I have a very large dog. She gave me a different price than what is listed online. When I asked if they would honor the online price she said, "umm no, probably not, the price changed the first of the year."I continued to tell her that the company is advertising a price on their website, she interrupted me to say that she doesn't control the website. Here is my issue, if you advertise something then honor it! If not then it appears to be a bait and switch scheme. Let me show one price to get you in the door and then charge more once you are here. Not the type of place I want to do business with. Sorry, the lack of customer service has lost a customer.
