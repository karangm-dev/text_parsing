Finally a place like this in Charlotte!!!!! They have combined a butcher shop and casual dining place with very upscale dishes on the same place. Their wine list is extensive and very well selected. It is your one stop shop for making a great meal at home  for a special occasion or bring the special occasion to here! The portions, quality of food, and atmosphere can't be beaten. Good place for business meetings, special occasions, casual lunch and have fun with friends.
