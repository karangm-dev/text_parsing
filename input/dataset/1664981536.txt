Last Sat March 28th on my first trip to Mesa AZ my roommate and I discovered this place called Margarita's Grill. The first thing I have to comment on was the excepetional service we got from the manager/bartender Aaron. Everything he suggested was spot on. For appitizers we had peppers stuffed with shrimp wraped with bacon. For drinks it was cadilliac margaritas. The staff was friendly  and proffesional.I was in AZ for spring training baseball. When I come back next year I will make sure to come back again.Nice job Aaron
