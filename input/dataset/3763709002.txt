OK, who ever makes the bagels in this joint, 5 stars to you're great bagel making ability. The everything bagels were on point. If I'm around Huntersville again, I might stop in for the bagels. However, the reason for my lackluster score is literally EVERYTHING ELSE. I wanted to get a good sample of the place, so we ordered bagel with butter, bacon egg & cheese, and a Reuben. Only thing I'd eat again was the bagel. The main cooking appliance for cooking in this joint in the microwave, eggs included. Nasty!! There is no flat top to be seen! I've never been to any NY deli serving hot food without a grill or flat top. Another reason I will hesitate to come back is the staff. Very loud, rude, pretty much the customers were an interference with whatever they were talking about. I'm all for camaraderie, but this was just obnoxious. Great everything bagel is the only reason for not getting 1 star. Poppyseeds Bagel is still the #1 bagel deli in the Charlotte area by far.
