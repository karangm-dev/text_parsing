Wonderful SE/E Asian style sandwich/breakfast shop with its Malay owner's DNA baked in. She's mostly nailed the street food/hawker center interpretations of the western sandwich (WTF sandwiches as we used to refer to them in Korea). The only disappointment was the kaya toast. It didn't seem to have the familiar pandan flavor you'll find in Singaporean kaya joints like Ya Kun. So, yeah, alas, if you're looking for Singaporean style kaya toast, you won't find it here. But you will find other good stuff.It's not a big place, seems to be constantly hopping, but these are not meals people linger over. Eat and get out. Wait probably won't be long.
