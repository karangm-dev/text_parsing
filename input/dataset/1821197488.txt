The concept is a good idea, the execution makes me think that the management has already given up. One of our party had the Oysters Rockefeller, the oysters were not fully cooked. My sweetheart had the Shrimp and grits, it was greasy enough to be inedible. We think that our waiter may have been stoned. I'm a musician, but I felt that the restaurant was way too loud.Let's see, what can I say positive? It's conveniently located and the d√©cor is pleasant enough. There are plenty of other places to go for dinner, seek them out.
