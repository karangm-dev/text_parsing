2 stars because the snacks and bubble were pretty good. The service was horrible. The server barely listened to my order bringing out what she thought I said. I even pointed out what I wanted on the Menu but flew right over the servers head. The rice they served was pretty soggy, but that might just be subjective. This wasn't the first time I've come here and received bad service. This place can be pretty inconsistent with the quality Of their beverages as well.
