I love this place and I am a regular. I went today and it was the busiest I have ever seen it, must be because of the holidays. The wait was longer than usual but the staff kept me me updated and was very apologetic. I was seated as quickly as the waiters could move,and they move fast. It seemed hectic but my order was taken swiftly and the food, as always, was delicious. I am never disappointed when I go and this being my first Yelp review of Pho Thanh, I want to let you know that everything on the menu is good. I also want to say that if it is busy, all you need is a little patience and it will be worth the wait.
