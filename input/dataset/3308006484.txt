Worst experience ever they don't check in till 4pm the literally wait till after 4 and just make excuses they rugs and getting shampoo then that they need inspections I can't believe it have tons of families waiting in the room and they can't call so see what the hell these house keepers are doing then it's 4 pm and now they say it won't be till 5 pm I'm furious. And will be calling corporate finally got in and smells like cigarettes!
