I take my dog here whenever my mom can't watch her, they do a lovely job. I know she's well taken care of by a friendly staff who always remembers her when she comes in, and that she won't be kept cooped up in a kennel the entire time I'm gone. They screen all dogs they take in with a trial day to ensure they have safe temperaments, and then separate approved dogs who utilize their daycare and boarding services by size into play rooms. These playrooms have an indoor space and an outdoor space, when whether permits, complete with playgrounds and sometimes doggy pools. In addition to great mental stimulation and physical exercise, these room setups are a great way to keep your dog well socialized with other pups! And while you're away, you can check on your dog in these rooms via a webcam app - great accountability, not to mention fun. My girl always comes home happy and tired out - thanks, Camp BowWow!
