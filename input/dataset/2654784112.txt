Don't ever use the pharmacy here unless and want your prescription to never be ready when you need it.  They are all in a shitty mood and always tell me that they need more staff and are over their heads in work.  The deli counter makes me nervous that they never clean the slicer or the tub of meat that they use to cut the plastic off the boars head packaging for every meat.... Nasty. I do go here for TP and soda only because it 1/2 mile from my place.
