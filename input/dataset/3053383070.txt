Here is a 3rd review for any of the folks wondering whether to bring your vehicle here. I was contacted by the wash and asked to give them another chance; I did today. Nothing changed, I waited 35 minutes while 3 or 4 others behind me got completed. I had to walk up to one of the guys in the red shirt to find out why it was still sitting there.They proceeded to put someone on it and instead of dry it, he put tire dressing all over my tires, bumpers and flares. Something I always ask them to never do since its a jeep for God sake. I purchased the works, so they clearly had no idea what was included.I waited another 20 minutes while they finished and when it was done, the back window had not been cleaned and the front bumper and grill was full of dirt. No apologies for the wait and no attention to detail.This place is close to us but I am glad there is another car wash going up down the street. This place won't make it unfortunately.
