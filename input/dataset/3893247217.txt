Stopped in for lunch with my kids and in-laws before going on the train. Everything was delicious. We shared onion rings, the kids had chicken fingers and pancakes. I had the turkey soup which was excellent and my wife had the chicken souvlaki wrap. All very yummy with generous portions. We'll be back!
