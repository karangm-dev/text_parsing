I have been coming here for over 5 years. Tom is AMAZING!! Always takes his time and does a great job. Lee does pedicures and manicures she is also very good. Takes her time.This shop is always busy but, definitely worth the wait. I drive 5 miles to come to U2 Nails but, it is worth it. I know that I will be happy.
