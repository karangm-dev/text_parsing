Prices are alright ,  I been buy there since I move to Blue diamond area ,but I got 4 trees one of them sick , I planted and I never grew up , I got dry and then died , I ask them if they can exchange and they said it's ok , I expend a lot of money on my backyard so I was waiting to save some money to pay the landscape guy to pull it out , when I finally went there they say no, we don't exchange , I paid $200 dollars for that tree
