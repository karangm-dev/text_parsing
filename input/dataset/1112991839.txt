my oh my...... I loved this place. Not only is it completely vegan, but they also have booze! The drink style reminded me of my favorite bar back home in Seattle (I was visiting from out of town). They are unqiue and forms of art. The drink I ordered did not have the right taste for me, but I liked the character it had. Luckily my friend liked it and I liked hers so we traded. We ordered quite a few dishes and each was fantastic taste. I wish I had one of these back home.
