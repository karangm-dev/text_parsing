Cannot praise this place enough!!  If there were 10 stars, I'd give them a 10 star rating.  I called them about some custom lighting I needed for my handicap van and they scheduled an appointment for me to come in and see Jay for advisement.  The service was impeccable, the pricing was reasonable, and they were honest.  I plan to go back for some other custom work and will be letting everyone I know what a great place this is to deal with.  It's a nice relief when you find a great business when there are so many questionable businesses these days.  Highly recommend!!
