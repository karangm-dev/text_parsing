If I could leave a 0 star review, I would. Ladies. Beware. My husband and I went in to pick out shirts for work. The associate who assisted us could not have been more disrespectful. He ignored me the entire time, only speaking to my husband. Whenever I said anything, he looked so disgusted. Referred to me as "little lady" or "young girl". When we needed a size that wasn't in stock, he suggested a few things. 1) Have the "little lady at home" move the button the the neck and 2) just not button it and tie the tie without the button being buttoned. It's a $60 shirt. When we declined his suggestions, he begrudgingly ordered it. When he learned that we were married he said to my husband "see? You do have someone at home to sew that for you." I informed him that I do not sew, and my husband is perfectly capable of learning to do so himself. When we went to leave, he shook my husbands hand and said "thank you sir" and looked at me and nodded, "little lady". We will not be returning to this store as long as this gentleman works there.
