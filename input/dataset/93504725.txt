Went there on 1/3/2014 after purchasing vouchers for myself and 2 friends.  The massage was not the best.  The pressure was inadequate.  After the massages for the 3 of us, they would not let us leave till we left the tips that they wanted $10-15 minimum.  We had to comply in order to leave.  It was very uncomfortable.
