Tried to get a to-go order but couldn't because they don't do to-go orders after 8pm. WHAT!? We decided to go, since we were only 5min away but ended up waiting a good 20 min for the wrong sandwich! We frequent this place often but will think twice before going back especially with all the other great restaurants in the area.
