While in Las Vegas...we had been craving empanadas @ home...but the place we wanted to go to was always closed (go figure).  So he YELP'D Argentine/Italian food Las Vegas and we found this place.  Okay, in a strip mall somewhere deep in Chinatown (you can get as many food massages along the road as you want).  Cute little Deli/restaurant.  We had a 1/2 carafe of wine with one of their grill meals for 2.  YUM YUM YUM.  So the negative?  No one really needs that much dead cow...but it was quite yummy with a side gargantuan salad.  Bread with some chimichuri sauce.  OOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  and they have EMPANADAS!  We had a few of those also.  Again, off the strip and this is why people should visit Las Vegas!
