I don't know if it's a problem with their communication with Frigidaire or what, but these guys seriously need to work on their appointment scheduling. I had an appointment, no one showed up. No one called. I had to wait until Monday to call and talk to someone and reschedule. I got a new appointment for Tuesday. Someone was supposed to arrive by noon. Nope, I called and was told it would be closer to three. Nope. I tried calling at 4:30, they close at 4 and don't answer after that. So, I had to call again on Wednesday. Someone FINALLY came out, didn't even turn the dishwasher on and said he'd have to order parts and would come back. He left. I haven't heard anything. Another company has already been out, diagnosed the problem, and was in communication with me every step of the way. Go with someone else.
