Had a business lunch here yesterday. This was my second visit and they were both the same. Solid service with an excellent menu that is poorly executed. The kitchen staff is not up to par. The cole slaw is warm and the Cubano is cold meat with hot bread. The soups are completely void of all seasoning. This is a well designed corporate restaurant with a weak kitchen staff.
