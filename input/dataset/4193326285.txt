Excellent hands down.   Reasonably priced, great staff, and good food.     I had the southwest chicken sandwich and the handcut curly fries which were both extraordinary.    I needed to grab food fast and literally just drove by and stopped.   I wasn't familiar with the area or even had time to check others reviews, but this by far exceeded my expectations.   My friend that lives in the area says they have an excellent burger.  Unfortunately I'm out of time and will no be able to return.   I also heard sweet potato fries mentioned, which I would love to try.  Stop in, you won't be disappointed :-)
