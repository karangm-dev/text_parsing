Fast Nail just is not fast at all. Though the techs are nice and polite, they simply are slow, untrained and their work lacking finesse. I do not recommend this place. I will not be back. Details:Visit #1: We arrived as walk-ins. We were asked to come back in 3 hours. Then they called us and asked us to come back an extra 30 mins later. We were ok with that and obliged. However, even after 3 1/2 hours of delay, we still ended up waiting for an additional 20 mins before we had to leave and walked out. Visit #2: We made an appointment this time. We arrived on time and we STILL ended up waiting for 35 mins. I have been to many nail studios over the years and would not be surprised in the least if the nail techs aren't certified. The manicure was inefficient with many snags and hangnails left over, polish left on the cuticle and skin or not covering the nail completely. My nail tech was attempting to polish on the very the last molecules of nail polish out of the empty container and I had to shape my own nail because she did them all crooked. Our party of three, each one of us, left pretty disappointed.
