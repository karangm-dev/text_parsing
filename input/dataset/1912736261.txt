I've ordered almost everything on the menu and everything is fresh and delicious. The prices are very reasonable I would pay way more to eat Mexican food this good. My favorite items on the menu are nachos with half chicken and half carne asada. The chicken is just as awesome as the carne asada so that's why I do half and half. I also love the fish tacos and tortilla soup. You really can't go wrong with anything here and if you have enough room dessert I recommend finishing off your meal with a raspado. You're welcome!
