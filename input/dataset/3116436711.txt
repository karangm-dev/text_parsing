Tried Tostadas & Tacos for the first time last week, it was fantastic! Not like your ordinary chain fast food. The owners (who work the counter and cook the food) really take pride in what they serve you! I will drive an extra 10 minutes to T&T, rather than go to my local chain restaurant. I had the Carne Asada Chimichanga, the meat was tender and juicy and the portion was huge! We also got some tacos and nachos. Everything was delicious and very reasonably priced! Will be back as often as I can. Thank you for a new favorite place to go in Las Vegas, Tostadas & Tacos!
