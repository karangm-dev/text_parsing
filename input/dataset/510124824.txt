My fianc√© and I walked in an hour before close and received the dirtiest looks before we could even say what we were there for. After stating that we each wanted a small, palm sized tattoo, one employee rudely responded with "no we're not doing tattoos". Poor business practices and zero hospitality. Happy I didn't give them my money.
