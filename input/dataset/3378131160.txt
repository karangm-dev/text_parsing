Consistantly delicious! Have been going to this joint since it was actually in the now renovated WalMart section of this corner. Can not go in without having at least one vegas roll. Their rainbow roll is also a classic and fresh staple. Their Glendale roll is amazing as well! The cucumber salad is a nice starter. Although it ain't as good as it used to be their miso soup is still pretty darn good!Great sake/beer specials! They also have special rolls for the day; a great place to go have your favorites or try something new!
