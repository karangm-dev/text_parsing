Cheap prices, but GREAT food! Been here twice and I got nothing bad to say about the service or food. I had my first breakfast buffet here and went for dinner also. They had everything you can think of for breakfast! NONE of the food was old, or sitting out for a long time. Small place makes everything easy to get to and not crowded either. I would love to go back.
