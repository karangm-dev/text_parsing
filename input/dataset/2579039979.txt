Very bad first impression. Like several other "stores" inside Paris Las Vegas, the counter is facing the "street". You walk up to window, order, and are served. Would work great is not for the incredible slowness the staff today displayed. From the time I entered the line to order until I received my crepe, 30 minutes. When I did get it, they didn't have trays which isn't terrible except I still had all of my luggage since I was 20 minutes before 2 and I had a cup to fill my drink. So, 30 minutes for an overpriced crepe, poor service when they could obviously see I had a handful, and poor overall demeanor. Definitely a single star visit....
