Really was not disappointed at all. We all know there is quite a few options for buffets down on the strip but we were very happy we decided to come here and will come again EVERY time we return to Vegas. The atmosphere is obviously nice but we also had no wait (came during a week-day) and we had access to leftover breakfast stuff and all of the lunch menu! I thought 90% of things were very well made-- which I would consider impressive for a buffet, with that much food being served I do not expect everything to be the "best".Go for the bellagio-pressed waffles, the sausage, and obviously the pesto mashed potatoes and turkey for lunch! They have one of the million option Coke machines as well, so you get your own drink.The service was also really good and I did not think it was too expensive. Will be back!(Oh and the fountain doesn't start until 3pm)
