Read the menu online and decided to go in for happy hour - 1/2 off wings and $1 off all drinks. The place was empty when we got there. We sat at the bar and looked at the menu to decide what we wanted. The in-restaurant menu makes note that the 1/2 off wings are only Friday. The online menu does not make any mention of that. So their happy menu most of the time is justs $1 off drinks which is not a big deal.I ordered my drink while we looked at the menu and then we ordered a salad, wings, and a buffalo chicken flatbread - $5 special. My drink never came. I had to ask someone else after the food arrived for my drink.The food was okay and the flatbread tasted too bready. We weren't really content with our food and ended up coming home early. Also, the bill didn't reflect the $1 off my drink.
