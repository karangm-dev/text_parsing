I never write reviews unless I have an amazing experience. I am a new patient and had my first appointment with Dr. Nguyen this past Saturday. I was referred by a friend since I didn't have an Optometrist out here (I am from California). I haven't gotten my eye's checked in 6 years so i was really looking forward to this appointment. Everyone was so friendly when i walked in and they brought me back right away. I did a series of tests with machines and it was the first time i have ever done these. They have all the newest up to date technology so i was very excited about that. The doctor was so friendly and informative of what they were testing for and what we we're looking at on the screen to go over the results. My glasses prescription changed so they had me meet with someone to look at some glasses. They have a lot of variety to choose from and i found some that fit me perfectly! I would highly recommend going to this place. Definitely a 5 star experience and can't wait to go back to pick up my glasses! Thank you again Dr. Nguyen!
