Yes. Yes. YES PLEASE!!Do yourself a favor and just go. It's all about southern deliciousness, awesome drinks, huge portions, cool decor, and great service.Brunch was a great idea for us as our last meal on our girls trip. We would head to the airport on a full stomach, soak up the weekend's liquor, and ready to sleep through our 4 hour trip back to Florida.Some of the plates are clich√© (chicken, waffles, and watermelon for example) but it works. I ordered the two breakfast biscuits option. I filled them with sausage, egg, and cheese. These are NOT your McDonald's S.E.C breakfast sammiches. These sliders were bigger than I thought and I couldn't even dig into my second slider. The mac & cheese was everything baked gooeyness should embody. Lastly, the three birthday guests at my table were presented with a red velvet cheesecake. I'm not a fan of cheesecake, but this was a really good desert.Do yourself a favor and just go to YardBird!!
