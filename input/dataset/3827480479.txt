2.5 STARSAhhh...this was THE place back in the day.  Everyone went to a Café Demetre's on a Friday or Saturday night.  This particular location has been totally renovated so it looks pretty nice inside - fancy booths, upscale type of wallpaper, lightening etc.  It's also pretty large which is a good thing b/c it's always packed.  Luckily we got a booth for our group.The menu is split between ice creams; waffles/crepes; cakes etc.  I will say they have very interesting flavor combinations and the names of the desserts are hilarious  - Pomme Pilot (I feel like you need to be over 30 to get this one...LOL); Tongue Depressor; Miami Slice....you get the picture.  Points for creativity.I don't particularly have a sweet tooth - I just wanted a scoop of ice cream.  I choose the Passionfruit Sorbetto.  I'm not sure in what universe one scoop looks like 5, but it apparently in Café Demetre's world is does!  But I guess since they charge $7 for a scoop you should be happy...?The ice cream itself was nice - tart, which I like.  But I can't really justify paying $7 for it.  But I did.   Would I come back...probably not. It's a nice treat and the service we had was friendly, but gone are the memories (and the prices!) of back in the day :(
