The lasagna!!!! Don't the 5 stars say it all!!! I just wish I had a frig and a microwave in the room. The grotto salad is fresh. The bread is so soft and delicious. The fried ravioli dipped in the marinara!!! Golden Nugget, Las Vegas, the Grotto, the best. Also, Monique was a great server. Very attentive, and funny and informative about what was going on in Vegas for the weekend.We will always be back.... At least 3 times while we are in town:)))))
