I would not recommend staying at this hotel!!!! I stayed here on Friday Sept 29, for 1 night. The next day I realized I was covered with bed bug bites all over my body including my face. I contact the hotel and left several messages for the manager "Mr Dan", who never returned my call. I was forced to contact environmental health. They went out and discovered there were bed bugs in room 223. I contacted the hotel again and spoke to "Mr Chris". Well to make a long story short I WAS NOT REFUNDED, WAS HUNG UP ON TWICE, AND NOW SEEKING LEGAL REPRESENTATION. Please do not stay here. They are nasty and very rude!!!!
