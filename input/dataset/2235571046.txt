Got stuck here in Phoenix to the kenworth deal to get my truck fix after  a week was told the truck would be fix in the afternoon and it was not. Read the comments the the gm  put and he's  full of it. Your shop is the worse I have seen in 15 year. Do your salf a run as fast as you can get your truck to another shop . this one will Ben you over.this place is more like -1.
