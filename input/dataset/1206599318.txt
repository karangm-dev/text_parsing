This place is awesome!! If you're a meat lover, you may still really enjoy it! The ambiance is really hipster and the food is on point. The craft beers are solid! We are the Big Wac (a classic) and it tasted phenomenal. Everything has a different twist and the price point isn't bad. Definitely check it out!!
