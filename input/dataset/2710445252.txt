Decided to try this place after reading all these good reviews about it. I was actually very impressed! I ordered the passion roll, dragon roll, volcano roll and the dancing angel roll. Lots of use of mayo in these rolls which made it taste yummy. The presentation was very pleasing to the eye! Freshly made and delicious for a sushi joint in Scarborough. I'm going to try their sashimi next time. The bill came up to $39 with 10% off if you come by to pick it up.
