It depends on which hairdresser you choose. I have been to this place many times for the past a few years. Generally all the Japanese hairdressers are nice and friendly and they do a good job on average. However, there is a Korean speaking woman hairdresser pissed me off today. My hair looks terrible after her cut and she is very rude. I'd recommend avoiding her if you can.
