Worst experience. Saturday morning at 9:00am. Only 3 other customers in the store. Over 40 min wait with only 2 hairstylists working. They were both too chatty as they enjoyed their morning coffee. Completely disorganized. No sense of urgency. Only stop here if you have a large amount of time to spend waiting. Haircut was mediocre at best.
