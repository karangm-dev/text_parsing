Our 11 month old Great Dane just stayed with them for 8 days.. We did the interview,  and took him a few times before we left, so he could get a feel for the place.We checked on him almost every day while we were gone... The first day or 2, we were told that he didn't eat well.. (which was to be expected, due to stress) I let them know, if they add canned dog food, that will entice him.. The next day we called in and were told that he was eating better since canned dog food was added...We picked him up today, and I'm in SHOCK at how skinny he is!!.. He has lost almost 15lbs in 8 days!!.. Every vertebrae is showing, every rib is popping out, his hip bones are sticking out.. I'm actually DISGUSTED by how he looks, and how we were obviously lied to.. Our poor dog has obviously NOT eaten AT ALL!!.. No one called to tell us the issues, and when we called, we were told he was "doing so well", "and eating normally".. Had we known we'd be dropping off a healthy 102lb dog, and picking up a sickly 90lb dog, I would've had my brother or sister pick him up sooner!!!...I just paid $350 for them to almost destroy our dog, and now have to take him to ER to make sure he's OK!!!..Â (doctor said he had obviously not eaten in days) and we are waiting on bloodwork to come back, to see if there are any other issues, other than the severe weight loss, dripping nose, and raspy cough.. (and YES he DID have his Bordarella vaccine!)This is NOT OK!!!!!PS. They were closed when we got home, and noticed how thin he really was.. I have left voicemails and sent an email.. Will update this review, when/if I hear back.
