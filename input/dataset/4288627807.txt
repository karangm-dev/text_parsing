After finally being able to find a stylist i loved who dyed my hair, she moved to Vancouver. I have been scared to find another hair stylist to cut my hair as I've been through horror stylists. I decided to come here because of the great yelp reviews and that it is very close to my home. I woke up in the morning and called for an appointment and went right away. I didn't mind what stylist i got and i ended up with Sam. He was very patient with me and was clearly very knowledgeable in his field. I washed my hair right before and he asked if he could wet it. He ended up putting conditioner in my hair without charge which i was afraid he was going to without letting me know.I showed him a picture i wanted which was the style i had currently had but just wanted a trim and he did just that. He gave me tips along the way and giving recommendations. He took his time with my suggestions that took 1 hour. He was very easy to talk to and was very kind to me. I would 100% recommend Sam.
