I went in to Dr Fedoriw after getting nowhere with the large spine clinic that my primary care doctor first referred me to. First off, they saw me in under a week of my first call, whereas the first place had a 6 week wait!!Dr Fedoriw was so personable and thorough. He read my CT and MRI findings and within 5 minutes found issues in my cervical spine that the neurologist and first spinal surgeon totally missed. This is an ongoing issue that he's treating me for, but so far I couldn't be happier with his knowledge and care. Highly recommended!!
