Arthur is a fantastic mechanic. He has a wealth of experience and made me feel like family. I had a called around to several area mechanics to replace my power steering pump in my BMW and he gave me the best feeling and quote. He is very genuine and trustworthy and really worked with me to explained what he was going to do. The quote he promised was the price I paid and his work has been working great. Independence Automotive should be the place where you take your car for fast, friendly, A+ service.
