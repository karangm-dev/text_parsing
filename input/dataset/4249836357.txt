Was walking through the Excalibur when some folks threw these buy one get one free tickets in my hand. As we were parched from the August sun, we decided to grab a drink and take advantage of the deal. We should have known that if they are doing these "deals" then something was up.Yes, we knew it was a spoof and that the wait staff made silly hats for people and were rude, but the female bartender we got at the bar was just plain rude. First, we were traveling with two Germans who did not know what they wanted to drink in the split second the bartender wanted us to order. She was speaking too fast for them to follow and she was yelling at them. This was not a joke of any kind. She kept saying come on! come on! I got other customers! There were no other customers because the bar was empty except for us. I asked her to calm down and explained that my friends were German, but she kept yelling. Honestly, I don't know why we stayed excepted we needed a drink. We finally ordered, but the bartender was just b!tchy and rude and left a truly negative impression on us.No wonder they have to offer buy one get one free. The place was empty and at least from our experience their b!tchy bartender is part of the problem.
