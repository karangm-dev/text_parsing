I have never written a review on a restaurant before. Based on the reviews, we decided to go to Line Thai tonight. We walked in and were seated. We were given a death trap high chair for our 6 month old and my 5 year old was given nothing. I asked if they had a kids menu and he said no but our only option would be to order a full adult dinner plate for our son. We sat there for at least 10 minutes and nobody had come to the table. The place was NOT busy. It was then that we decided to leave. I have never in my entire life walked out of a restaurant. If I walk in, I order. If I don't like it, I just don't come back. I couldn't even do that here! We were getting up to leave and a waitress finally came to our table. We told her why we were leaving and instead of offering something to get us to stay, she just said "okay!" Glad I didn't spend my money here! NOT kid friendly!
