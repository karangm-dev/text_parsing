I've stayed here for the past 6-7 years and I have watched this place deteriorate into a seedy brothel.  WARNING!  You WILL be called on the phone by a prostitute in your room.  I promise!  It's happened the last two times I've stayed here (once at 3am).  This place is HELL!  The only reason why I've stayed here is because they take dogs.  Now I'm finally done and will NEVER stay here again.  This last time a prostitute was staying next door (she was walking the parking lot looking for clients!)SERIOUSLY!  Look somewhere else.  Anywhere, just not here!
