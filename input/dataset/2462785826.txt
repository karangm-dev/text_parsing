I go to Flury's quite frequently. I've tried most things on the menu and have loved almost all. The quesadillas are the only thing that I don't love - they are kind of basic.  My favorite breakfast items are the chorizo scramble, pesto tomato omelette, country fried steak. For lunch, I lovee the caprese chicken sandwich - the pesto in it is delicious.  The chicken spinach salad is also delicious and very filling with a homemade dressing. Mac and cheese is good too when I am craving something cheesy. I basically love it all.
