Let me start off by saying that I love shopping at local boutiques and I really wanted to love Lotus. The store is very bright, clean and inviting, but that is pretty much the only positives  I could say. The items there seem like over price sweat shop crap. Everything seems to be made of cheap jersey and/or polyester. Pretty much Forever 21 quality with four times the price tag. I did buy what I thought would be a cute cocktail dress, an embellished necklace, and earrings. What a waste of money! A seam on the dress became undone after one wear!! The rhinestones came off the necklace, and the earrings turned in color.  NEVER AGAIN!!!
