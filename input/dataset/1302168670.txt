This is as good as Jewish food gets around these here parts! I just enjoyed my umpteenth Corned Beef Reuben sandwich here and want to report that this is the place to take your Jewish friends and relatives from out of town. Unlike Chompie's, the food is authentic, it is not wildly overpriced for touristas and it's not crowded. The wait staff is very friendly and accommodating. The Scottsdale location is open and airy and very laid back. Only complaint might be that they need to get some of their booths reupholstered because the cushions have worn out!
