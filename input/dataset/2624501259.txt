Bad service (After waiting pretty much an hour for our food, when it did come, there were no plates or utensils. I got my apple juice in a 300 ml plastic bottle and no cup. When we did the waiter brought out the cup holding it with his two fingers on the brim of the cup.) , Miso soup was cold, lady was very rude, and I will never go back.
