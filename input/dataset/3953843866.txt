Would highly recommend them. The flowers that were sent to me were absolutely beautiful. They looked beautiful for well over a week and half. The Lillie's were the flowers to be the first to wilt. The rest of the flowers thrived for a little over 2 weeks. I only had 3 Lillie's in the gorgeous flower arrangement.I also use this same florist to send a flower arrangement for a dear friends birthday and the flowers were delivered on time and the flower arrangement was for a dear friend and the flower arrangement was gorgeous. The flowers still look as beautiful as the day she received them (she told me) She has had the flowers now for 6 days.You want beautiful and fresh flowers order from Arizona Florist.
