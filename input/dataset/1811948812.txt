I don't come here as often I used to, due to them removing their gas pumps, but I always have a pleasant visit.  The owners are very friendly and courteous.  The location of the store can be a bit sketch, but the store is always clean and they actively work on removing graffiti on the outside of the store.Keep up the good work!
