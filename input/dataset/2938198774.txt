I am so incredibly disappointed with Best Buy's Geek Squad (both Ahwahtukee and now Scottsdale). Have received the run around since January and I am now on my 7th visit to try to rectify the same problem that they created when they installed a new motherboard incorrectly back then. They wiped my computer clean without notifying me and they accidentally lost my charger when they sent it to Kentucky this most recent go-round. They tried to charge me an additional $810 for a new motherboard but when I contested (seeing as they had just put a new MB in in January) they said they just needed to reinstall the motherboard they put in incorrectly in January. When I went to pick up my computer (freshly cleaned of 8k photos, word, nitro, and other expensive programs), they tried to charge me $80 even though the Kentucky tech said it would free since it was their mistake in the first place.  a couple hours after picking it up, I was back at Best Buy because my computer would not open an internet browser, let me type, or allow me to connect to any network. That was Monday and It is now Wednesday and no one has even called to let me know what the problem is... Seriously could not be more frustrated with this process!!!!!! I would NOT recommend the Geek Squad if you want a stress free experience while working through your tech troubles :(
