This review mainly goes to the staff at the Cravings Buffet. Do not get me wrong, the food was spectacular, but the staff is what made my experience so impeccable.I went to brunch with my ladies for my best friend's birthday and we chose to come here as our location, since we received a credit from the hotel. What sold us what the bottomless mimosas. Everyone knows you can't have brunch without mimosas and, wow, did those mimosas keep coming. Whenever our glass was almost empty, Brandon, one of the waiters, made sure to refill our glasses. He was so attentive to our table and we really appreciate it.I happened to get some fried rice from the Asian cuisine station, after I had enough breakfast food, and noticed that the rice wasn't fresh. All the other food was so delicious and I didn't want that one thing to be ruined. So I told Brandon that the rice didn't taste right and without me knowing that he was even going to do anything about it, I'm greeted 15 minutes later by Fausto Vela, the Asst. Main Kitchen-Chef, with a huge fresh plate of fried rice for my ladies and I. He said "I hope this is to your liking and if it isn't then we'll make it again." Trust me, it was SOOO SCRUMPTIOUS! So tasty. I was extremely thankful and when I'm in Vegas again I'll be sure to visit and thank them for such a wonderful experience.
