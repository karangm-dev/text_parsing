BEWARE: Absolutely horrible invasion of privacy with new security measures and it's ultra crowded with tourists, many from out of the country. And, wait for it... you have to pay separate ($10+) just to park!! I was here long ago when the USA wasn't a PC and security nightmare and it was 100 times more fun and cheaper. It's now just a military/totalitarian style tourist trap, reminiscent of some North Korean project that Un himself would approve of.  The only people who think this is a 5-star place to go are likely really old or very sheltered people who have never been out of their own town before. They are also the type that think Disney is loads of fun on a weekend after paying $100+ then waiting 2 hours just to ride one stupid ride. WTF is wrong with people now??If you take the very expensive and boring dam tour, beware that you now have to submit to x-ray machines and millimeter wave machines just like you see at the airport. OH and you have to take your shoes off, as if someone is going to hurt a billion tons of concrete with something you can hide in your shoes... LOL! I HATE this place now and will never return as it will only get worse as the country fills with more idiots. On top of that, well before you enter the dam there are security pawns who will stop your car and peer in it, as if that would do anything. The whole security process is a joke; it's unconstitutional and very unsanitary. Think about it.. you put your phone and personal items in a box that people have been putting their nasty shoes into, you walk on a floor that 1000's have stepped on with their nasty feet and shoes, you get exposed to harmful machines.. all in the name of false security. People need to put a foot down! DO NOT LET THE WORLD TURN INTO A POLICE STATE! YOU ARE LETTING IT HAPPEN BY APPROVING THIS ACTION!
