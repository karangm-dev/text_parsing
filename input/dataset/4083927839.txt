It's a favorite new spot after work!! I've loved their location off Campbell but this location is super for my after work decompression time! Usually the service is outstanding but sometimes you do get That Waiter/Waitress that isn't into it. I've had some awesome ones that are fun, outgoing and genuinely dig what they're doing! The bruschetta is the Bomb and that's the Pull!! Every one of them is delicious to accompany the vast assortment of wines/spirits that compliment the goodness before you!! Salads are also a favorite there! Salads are tricky at restaurants sometimes- here they know the importance of crisp fresh lettuce without a great base the salad is subpar. They always are on point with that! Kudos! The atmosphere is fun as well! Great to people watch and I have always had a great time with other guests there!! I highly recommend an evening dining there after shopping or work!! You can't go wrong...unless you get a not so great server. That can definitely make or break the experience!! That has only happened once to me there...it's disappointing but it happens and it won't spoil your meal experience because the food is That Good!!
