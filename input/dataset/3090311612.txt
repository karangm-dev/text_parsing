The Loan Officer was great and was my home builder's recommended lender. I was a bit trepidatious at first, but after speaking with Michael and him explaining the process to me, my fears were put the rest. His assistant Autumn was FANTASTIC; She was definitely the most helpful and made the process enjoyable!
