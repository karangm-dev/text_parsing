This is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. The Chilean sea bass 10/10 is the most scrumptious skewer of tender fish and it literally will melt in your mouth. The Peruvian bay scallops garlic style (not on the menu ask for this!!!) are also not to be missed.Excellent sake selection, and they will also reheat your bottle for you if it gets lukewarm.The Yamato roll 10/10. Served with foie gras - I just wish there were more than 3 dang guess I gotta order seconds.
