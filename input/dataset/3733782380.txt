This is a fun place to go to and it's kid friendly too! We were greeted by a nice gentleman that walked us to our area and he was very friendly and gave us information on how to use the golf screen. Then a few minutes later we were greeted by Lauren to ask us what kind of drinks or any food we would like to order. She continued to check on us frequently and made the experience that much better. We ordered a pizza flatbread, chips with salsa and guacamole, and French fries with ranch. We all also ordered drinks that were brought out to us very quickly and we never had to look for anyone to order the next. All the appetizers we ordered were delicious and came out quickly as well. We did one hour of golf and it was a fun experience with some great views. Also living in Arizona it can get very hot, but they do everything they can do to make you forget how hot it actually is by keeping us cool with misters and fans. I will be back and next time I will be bringing my son.
