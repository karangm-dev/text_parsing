Love the food, fast and friendly service. One waitress always remembers me and asks about my baby girl when I go in there. (Sometimes after MONTHS of not going in.) This place gets super packed around lunch time but I can see why. Again, excellent and authentic (I'm from San Diego and know my Mexican food). They are also priced well. My husband is a big guy and we both leave full for about $20 average.
