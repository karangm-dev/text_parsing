I can't comment on the food because we never even got to try it, but the service is horrendous! We were sat pretty quickly, but after not even receiving a water in the first 15 minutes of being there we decided to leave.  The restaurant was NOT busy at all... the place that we are sitting at now sat is immediately, water on the table in 3 minutes, and had beers in hand within 5 minutes.  Spend your money where you matter.  We will not be giving this place another chance.
