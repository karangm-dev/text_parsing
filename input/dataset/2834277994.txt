This is a great hotel.  I just came back from a conference there and have to say that I was impressed.  The rooms (suites, actually) are ginormous, and the service was impeccable.  The conference food was decent, but not spectacular, but you really can't expect great things when trying to feed 6000 people.  The conference and ballroom areas were spacious and well tailored for our company's 5-day gathering.My room had 3 phones, 2 TVS, a tub and  glass shower stall, separate toilet room, vanity counter, two sinks, a fax / printer, living room area with table, couch, desk, Internet.The bars and restaurants are good, and I have to say that for some reason, the taxi and valet service were less chaotic and more speedy than any other LV I've been to.Yes, the company paid for my $1K stay there, but I'd definitely consider going back.  The Bellagio may be a little more elegant, but I don't think you can beat the square footage and amenities.
