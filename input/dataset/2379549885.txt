If you're in a bind for quick dim sum and all the other restaurants are full, Regency is the place to go. This is one large restaurant that can accommodate a lot of people. Having said that, the food here is mediocre at best and more often than not, quickly slapped together for the mass guests. The dim sum is sloppy with very little care to the cooking techniques so critical to each morsel of yumminess. Some of the items were over cooked while others were undercooked or lacked a depth of flavor. Like I said, unless you're in a pinch, I'd pass on Regency as there are many other good dim sum restaurants in Calgary.
