I love Carl's but this location sucks.  Every time I drive past it it's empty and now I know why.  Had a breakfast biscuit meal and it was gross.  Biscuit crunched as I bit into it because of how old and stale it was, and the sausage did not taste like sausage.  It was rubbery and looked like it was recooked at least 3 times.  If the employees weren't so busy on there cell phones behind the counter they might be able to actually cook food instead of throwing some slop together.
