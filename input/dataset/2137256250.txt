So it is 5 stars when Josh(Im pretty sure it is Josh) is our waiter and 4 when he is not.  He is far more personable than the last waiter who messed up my birthday dessert.  The food is really good!  As someone who is sticking to seafood and veggies, they have plenty on the menu. The chef changes the menu with the seasons so if you eat there a few times a season you will find new and tasty treats.  The decor is really beautiful and they play old movies without sound.  It makes for nice background visuals.  If you reserve on open table I think there is only one table they seat you at and it is next to the server stand.  You might want to call if this annoys you. It does put you in Josh's section so that's the plus side.  They also make tasty drinks and stock Laphroaig.  The last waiter (not Josh) put ice in my scotch, since I did not ask for it on the rocks it was annoying.  However it is a cardinal sin to waste scotch.  I love that it is not in a casino and that it is quite low key. I wish they hosted a Casablanca night.
