It's such a humbling experience being able to volunteer at this place for a week. This facility is the biggest out of all the Opportunity Villages in town. They have four or five different sections that have their client busy with mind stimulating activities and another building that's just dedicated to fine & performing arts. The clients in the pride room are well taken care of with about one to one ratio staff. They're require assistance in everything that they do so they always have a caregiver/social worker with them. The workers in this room are the sweetest, most caring people I've ever met. They have so much patience, kindness and love for the people they care for. Enable has about 30 clients and a 5:1 ration when it comes to client and caregiver. These individuals need to be watched but can navigate through their daily lives semi independently. Their surroundings aid them in having a normal life.Next door is the Nova room. That's where the higher functioning individuals go to keep their hands busy. They make arts and crafts such as pi√±ata which they use as decoration in their holiday attraction events and some to sell. The fine and performing arts building offers three classes; music, dance and arts/crafts. The highest functioning individuals in their program are placed with this group. My confusion was, at one point I couldn't even tell who was a worker there and who was a client. It was mesmerizing to see how normal they are! I had the most fun interacting with them and listening to their individual stories. It made my heart melt.
