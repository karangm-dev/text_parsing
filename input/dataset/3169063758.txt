Food's ok but service is poor. I called in my order ahead, got there to find out the person who took the order saved a ticket with only my name (no food) so nothing was prepared. I had to re-order, wait 20 minutes, I decided to double check the order before leaving and good thing because we were missing 1/3 of the items. After all of the issues and extra time it took from my lunch break, the staff didn't offer anything for the trouble, no discount, future coupon, a drink while I waited, or an apology for the mix ups.
