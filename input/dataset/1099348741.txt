Stay away!  Rip off artists.  I had them come to give me an estimate on some plumbing work.  The guy put on quite a show hemming and hawing.  Then going out to "call his boss" before coming in and giving me an estimate 5 times higher then what I got the work done for by a legitimate plumber.   I don't know how these people sleep at night.
