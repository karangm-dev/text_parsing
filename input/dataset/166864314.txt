Having been here several times, I can say I fully agree with a previous reviewer who said the two optometrists at this location are excellent, but the staff and overall atmosphere are below par. While the optometrists were helpful and friendly, I have found the staff to be defensive and rude. On one occasion, I requested an appointment for a specific reason but was told the person I needed to see was on holidays for two weeks. Since I needed the issue taken care of as quickly as possible, I said unfortunately, I'd have to research other options. I was then told I could come in the next day to see someone. I was extremely confused and asked for clarification on why I was now able to make my appointment. I found the staff member very short with me and I ended up going elsewhere (to Bloor Optical, which was also more affordable.)
