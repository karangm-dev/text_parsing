I was really looking forward to visiting after having some of their beers. The "Man O'War" quickly became my favorite DIPA; the Rusulka Vanilla Stout is a good thick, sweet stout; and the Ironclad is a top notch IPA. The only big miss on their beers I've had is the Big Chuck Barleywine. It could probably benefit greatly with age, but at this age all there is to taste is the alcohol.  Nonetheless, I had enough to convince me that the other beers I hadn't had from them would be top notch... and they are! The reason for the 2 stars should not reflect the quality of the brewers, they obviously know their craft well! The servers are great and friendly.... but relying on two servers to wait on 100+ customers says a lot about how inexperienced management must be. In fact, after waiting 15 mins at a dirty table I was finally able to track down someone I guessed was an employee to let them know we were even there! After another 5+ mins, the GM finally stopped over to take our drink order. The smugness of this guy was amazing. The thought of offering a simple apology never seemed to enter into his head. This is the time a server finally stopped by to pick up the non-final check left by the party before us... who didn't seem very pleased when leaving. The toast & cheese was good, but by the time we were able to dig into their heartiest offering of food, saltines and butter may have been equally pleasing.
