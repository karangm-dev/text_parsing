I love this restaurant. From the beautiful interior to the outstanding service top to bottom, to truly excellent food, it is an experience that can't be beat. Much already has been written about the voluminous and wonderful antipasto you get even before you are handed a menu. Yum. Everything was wonderful, though, including the best Dover Sole Meuniere I've ever had, roasted whole, shown at the table, then filleted perfectly, not a bone. Damn was that good. But, again, it was all so good! Wonderful roast potatoes, some of the best spinach I've ever had (saut√©ed with garlic), my friend had a divine salmon with what we all thought were some of the best mushrooms we've ever had... I could go on and on! I will also note, though. the beautiful simplicity of the lemon sorbet, frozen in a whole lemon: divine. And the best Affogato I'ver ever been served. All of the service was splendid. Our captain, Bali Kovary, was the best I've ever had. He is supreme. Give this place a try, ask for Bali, sit back and let them do their work. You will enjoy a long, wonderful meal.
