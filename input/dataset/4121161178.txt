Prantls I used to love Prantl's. USED TO being the words of import in that sentence. Back when the actual Prantl family owned it, it was basically a staple of Shadyside, and Pittsburgh in general. Now, it's garbage. Two owners later, the prices are higher than ever but the quality is awful. And the people who raaaave about the torte should have tried it 25 years ago when it was fresh and actually worth eating.  My mother, who can't let go of the past, still wants a marble cake for every birthday/ Mother's Day/anniversary even though we get it and she remarks "it wasn't that good this time..." Well, here are, and Mother's Day has arrived and guess what? Prantl's fucked me again. I called and ordered a marble cake with Happy Mother's Day and flowers on it. First, they quoted me a price of $16.99 when I ordered it on the phone. So, when I went to pick it up, not only was I charged $20.99, they didn't have any flowers on it and THEY WROTE HAPPY MOTHER'S DAY IN WHITE ICING. THE FUCKING CAKE IS WHITE!!!! I didn't realize until I got home how much I was charged, so I called. Again, over the phone they told me the price for a marble was $16.99, and $18.99 with "decoration". So when I asked why I was just charged $20.99, the girl said "oh, the price went up." WTF? Really, WTF? I want to know in what normal world do you use white icing to a write on a white cake?
