This was the best Greek place I have been to in Charlotte. I loved that it was clean and quiet and how fast the food came. I had the Mezze platter to try something different and I was impressed with how good & fresh everything looked and tasted. the spinach pies were off the hook. This is a must if you swing by the Colony Rd area. I will definitely be back.
