My nephews and niece wanted Mexican for dinner and they mentioned this place.  I was not impressed.  1st the ordering system is really out of the ordinary and complicated when trying to order for 6 people.  They have 3 different lines for specific types of tacos so if you are wanting to try different types you will have to stand in all three lines.  The thing that really upset me was the terrible service.  I mentioned to the lady who was walking around that it was my first time visiting and she shrugged her shoulders and didn't offer me any direction on how to order.  I finally figured it out after watching other people order so I got in line.  2nd the guy making the tacos was super rude and almost annoyed at the fact that I was ordering different types of tacos.  3rd when I finally made it to the register to pay I had to wait until the girl at the register was done talking to another employee about how she couldn't wait to get out of work.  I'm standing there holding a tray with 25 tacos and she doesn't even bother to say one moment please they just ignore me as if I'm not even there.  4th the food was cold because the meats are sitting in a bin and all they do is chop it up when you order it, they don't even reheat it. I'm assuming the holding bin is suppose to keep the meats hot but it wasn't.  Qualify of meat gets a C.  Flavor gets a D.  Service gets an F.  I will not be back.
