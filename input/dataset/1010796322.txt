This is the place to avoid. Beware of what they claim market price live fish, my recommendation is that if you have to order live fish, let them show you it is alive before cooking. I wouldn't trust what they say. In the end, they included the tip in our bill. If you visit this place, you might want to pay attention to this if you don't want double tip them.
