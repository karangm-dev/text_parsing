First off very convenient due to myself living nearby this location. When walking in the gentleman was assisting a couple with getting fingerprinted and soon after assisted myself with getting my alcohol awareness test out of the way. I would highly recommend this office, not only can you study and take quizzes online, but soon as you go into the office you don't pay until you pass the exam. I passed my first time with a 100%, because again the written material and quizzes do give you the answers to the 20 question test. I was literally in and out less than 10 minutes!
