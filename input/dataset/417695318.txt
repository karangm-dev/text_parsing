One word-OUTSTANDING! Kristin came to our home, set up her massage table, and gave massages to my wife and 2 teenage boys. Great experience and very relaxing for the whole family! When I asked one of my sons how he liked his first ever  massage, his response was, "That's what I want for my next birthday!" Thank you, Kristin, we HIGHLY recommend you and your super massage services!
