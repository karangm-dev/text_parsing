this place is the only place i go for my haircuts!!! i love this place and i have been loyal to amazing cuts since it opened. I would recommend to anyone. The prices are great, it is a very clean location and David the owner is really a great guy. Dont go to another chain place but instead support a small business and go to amazing cuts!!!
