My first time flying with Alaska Air... I was really surprised by the awesome customer service. I have flown with other airlines before and have always waited at least 45 minutes to an hour before being able to speak to a customer service representative. I had to revise my itinerary this past weekend (Seattle to Phoenix) and had to call in 4 times. Not once did I wait more than 2 minutes to speak to a real life representative. The reps were also very polite and funny! Go Alaska Air!
