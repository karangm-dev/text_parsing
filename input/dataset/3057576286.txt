I made reservations with Payless through Southwest Airlines for the Phoenix Airport. When I got to the rental desk, there was a long line, and some of the people ahead of me had been waiting for about half an hour. My wait to get to an agent was only about 10-15 minutes. When I did get to an agent, I was told my car would not be available for FIVE HOURS!!! The agent seemed to be at a loss - no offer was made to help get a car from another rental agency. No apologies, no excuse, just that they wouldn't have any cars for 5 hours. I walked over to Hertz and got a car immediately. Hertz was great.I will never rent from Payless again, no matter how much less they cost.
