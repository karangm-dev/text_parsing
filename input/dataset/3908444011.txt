The staff was rude, rushed me while ordering In Drive thru and then asked "is your order right on the screen?" Then changed it to a picture so I couldn't review it and I said "I'm not sure, the screen changed to a picture" she replied with "k go ahead and pull forward" totally disregarding my comment and rushing me. Once I got to the window the cashier did not say hello just said "9.08" so I-gave her my card and she ran it and handed it back without saying one word then handed me my bags. Very poor customer service!  oh and I wasn't given a receipt!
