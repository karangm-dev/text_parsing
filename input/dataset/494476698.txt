I was very skeptical about DAS by reading the previous reviews. I worked with Ashley and Andrea and they were amazing. Ashley responded quickly to any questions or concerns that I had. Andrea followed up with me in regards to when my car was picked up and the estimated time of arrival. I was relocating from WNY to Arizona.My car was picked up on MLK day. I was told my car would be in Arizona on Jan 30th and it arrived Jan 27th. My car came back spotless with no damages. I am very pleased with the service that I received and I would highly recommended DAS.
