Took my dog here for his first groom since adoption. He loved it and he looked amazing. Michelle did a fantastic job. She even let my dog text me to tell me he was done. ;)The selection of products is pretty impressive, too. If you're looking for something and can't find it at PetSmart/Petco? It's probably here.It's a little bit out of the way for me, but if you're in Henderson/Green Valley, I can't recommend them enough.
