Partell Specialty Pharmacy is the worse pharmacy in the world - they should be closed down. I have been trying since December to get my Rx filled, even with the Dr's office calling and faxing them they CANNOT get it correct; 5 trips I've made over the last 3 months! I went in today, after confirming by phone with the pharmacist yesterday, that it's correct and ready for pickup & they look at me like they don't understand why I came in . . . since they have nothing ready for me. Then when the woman at the counter went in back to have the compound filled she comes back with a jar dated 2/4/2013 that is scheduled to expire on 3/4 and tells me I should have come in on time to pick it up - I almost screamed: I was there in December, again in January, then on Feb 4th & again on Feb 14th because they kept saying my Doctor wanted me to have pills instead of a compound - except they were incorrect, they wouldn't believe me, the dr's office or even the empty jar I brought in that had been previously filled FROM THEIR PHARMACY. I finally got them to fill it (but I think they just changed the label to show a different date. when I asked "how can I prevent this from happening again?" she looked at me with a straight face & said "next time come in on time to pick up your prescription".  THEY SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED
