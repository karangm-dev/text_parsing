We have just moved to the Goodyear area and needed to find a vet for our German Shepherd, we are very impressed with the care that we received at Palm Valley.  Recently we ahd to take him back as he had injured his leg, care and attention by the entire staff was great and our dog was given some "miracle" meds that worked the very next day and gave our dog a new lease of life!  Thank you so much, it shows that you care.
