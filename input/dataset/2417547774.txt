took a long time to even be noticed to get seated.  Once done service was good.  Food was rather oily.  Mom had a burrito of some sort, and me fajitas.  I would rather go to Laredos for fajitas.That day waiter seemed interested in flirting with some girls down the row of the tables, but whatever.  I wasnt asking for that, just asking for a little more attentiveness from him as a restaurant server.
