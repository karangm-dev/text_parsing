11/16/17: I came here with my iPhone 6 plus screen repair after consulting with multiple other technicians. Akila was very professional, proficient and speedy with his repair. He will subtract $5 from the best price you're quoted elsewhere, though keep in mind he will call and verify. Also, he offers both OEM as well as generic parts at multiple price points. Highly recommended!Update 11/18/17: After a day of tinkering, I noticed that the original repair left my home button with a slight, but noticeable, wiggle. I also detected a smudge on the upper portion of the interior surface of the replacement glass panel. Which is no negative at all because the takeaway here is that Akila takes pride in his work. He made no excuses and immediately offered to resolve the above issues with no questions asked. I left my phone with him and returned an hour later to find it better than new.
