The room was cute, but that's where the good part of the review ends. The customer service wasn't good at all. Bridget is who helped us, who knows maybe she was having a bad day. No matter where you stay in this fancier version of a holiday inn you will hear airplanes flying right over you. Maybe if we didn't have loud ass neighbors this review would get 3 stars. Overall that's a check off of our hotel bucket list, and I can say with confidence we will never stay here again.
