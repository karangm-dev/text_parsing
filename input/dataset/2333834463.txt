What a disappointment!!! I love Guy's shows on food network and I expected a higher level of excellence from one of his restaurants.  I ordered the Vegas fries and after waiting for about 25 minutes they came out ice cold, soggy and with barely a hint of blue cheese crumbles.  My son had the mac n cheese burger which was pretty good but the fries he got had so much seasoning that they looked like the seasoning bottle was dropped on them and most were inedible. The sweet iced tea tasted like the swiss sweet tea you buy by the gallon for 2.99.  My husband had the wings which were ok but nothing special i can make much better at home but the celery they brought with them looked like the pcs that you throw away before chopping, the leafy yellow soft part, when he complained the waitress said they come pre-made.  That left us perplexed.   To top off the evening the waitress spilled blue cheese dressing all over my sons pants.   If you want good food, fresh brewed iced tea and good service go to Burgr from Gordon Ramsey
