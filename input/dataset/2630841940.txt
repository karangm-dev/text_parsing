When bad pizza and service go bad. No hot and ready, manager on cell, and doesn't give a shit about customer service. The cashier had to cut pizza and go straight to register without washing his hands. Has anybody had this experience before? The Little Caesar Pizza manager said she spoke to Mike the owner and that everything was fine. She was more concerned about speaking to the owner and making sure she was heard first before filling up the empty warmers with pizza! Michael, please get an employee that cares about your customers.A couple waited close to five minutes (while I waited, they were sitting waiting on their pizza before I got there) for O-N-E pizza.Please review your videos from 12:30 to 1pm.
