I have nothing but great things to say about Dr. Walker...although I, like everyone else, don't care for anything dentist related.  But my visit was great.  I had a root canal and their was no pain during or after.  How rare is that?  :)My primary dentist assigned Dr. Walker to give me a root canal.  When I got there, I realized that this was the Stephen Walker who plays hockey with my husband!  Go figure.  Luckily, it was great, so I had nothing to complain about (or any pain) the next time I went to watch his hockey game.
