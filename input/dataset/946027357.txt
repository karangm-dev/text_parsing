Very disappointed with this place. New to the area looking for a nail salon that is clean and provides quality manicures and pedicures.  First and last time to this place.  Did a poor job on the overall quality of my pedicure. Massage was weak at best. Went in here with my boyfriend asked for the deluxe pedicure the lady ended up asking me to go up a level. Which we did not want. However it was hard to understand her so we ended paying more than we were planning for poor service. Only adult beverage they had was red wine. Very disappointed. I would not recommend. Not worth the money.
