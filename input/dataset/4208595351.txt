This place is by far the worst Lab Corp I have ever gone to. We arrived at 6:30am and had quite a line already when it opened at 7:00 everyone was respectful and waited their turn. The chick at the counter looked like she was having a nervous breakdown and was dazed and confused. After finally getting all info into the computer system, it still took 1 1/2 hours to be seen because they only had 1 person drawing blood..are you kidding me??. Once I got in the dude was quick and professional. We had been there once before and was so bad we just left. This location is the closest to our home so that's why we choose this one. We will be looking for a new place to use from now on.
