Cant believe I have never been here until now, its the "place to be" of Ohio City. Everyone was very nice. Hummus and Tabouli were very fresh and good both around 5$. I grew up having lots of Arab friends, I myself am 1/2 Arab and all of their Moms would have Tabouli and Hummus on deck. Point being, I know freshness when I taste it and this is some good stuff! They gave us a whole bag of Pita and they said just take it for the road, which isn't a huge deal, but they could have been cheap and snatched it back up. Baked Kibbee with rice was about 8$, good portion, even better taste.Almost forgot, CASH ONLY!!! I still owe my friend 12$ =-0
