It's impressive how filthy this place is. Someone had puked in the bathroom and there the mess sat for all to see and smell. Aside from that the bathroom condition was dirty everywhere. The floor was sticky in the main part of the restaurant and especially around where I sat. Even the area where the staff hung out, where the drinks were dispensed, was very dirty. You would think the staff would pick up trash from the floor, but no. The only worthwhile feature is that the food is plentiful. The quality ranges from poor to mediocre. There are no more crab legs on Sunday. There is no longer fish to be found at the "sushi-sashimi" bar. It's veggies and rice only (they used to serve fish, at least last time I was here a year or two ago). I will not return to this restaurant, even though you can stuff your gut for $13 if you so wish. That is not my objective. I like to eat someplace clean with better food.
