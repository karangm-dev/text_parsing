First of all, the outside of the building looks like a trap building that exports a hundreds of drugs. It's worn down and all around gross looking. Some of the workers who were clearing tables and refilling the salad bar were dressed like ratchet 13 year olds. Nora's restaurant is definitely not the place to go for dinner unless you're up for an hour wait. I ordered a burger and it took longer to come to the table than my family's fried cod. The tables in Nora's were not all full, yet in the time i would be able to drive back home, make myself my own burger, eat it, drive back to Noras, and have a full whole-hearted conversation with my family, my burger would still not have been ready! The fries are shit and taste like baby food, the pickles tasted like someone blew out their cigarette smoke on them, the chips were some ratchet ass off brand lays potato chips, the swiss cheese on the burger looked like the cook jacked off and cummed all over the bun, and the burger itself made it seem like later at night i'd be shitting my guts out. I'm surprised people still go there since i'm sure my family and i are not the only ones who have experienced this shitty service. I'd rate this place negative stars if i could.
