Im going yesterday for eat a big plate as, and i see the review here before i go so im not  confident, but i think i must to have my own review, and i tell you true this is the best panda express in vegas that i found. Man who work here are nice guys, plate is big and quality is always perfect, you have the speed wifi so its perfect. So try this place for have your own review and dont listen the bad review who are not everytime the good things to judge the place to be.
