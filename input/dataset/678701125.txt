Lifetime WW member but hasn't any success recently with their program; tried Jenny Craig (again) last spring - had used it years ago and loved the  extra support offered by a trained therapist & did well with their program. However, this time? eh. I have long since left processed food behind and the consultant was horrible. Just mentioning all this as my cred.So, I was concerned about the expense and frankly, the medical aspect of RMWL. Hey! I am a happy camper!The staff is always friendly, upbeat, warm and welcoming. I always receive VIP treatment - so, there's never any self-consciousness. Like any business, it's run by humans. The few times when things haven't gone a 100%, they jumped in to make up for it! So, just ask! Speak up!Yes, I am a fan! I am already a healthy eater, so my progress has been slow - actually, maybe 10 pounds the first 6 weeks? So, really, given that I  don't have much to lose, it's right on track!I've learned to see this as a benefit. The PA's are terrific! The place has a wonderful spa feeling to it! I've also been to the Arcadia location and they are just as wonderful there.Oh? The cost? Really, it's very affordable! Less than Jenny Craig for sure! Maybe half the cost? And a better eating plan than WW. I am hopeful that I will get my eating straightened out and make peace with my body.
