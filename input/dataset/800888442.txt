This was my 3rd dining experience, but probably my worst and last. Restaurant was empty and server was far from friendly and accommodating! Never received a refill on beverage, I had to ask. She was tipped over 20% of bill in cash. I then had to ask another server for a to-go cup, and do you think she'd top off my drink? Nope. This place already has changed their opening hours, indicative of slow traffic. With poor service, it's surely not going to last long.Canters CLOSED! BAM! I was spot on, saw it coming long ago.
