For all those negative comments, I'd just like to say something positive on here. I think one of the greatest strengths of NYS is Melanie. For those who can't seem to actually be adults and face things like an adult, I just want people to know that she is a great coordinator. We have returned every year just for soccer and understand that other people may feel different but I see firsthand that many people may disagree. But you should you give it a shot and see for yourself .
