Went here because we heard good things about Mr Chow in other cities, as it turns out yelpers here were fairly accurate- this location is 3 stars at best. Starting with service, there are a ton of suit dummies walking around this place yet the service was average. Server was friendly but we didn't get good vibes. My other problem was with the whole restaurant design. Ugly ass blue carpet in the middle. Looks like they spent a lot on renovating but it looked terribly overpaid for. Felt very tacky. Not to mention the fact that as we were escorted to our table the host stepped on and killed a cockroach nearby one of the VIP rooms beside one of their food carts- we should've just left right then but hey, we already paid for the Groupon.The food was just nothing special at all, very bland. The ribs were ok but needed a lot of their hot sauce, not very tender. Shrimp with walnuts and a yum yum style sauce was heavy and meh. Ginger lobster needed more seasoning to bring out more flavor. Shrimp fried rice was so bland we laughed about how easy it is to make it better at home. Cheesecake was standard.Overall would not recommend this place to anyone. It's overpriced crappy bland Chinese food. Felt like take out but we were served by tuxedos.If they serve fried cockroaches on the menu that I was unaware of I will accept the fact that we saw a dead one on the way to our table.2/5 , and I think that's generous
