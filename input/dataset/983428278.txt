I haven't had the awning long enough to know if it will last. The problem is, they took it down last fall when it was new and have ignored my post card dates as well as three phone call pleas to put it back up in time for an important party. I selected dates 6 weeks in advance of the party and wrote a note on the card (as instructed). All to no avail. They can't tell me when I will have my awning or even where it is. The weather has not been an issue. Very poor customer service. The post card dates are a joke. Update-subsequent year's have not been an issue.
