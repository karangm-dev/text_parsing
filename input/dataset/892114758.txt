I would recommend this child care center. The staff is friendly, the environment is clean and my kids are always engaged in fun learning activities. The main room leads are well educated in caring for the children and show compassion and care in their interaction with the kids.  Prior to this, my kids attended a daycare on a military facility and I loved the security features they had. When I toured this facility, I loved the fact that they too offer video security system. I can log in from any computer and see what is going on in my kids classroom. There are cameras in each room and even tv screens in the main lobby that show what is going on in each room also. This provided me with extra reassurance that my kids would be safely cared for. They also offer video system on their play-areas.  It is not a stand alone building, however, it is right next to Larry Lake Gymnastics, Black Mountain Dental and Taco Bell. This location has met not only our daycare needs, but these surrounding facilities have been equally as great to meeting our families needs.
