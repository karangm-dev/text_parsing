I just left this location. I have been coming to this location for the last 2 years. Although I haven't been in a couple months my husband and I decided to get our usual smoothie and sandwich for dinner. They have new staff that doesn't seem to know what's on the menu. I asked for the turkey bacon ranch that comes on the ciabatta bread and the girl told me they don't use that bread. She asked the owner and the owner said yes they do. So then we always hey no sweetners and no sugar, once we drank our smoothies they tasted very sweet. I asked what they use to make it sweet and the owner said juice. So a few minutes later I decided to order another one because mine was to sweet. I asked the girl at the register to not use juice and only use water, she told me she cannot do that. Not sure why she can't make a change and just add water. Ridiculous!! I have always enjoyed the owner, she is a hard worker, but this new staff is clueless. We will have to go to another tropical smoothie.
