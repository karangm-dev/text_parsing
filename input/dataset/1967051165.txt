I question how on this burrito-loving earth it's possible to serve food 1) so delicious and fresh 2) so reasonably priced 3) in such generous portions... It's a mystery I keep going back to investigate! A sanctuary for authentic, flavorful food lovers, sweet plantain fiends, and the really hungry people coming down from the rush of Strip District shopping, this festively decorated space is bright and inviting... Essentially, the effect is like walking into a fiesta.The portions suggest you could definitely share an entree; However, you probably won't want to. Go extra hungry and you MIGHT be able to polish off one of the massive burritos.I'm personally very into the bright green sauce you can request for your grub. USE CAUTION, it is the special kind of hot that sneaks up on you and embraces you in a tongue-numbing hug. If you like that sort of thing, you can get a container for home.  There's so much to love at Chicken Latino, absolutely give this hidden gem a try next time you're in the Strip!
