First time there, only one waitress for the whole restaurant, her attitude wasn't nice to our table, but she smiled to all the other customers...., then when we got the bill and paid for it, she came back and told us that the bill hasn't included tips...  we had already left 10% on the tray, what was that about???  Asking for more tips???   Her attitude made us didn't want to leave any at all, but we did anyways!
