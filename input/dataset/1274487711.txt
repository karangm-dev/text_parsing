My favorite omakase sushi spot! Standard omakase is 105, upgrading to the premium sashimi platter is an additional $25. If you're sitting at the bar, would recommend upgrading so you don't feel left out! Small, intimate restaurant with limited number of seats, and clean and minimalist design. The focus is on the fish and the nigiri (which it should be), chefs and waitresses are attentive and friendly. If you've ever watched Jiro Dreams of Sushi, it's a similar style - the chef places the nigiri at the bar and you're meant to eat it almost immediately. The fish is extremely fresh, the waitress show you photos of what they look like, and some dishes are seasonal (ie. firefly squid in the spring). There is no choice of what you receive, but you can notify the waitress beforehand of allergies. Personal favorites are the monkfish liver, firefly squid, and the fluke! Having been 1-2 times over the past year or so, I've noticed they are starting to add more dishes at the beginning (ie. sashimi platter, striped jack fish miso soup, salmon roe and negitoro on rice), which filled me up fairly quickly compared to what it used to be, of simply 18 pieces of nigiri. Make reservations at least 1-2 weeks in advance, and make sure to show up on time!
