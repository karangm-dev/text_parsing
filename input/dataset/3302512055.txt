Metro Center USED to be a happening and hip place to hang out!! They had an ice skating rink, video games, lots of food choices, including upper end restaurants, a movie theater, and OPEN stores!!!!This entire area has gone to crap!!! So sad to see Metro Center in the condition that it currently is in. There is no turning back to the "good old days" for this mall because the entire area surrounding the mall has transformed, and NOT in a good way!!! I remember when we were teenagers and did the "cool" thing that teenagers did in the day wherein we would cruise the perimeter of the mall on Friday and Saturday nights. I remember when we went ice skating for hours. I remember when we played video games for hours. I remember when we ate at the food court (LOTS of choices) and ate at the sit-down restaurants. I remember when you didn't need to 'pack' to feel safe in or around the mall like you do now. I remember when Metrocenter was alive and well!!! Look it up online. You won't believe how amazing Metrocenter once was...and now is NOT!!!
