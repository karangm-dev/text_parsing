For a salon that specializes in COLOURING, these people don't know what they're doing and the place itself seemed pretty much like a joke. I read many good reviews before deciding to come here, but I wish I had read the good and bad ones beforehand. The people who worked here were friendly but listening to them talk almost 3 hours about the Kardashians and their jibber jabber gave me a headache and probably killed a few brain cells. The owner seemed nice and was the one who mixes the all dyes and colouring. He listened to me and was understanding. Having said that, I came here to dye my hair blonde and gave them a very thorough description of what I wanted...but somehow I walked out with ORANGE. The colour was 200% off. They all kept telling me how nice it looked once it was done but I could see it in their faces that they were as shocked as I was. I had get it redone at another salon after I explained to them my horrible experience here.I should also mention that I had to blowdry and style my OWN hair after the final wash. You would think that after dishing out over $120 for a colour job, someone would be able to blowdry it for you (especially when there are 4 employees and I was the only client.) But they just handed me a comb and blowdryer at the "style station" while they watched me do it myself. Ridiculous. Never again.
