Went here tonight for the first time with friends, will not be back. Sat at the bar for almost 10 minutes before bartender even acknowledged us. Once we were seated it was fine  waiter was nice, took our order right away, but once the food came it was a different story. Someone else brought our food, my friend and I ordered fajitas and we're not given our tortillas. It took 10 to 15 minutes before I was able to flag down our waiter to ask for them, when he brought the tortillas back we told him that our meal  hot and he offered to "reheat" them... we declined, as our other friends had almost finished their meals.  He never asked us if we wanted another round of drinks. He brought the bill and didn't take anything off our bill or offer free desert to compensate. I asked for the manager who listened, apologized, and said he'd adjust the bill; our waiter brought the bill back telling us he had taken $5 off each of our meals.  As we were leaving, the manager came back to offer us a $10 off coupons. We turned them down because we felt disappointed in how they handled our situation...why would we want to come to back here?!
