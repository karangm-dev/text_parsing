We went here after buying the DealFind voucher. We ordered the duck salad, pumpkin soup, spring rolls, mango chicken, and two drinks.Pumpkin soup was great - nice and coconutty; great flavour! Spring rolls were your run-of-the-mill spring rolls. Duck was kind of tough and salad was your average lettuce, tomato, and mushrooms, but drowned in Thai dressing. The dressing itself was tasty, but overwhelmed the entire dish. Mango chicken had an odd taste like bad sweet-and-sour, and like the salad, was drowned in sauce.Total bill (before discount voucher) came to about $55 for two people. Not overly-expensive, but also not particularly cheap. Will return at least once, as I bought a second voucher, so they've got another chance to impress. Overall, not a *bad* Thai place, but not a great one either. There are definitely tastier and cheaper places you could go.
