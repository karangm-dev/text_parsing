My husband and I frequently visit Sammie's on Sahara about 4 times a week,  considering we are night owls we spend most of our time in the tavern. We really enjoy the bar staff! Cher and Kat  always remember our drink orders, make us feel welcome and immediately ask us if we want to order any food. We are always informed about the current player promotions and really enjoy spending our Free time at Sammie's with them. I suggest that everyone goes to Sammie's has a drink and orders the hummus!
