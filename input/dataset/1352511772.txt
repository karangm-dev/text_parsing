LAst January my Daughter got married at the Castle.  When we got there at the specified time for our rehearsal the only person who was there was the owner as there was a bridal show going on in Phoenix that weekend.  The wedding planner who was supposed to be helping us wasn't there and we had to wait almost an hours for the "Owner" to get to us...she was showing the venue to prospective clients.   She completely rushed thru the process verbally in approximately ten to fifteen minutes and  there was not a run thru at all.  When I questioned things she rudely informed me that she had "done this hundreds of times and don't worry!"  The next day when we got there to set up she was, again, giving a tour while leaving us waiting and not knowing what was going on. She didn't know ANYTHING!  She thought the wedding was going to be outdoors when it was planned to be indoors so she had to scrammble to push the tables apart.  The whole affair felt thrown together and she was not helpful at all!  My daughter got a lot of promises with very little delivery.   The guests made the event and the joy of the occasion overshadowed the debacle that was Ashley Manor!  Go somewhere else would be my suggestion...you can get pretty pictures lots of places!
