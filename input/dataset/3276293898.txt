Friendly service and the food is EXACTLY like the other Naked City locations. Wings are damn near perfect, and you can't go wrong with the Grandmas Meatball pizza!!!Reasonably priced, good old fashioned pizza just like from back home in northeast PA. It's even delicious cold out of the fridge the next day :) FANTASTIC all around!!!
