Went here for lunch with the family.  We got the flatbread pizza, shrimp poboy and the burger.  Everything was great but our favorite was the burger and fries...WOW!!!!  Probably one of the best burgers we've ever had.  Environment was upscale (I don't dress trendy enough to fit in there, haha) and staff were friendly and responsive.  We'll be back
