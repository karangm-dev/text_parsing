I get mani/pedis, waxing and lashes. The technicians are professional and friendly. The salon is clean and trendy. If it wasn't for the receptionists at the front desk (or should back desk), I may have given a 5 star review. I have to say that I've never encountered such a rude, unfriendly, caustic group of women. I've been told that this is a common complaint and that the owner knows, but doesn't care.
