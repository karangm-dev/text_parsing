TODAYS MENU 2 INCHES LONG STICKY DOG HAIR ALL OVER YOU. we have just rented car again near kingston rd ,beaches, and it was again full with at least 2 inches long dog hair, zipcar messaged us that the car has been cleaned  and we were happy to book the car,but how has it been cleaned??? I took pics and will attach soon, they forgot to clean the backseat where I sat with my toddler, again I have to wash all our garments since long pet hairs cause allergic reaction to many people, itching for example but main concern is hygiene, we are going to appointments, what will people think of us if we show up in dirty outfits, my spouse wears expensive wool suits at his work and dry cleaning is not cheap to have 3x a week just because of some loser's filthy mongrel. dont have a pet if you can not keep it clean, or take ur @ss for a walk. period.if ur 5 min late 30 bucks fine, if u dont refill the tank much morebut if ur smelly drooling pet spoils other customers trip then its no charge, and that low life son of a cockroach keeps laughing behind our back as zipcar never fines him/her, its been going on for weeks now, always the same area and same cars we book, if i attach the pics i took you will vomit 4sure
