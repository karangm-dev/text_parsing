Pan Asian is in my opinion hands down the best Asian food restaurant that Vegas has to offer. It's a little hidden gem that hardly ever seems busy but wow! The food is great, I keep going back to either the Pad Thai or the fried rice, they are both fantastic! The service is phenomenal and the owner is almost always in the restaurant and knows many of his customers by face, if not name. Be ware though, when they say spicy..they mean SPICY! A spicy level 2 there is comparable to a 5 at other Asian places..so a 10 is hot hot hot! Definitely my favorite Thai restaurant by far!
