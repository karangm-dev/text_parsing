Please please please read the other reviews. Made reservation two weeks in advance. When we arrived at the counter we were greeted by a gangsta-wannabe agent slumped in a chair. First he couldn't locate our reservation. When he found it he says "did you bring your utility bill?" What? He says that we should have read the website . The entire website? "No you just have to click on terms and conditions and read through the ones for this location" At this point we just laughed and walked away. Went next door and paid 25 bucks more. Well worth it to not have to listen to a mumble-mouth agent whose only job appears to be looking like he's sitting in a lounge chair getting customers out of his hair.
