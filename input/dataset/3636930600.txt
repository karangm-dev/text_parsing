I give this place only two stars. The food is not bad, except that it's too flavourful. So unless you are really used to the strong flavours, you may not enjoy the food a lot. Now coming to the ambience part of the restaruant, I think this is one of the worst places. Looks very unhygenic and even the waiter and waitress here don't know how to attend to the customers. They constantly drop the silverware and I've noticed that they don't sanitize the cutlery and plates properly, which leads to a big hygiene issue. I would not recommend this place to anyone! Ever!
