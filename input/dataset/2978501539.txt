The Rail does a lot of things right. The food is fresh, well-priced, and tasty. The restaurant itself is very nice, with a bar separating the booths and tables from the patio area; this makes access to drinks very convenient. I will say, though, that the service really hits it out of the park! Happy hour is great and on top of that they also have a specially priced drink all day for particular days of the week. For instance, Long Island Iced Teas are $3 all day on Fridays. Honestly, the only thing I would change is the a la carte sides...I think it's unAmerican to serve a burger without fries. Keep up the good work Rail, I love ya.
