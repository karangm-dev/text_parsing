Don't. Just don't. Without going into every detail, I arranged to buy a car and finance through this dealership one night while looking around with a friend. Good deal on a restored salvage title. Warranty thrown in to be included with financing. Went back the next night with down payment and required paperwork. Minus the male friend, the price of the vehicle went up $2500, the warranty was not included in the down payment, which had to be dropped to pay for the warranty separately. The payments went up, and the loan lengthened by 6 mo. He even jacked the interest by 1%. I may not be all that experienced when it comes to car finance, but I know that when a restored salvage is all of a sudden being sold at above Kelley BB prices, it's time to walk. Oh, by the way, the original contract, that one that was valid, disappeared. The staff told me I'd lost it but it was actually with the owner, even though he said he wasn't holding it. He finally "discovered" it among his papers when I insisted that I had put it down and not picked it up.
