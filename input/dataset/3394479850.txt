Do not bring your kids here. I took my daughter here for her first hair cut. Her hair was uneven on one side because she twirls her hair. It was still several inches long--long enough to curl. I asked for the back to be evened out and then for layers. Having had curly hair my whole life--that's generally how it works. Pick a length--add layers. I asked for a side part with long bangs. During the cut the stylist kept saying, do you want it even? Well, yes. So the end result is that the stylist cut all of my girl's gorgeous curls down to about an inch--it isn't long enough to curl. I barely made it out of the salon before I started crying. My kid (she's two) is also upset because her hair is much too short to twirl, which is her main way to self sooth. I have serious fears she won't be able to fall asleep. So the horrendous cut aside. We weren't greeted when we walked in. Had to wait several minutes for a stylist--everyone was in the back room, not working on other clients. The stylist took forever to get set up. She didn't know how to turn the TV on and while there were several stylist mulling around, no one helped. My husband had to do it. The stylist kept stopping the cut for various reasons--once to tell me about her dog. I would think a place that caters to kids would know the importance of hustling.I'm just going to take my daughter to my stylist from now on with an IPad and save us all a lot of trauma. For now, I'm just repeating, it is just hair. It will grow back--it only took her two years to grow it.
