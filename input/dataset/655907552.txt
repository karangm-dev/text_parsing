All in few words .Not clean , hallways ; carpets.  Besides not sure about how managment handles asigning rooms. Two nights in a row there were like 50 kids plus  parents . Kids running all over places and parent drinking beer on the hallway and all with deaf problems because they were yelling not talking until 3 am  . Anyhow we called the front  desk  and they didn't care.  Anyhow an advise for everyone.. ask before they give you a room so you won't be having a terrible nigh.
