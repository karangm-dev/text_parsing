This review is difficult to write because it is so mixed.  The floral department is one of the best.  Greg in the meat department is extremely helpful, the management there is horrible.  The store certainly does not represent what Safeway should stand for.  I live in Goodyear part of the year and in San Ramon, California part of the year, they have a state-of-the-art store in San Ramon, one which would rival any speciality grocery store, so I know they can do it, the one in Goodyear is just horrible by conparison.  Often the food is even old.  The people are generally nice, but the management of Safeway needs to do a major update here and fix this store.
