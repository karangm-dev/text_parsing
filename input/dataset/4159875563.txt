I visited Waffles Cafe while recently in town after finding this place through Yelp. I saw that the reviews were "okay" so decided to give it a chance but unfortunately, the food was really bad. There are a a variety of menu options; which I thought was a good thing but my meal left a lot to be desired. My friend and I decided to split an order of chicken and a waffle. Do NOT order this! The "chicken" was a serving of frozen chicken fingers aka not real chicken and the waffle was completely bland. Thank God for the strawberry butter they gave me to spread onto my waffle because it made it edible. It's unfortunate that I can't rate this place higher because the atmosphere inside is truly adorable and their staff was outstanding. Everyone I came in contact with was extremely friendly and helpful and they all were wearing a smile; which was really refreshing. I liked the idea of this place much more than I liked the actual food but for the most part, I enjoyed my experience there, thanks to the great staff. One really cool thing that I liked was the wall of names, sayings, etc... Tip: If you ask the server to use the label maker, she'll print off your name or whatever you like for you to stick on the wall. As a tourist, I thought that was a nice touch.
