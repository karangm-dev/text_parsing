I attended an event at this restaurant. I was a little early, so I grabbed a salad while waiting. They have a reloadable wine card you can purchase. Tip: If you're an avid wine drinker, $20 and if you are not, $10. I also ate the Chicken Alfredo Cone (half), it was a little bland but nothing salt couldn't fix. We were told that they have specials during the week. I would frequent this establishment again in the near feature.
