I called an hour before I was planning on stopping by the restaurant to make a reservation and the staff accommodated my needs quickly. I changed my reservation twice and they made it work. Mind you it was memorial day weekend and the restaurant was very busy. We ended up being seated after five minutes of waiting. We were greeted by the waiter and he was really friendly. He managed to tell us about the different kind of sakis. Unfortunately, we did not end up ordering it. We ended up ordering beers instead. To start off my palette, I order the miso soup which was made with cilantro instead of seaweed. It was a nice surprise and different from the generic miso soup. I would definitely order it again. I stumbled upon the yellowtail taquitos on the menu and made sure to order that. It was fantastic. Although they do need to change the name to tacos because it could be misleading. The fish melted in your mouth. The combination of flavors was exquisite. After I order a tuna cut roll and it was mouthwatering. The quality of the fish was fresh and tasty. I was very full after that and did not end up ordering dessert. They seemed to have great options. Overall, I was very satisfied. I would definitely come here again and recommend this sushi place to anybody.
