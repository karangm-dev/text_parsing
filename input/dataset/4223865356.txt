DAS was just fine. Moved my Jeep from Colorado to Nevada and it arrived two days before they estimated it would, which was nice for me. Nothing was stolen from it (although if anything were, it would've been my responsibility). The lady at the location I dropped it off at was very friendly. I would use them again if I needed to and I could.
