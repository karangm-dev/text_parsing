So I went in here a few weeks back to mail out something I had sold on ebay...I was in a hurry on my way home from work and saw the sign on Scottsdale road and thought what the heck, I don't live in the area, and I have no clue where a Post office is around here, and I needed to ship it that day.I walked in and there was a few customers in front of me, but being helped in different areas of the counter. So I walked up to an open area, and stood there for a few minutes with my package not even being acknowledged...finally when I did get helped, The kid who helped me wasn't very polite. I guess my biggest complaint was the fact that the shipping was about $20 for my package...wouldn't normally complain but I want to say that something fishy was going on with there pricing I think they over charged me, when I got home to add the tracking # eBay said it should of only cost about $14 to ship the item via UPS based of the dimensions and the weight.I did say something about it in the store and the kid just kind of snickered looked at the other gentleman and said Ebay...like there was some joke about it. So I think this place has some shady business practices but I can't be certain...in any event it was a one time stop I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone based on that alone.
