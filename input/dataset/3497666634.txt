If I have to rate zero star, I would!  Veggies are 3/4 yellows,  egg plant hot pot and won ton soup noodles are tasteless,  have to add hot sause and soy sause to eat.  They gave us BBQ pork end burn piece.  We don't even feel any AC on while it is over 100 degree outside.  Want to know more?  6 dishes cost $97.  Charge us $12 tips for 5 people dining.  Ridiculous over charge for bad service.  DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE.
