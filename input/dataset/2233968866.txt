I went through the drive thru on last Sunday Afternoon. They had a new fellow at the restaurant and he was learning. He is not reason for post . He took my credit card to pay and it was taking a long time more then 3 min and did not come back and I got worried. I got worried and honked . The manager opened the window. I asked what going on with my card and he said if I did not like it I can go somewhere else. Very rude  and handed back my card . This was not even about the food. This was about protecting my information from being written down.   I explained that and he did not think it was a big  deal. Never apologized. Tried calling owner and same supervisor picked up phone.
