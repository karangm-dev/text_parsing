I am so sad that I may be moving back to LA now that I've discovered Raw Food Express, I'm seriously considering living in Vegas "part-time"...if that even makes sense. Whatever, I'll figure it out.After reviewing the menu online and having my mind set on the BlackJack 21 Salad, I drove a few blocks down to the Cafe. I was immediately greeted enthusiastically by Xavier and then Rosa took care of my order. When I realized how small the container for the salad was, I was a bit worried that I wouldn't be satisfied. Rosa insisted that it may look small, but the various, nutritious contents will keep my stomach (and brain) happy. However, she also cheerfully gave me samples of a few other items if I wanted to try anything else, just in case. 5 samples later...Damn. I am definitely coming back for the tacos, mock chicken salad wraps, zucchini wraps, and the macaroons. I ended up taking home the Blackjack 21 and Labenese Salad, both delicious but I can't take my mind off of the taco sample Rosa slipped me...curses! I'll be back.p.s. You can tell everyone here is very passionate about the raw food lifestyle. Xavier chatted a few customers up, including me, about his own weight loss experience (215lbs to 140lbs I believe he said) by cutting out animal products and including his WoRx smoothies in his diet, and the foundation of the food and philosophy of the place. He is patient with everyone's questions and answers every curious inquiry thoroughly.
