2 visits, 2 stars.  OK, so for the good and the not-so-good:I had eaten here for a late lunch and had the Tom Yum / Shrimp Seafood soup and hot tea.  I liked that you can control the spice level of the soup from 1 - 10.  The soup tasted very good, and very fresh too.  I left feeling very satisfied.  And, I liked the decorum and presentation of the place.  Its location is very convenient, near Summerlin right by the movie theater.I liked this place enough, that I decided to head back several days later for another lunch.  I wanted to try one of their salads.  Before I ordered, I went to the restroom.  A worker from the kitchen was using the restroom at the same time, and I noticed that he did not  seem to wash his hands after.   While it is possible he might have washed his hands in the kitchen after he left, it is certainly not something I wish to speculate about nor think about when eating.  I would have said something to the waitress, but she was busy. I ended up leaving without ordering anything, and it is highly unlikely I will ever return.
