Located in a strip mall on Tropicana, you'd hope that you've found some kind of local gem when you walk into the restaurant.The inside is quite cute. There is a stone facade on all the walls so you feel like you're dining in a cave. I was brought here under the pretense that the food here is as good as Lotus of Siam.Um. WRONG.I ordered the crispy duck and it was soooooo freakin' dry. The flavor was there... but it'd be like ordering a succulent roast duck in the window of your favorite chinese restaurant- and then leaving outside in the sun for 2 days, then serving it on a plate here at this restaurant.We also ordered a chicken dish with a coconut curry. The sauce was good, but again... the chicken was over cooked and dry! That's AFTER having been smothered in sauce! Good god!My waitress didn't understand my question when I asked her to "please describe the crispy duck to me?" Well... actually, she understood me but she was so sincere and smiled, "it's a duck. It's crispy. It has a sauce on the side.""What's the sauce made of?'"Um. It's brown or... no, black. And it's um.... um.... people like it!"Sigh.I wish I hadn't ordered it.The staff seems nice, but they're not trained in the menu and they're really just glorified bussersI hear the coconut soup here is good.I'm not sure I'll ever get back here to try it though.The good points of this place is that management seemed nice and the decor inside is quirky. .
