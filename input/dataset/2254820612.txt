Appalling service.   A cruise was booked and we were trying  to arrange an early departure from the cruise due to a change in plans.  It took far too many e-mails and calls back and forth with the customer service contact to get a straight answer.     The customer service  person was  rude and snippy, has an attitude,  and demonstrates  no interest in helping customers. She could not care less that we were  upset and stressed about the situation.  I would never, ever, use this company again, it was a very negative experience.
