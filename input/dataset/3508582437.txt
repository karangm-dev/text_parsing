Came here because I was looking for a hockey bar and some of the reviews said this was the place to go. Um, no. That wasn't the case. I would have asked if she could turn one on, but after she gave me my first beer when I arrived I was pretty much ignored and the place was dead. They had a lot of TVs showing the same 2 college football games. Pretty standard otherwise. No different than a PTs or Lodge.  Couldn't say how the food was. Didn't stick around. Won't be back.
