Got brow extensions here- and they were so awful, the customer service I received afterwards was even worse. I had to take them all off once I got home, she never cleaned off my eyebrows to begin with and glued the hairs directly on my eyebrows, not my skin. They were going in all different directions and falling off. They looked extremely fake which is not what the pictures looked like. I couldn't brush my eyebrows or even try to fill them in a little to hide how they looked because they were literally HARD. You could see the glue everywhere. It felt like I just took a bunch of plastic eyebrow hairs and soaked them in elmers glue and pressed them randomly onto my eyebrows. I texted the lady who did them afterwards, she was very nice while doing them, but she wouldn't give me a refund or even a partial refund and I had to take them all off, which ripped out some of my real eyebrow hairs! Big waste of money.
