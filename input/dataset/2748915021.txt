Was disappointed to hear from my friend that Lesco will no longer tint your existing glasses to make sunglasses out of them.  These glasses had no coatings on the lenses and they have always done this before.  They only offered to sell him a new pair starting at $69 ...all the way up to $149 for polarized lenses.
