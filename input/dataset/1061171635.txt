Been going here for years because my wife seems to like ketchup topped matzo with way too much cheese.  They have always had bad service, but this last (and final time) was the worst.  The kid, who seems to charge something different every time, even though we always order the same thing takes my order.  He repeats the wrong order back to me, and I correct him.  When I get back home low and behold we have the wrong pie.  Well I call up expecting them to make a new pizza or at least make the half they got wrong in a smaller size.  I get crickets.  The kid says I should have told him when he repeated the order back to me.  I explained that is what happened and he thinks I am lying to him.  Trying to remind him that I order there all the time does nothing for this kid.  My wife has to be the only regular this place has I have never seen anyone in there besides this kid and the owner.  I ask him to contact the owner and see what he thinks they should do.After a while on hold it turns out I am out of luck on this pie, and I will have to get "a deal" on my next one.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?  My wife won't eat this thing you made it wrong.  And like I said its for her because I hate this place. In the end I am going to have to cancel the credit card purchase and battle it out there.  This place is a joke and can't even make a good pie!
