The $20.13 3 course lunch was amazing. The fish lovraki, salmon, lobster pasta was all cooked to perfection. The octopus was amazing, never had such tender octopus. The bread to dip in olive oil was so good, crunchy crust. Real rustic bread.I have nothing bad to say about this restaurant including the service. All 5 stars.The yogurt martini dessert was a perfect ending. I didn't think I was gonna get full from the pictures i saw but I did.******Tips*****1. lunch starts at 12pm ends at 2:30pm you need to get in by 2pm. They shut the restaurant between end of lunch and dinner. Business casual dress2. reservation is not needed for lunch but I recommend it, as its getting popular for their lunch special.3. Even tho their lunch special for 3 courses is $20.13, some of the items are supplemental meaning you need to pay extra. The octopus everyone is raving about is $10 more on top of the $20.13,  and  the lobster pasta is $15 more. The extra price is well worth is.4. In my opinion the Greek yogurt martini is the best dessert unless you don't like yogurt, I was told its made in house. Its very rich and creamy. The thickest yogurt I've ever had. Slight tang with a touch of sweetness.I payed $120 for 3 people for lunch. That included the octopus appetizer and the lobster pasta that we had to pay extra for.
