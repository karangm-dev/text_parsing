We go to the original location 15414 N.19th Ave, a lot. I thought we would give the new location 1825 W. Chandler Blvd, a try for the most part the food was as good.Service on the other hand was more then lacking. Nothing like the original location, 8 employees and felt like none wanted to take the order or help/answer questions about the menu.One of the employees was more interested in the cookie she was eating while bagging the others for customers then waiting on anyone. Another coming out in to the dining room to eat and still wearing his gloves he used to serve food in the kitchen then back into the kitchen without changing the gloves.General cleanliness also lacking, dirty vents and pipes over head, leaking air vent over soda area.In the future we will be going back to the original location.
