Dropped my computer off to the Repairs dept. to replace my liquid cooling system. Got it back after 1 day which was nice, but after two days of use my graphics card died. I thought, "Okay, might just be wear and tear" so I swapped to a back up GPU that was the same model and after 30 minutes of gaming, THIS GPU DIED TOO!! 2 separate graphics cards, one well used (the other lightly used) dying within such a short time frame after repair?I can only imagine that when installing my new liquid cooling system they must've shorted my motherboard somewhere and caused my gpu's to fry. (Guess that's why they call it Fry's)They have a 30-day return policy with repairs and upgrades so I dropped it back off to them 2 days ago but havent heard from them since. I tried calling in for an update but the three times I tried the operator told me that the phone systems were down. It would be nice to get an update, guys. Please, if anyone from Fry's is reading this can you please call me at 702-419-6363 to get me an update on my PC repair?
