Eating vegetarian there is just not that exciting to me...I've eaten enough hummus in my life that it's no longer exotic or unique to get a plate of plain hummus with some pita. Maybe for others hummus is still exciting?I had their blueberry shake a few years ago and thought it was wonderful but got heartburn afterwards, so I've never tried it again. I would recommend it though. It's made from yogurt and blueberries (I can no longer tolerate cow yogurt). I like their tofu scrambles too.I would have given it three stars if not for the last experience I had here at the indian school location. I got the salad, on special and thought it was too acidic and needed some protein to mellow it out...like nuts. About halfway through (because I'm distracted by feeding my child), I remember that the menu said it came with pine nuts. I stop eating and try to flag down the server. About five minutes later (not kidding...poor service) when I'm about to just walk to the kitchen window myself, the server sees me. I explain it to him and he goes to the kitchen with my plate. They say they did put nuts on it. I said, no they didn't. And then they say they did and they're sorry, but they can't give me more. ???Yes, now you all know that either I have short-term memory loss or I like to lie to get lots of pine nuts because I have a pine nut addiction and I just HAVE to have them and will go so far as to lie to my waiter to get them. Wtf.I didn't eat anymore of the salad. I lose my appetite when people falsely accuse me of lying (especially about pine nuts). I don't need to go back to Pita Jungle. The hummus was overrated anyway! I can just go to the Mediterranean deli on 16th st!
