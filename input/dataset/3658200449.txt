I have a good time here. I was kind of upset that my previous dentist left. I walked in one day for a medical visit and the whole office was different. I wish they would have sent an email or something letting me know. I like the new Dr. He explains everything and I have not had any issues with him. The staff is really nice. I hate the dentist and they make it easier to be there, so I am thankful for them.
