We went here on a Thursday night for some wings and beer. I guess we had a waitress as evidenced by the fact that some menus were thrown on the table, but I ordered the food at the bar and spent the night walking back and forth for pitchers of beer (it was funny at first but got old quick)  we did not see the waitress until we were getting about ready to leave... she came by and asked us how we were doing! I have had crappy service before, but never non-existent. Anyways the bartender was very friendly, I wouldn't go back though, there are SO many of the exact same bar by different names where a waitress will actually bring the beer to your table for you.
