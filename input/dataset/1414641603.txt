The food is delicious but.....the service is terrible. We had a reservation and still waited 15 minutes for our table. Then it took an hour for chips and guacamole as well as our drinks. Here's the bad part- when we complained we received a very apathetic and unconcerned response. They gave us 50% off but never once apologized. From the hosts to the manager it felt like no one cared if we had a positive experience. For the price and the competition you've got to do better than that! I won't be back
