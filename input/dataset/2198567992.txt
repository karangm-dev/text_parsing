I am writing this review waaaay too late. Been going to the a Wright Bar at the Biltmore for probably 4 years when visiting our son in the Biltmore area. Well, now he's moving to San Diego. We went to the Bar last weekend for a Bon voyage drink. The bartenders are very friendly and super helpful (I.e. Like when you lose your phone!). Drinks are a bit pricey but very good!! The ambience is classic-recently renovated! Some nights we've been there, we have enjoyed live music. The bar is always hopping-great for people watching! Good-bye, dear Wright Bar. Hopefully, I'll make it back some day!
