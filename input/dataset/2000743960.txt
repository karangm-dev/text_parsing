Waiter disappeared for the whole dining experience before we even got our food. Was told happy hour appetizers were half off then they tried to charge full price.Food tasted ok but an hour after we got back into our room we were sick as dogs. Had to stay in our hotel room instead of going out that night. The next day we overheard a group of four say they were all throwing up and I asked why, surprise surprise they all got sick after eating there too. Update got home to realize they double charged us for our meal lol it just gets better and better.
