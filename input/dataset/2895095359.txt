I honestly love this place. I have been coming here for years and even after moving to southern highlands, I still drive here to take my pug. I use the self wash stations. They are super easy to use and there's no clean up necessary! I've tried other dog wash places but I always come back here. Thank you barking dogs for a continued awesome experience!
