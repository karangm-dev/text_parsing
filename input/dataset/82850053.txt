The highlight of this place is that you can customize your burger with a large selection of normal and exotic meats and toppings (ie. Elk,Duck, etc). I was excited to try my wild boar burger, but it was disappointing. The meat tasted incredibly dry and the bread left a stale feeling in my mouth. Our server was attentive for the first little bit but disappeared midway through our meal. Although I don't like going to another server, I had to ask our neighbouring table's server for more water to wash out the over greasy taste of their fries. I should have gone to the Works instead!
