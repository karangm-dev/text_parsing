The space is nice - good for pairs or groups, conducive to a happy hour, a date, or an evening with friends. Music is a bit loud for good conversation. The drink list of beers and wines has a good variety with options for all tastes. The food menu is almost entirely snacks. We had the cracker jax (peanuts and popcorn with a caramelized crunch - tasty and a generous portion), the burrata (typical burrata, good and enough for two to share), the cheese pretzel (oily and over-baked with an unpleasantly pungent cheese melted on it served beside unappetizing pickled Brussels sprouts), and a steak special (delicious and sufficient for two to share). I'd come back again based on most of the food, except the service was not good. The two servers were borderline unfriendly and inattentive. It took 10 minutes to get one beer, our food came out very slowly and oddly paced, and we had to flag down the servers for any requests despite sitting directly in front of them at the bar. It felt like our presence was an inconvenience and they could not have cared less that we were there.
