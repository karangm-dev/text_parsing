Unbelievably bad even for a taco Bell. The teenagers working here clearly don't give a f@&k.  How does 'extra hot sauce' equal NO hot sauce?  The girl that is repeatedly at the window has gigantic fake nails that are strictly against Dane county health code (I know because I run a food establishment).  I know, it's taco Bell, but this is a down grade even to that low standard...
