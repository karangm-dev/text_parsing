If you are in a hurry, DO NOT use the online pre-order feature! I purposely placed my order for a hour after they opened as to avoid the unorganized crunch of any store opening. Due to a broken ankle I had to call Uber anx got there 15 minutes after the time I requested the order be ready. 2 customers in the place, and already seated, so they were not busy at all. When I asked about my order, I was looked at like ' Huh'. Order wasnt even started. So as I'm paying an Uber driver to sit and wait, 10 minutes later(for 2 damn sushi burritos), I finally get my order. 3 people behind the counter and 2 of them stood and watched as the 3rd, and very apparent brand new person, struggled to put together the order.What a waste of damn time! The only reason that I'm giving 2 stars is that the fish was cold and the ingredient mix I chose was killer. Mango, Cream Cheese, Ahi & Yum Yum Sauce is the ticket!
