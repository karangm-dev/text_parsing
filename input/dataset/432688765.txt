Everything was great but how does a brand new place run out of food when it just recently opened and it is trying to get loyal customers. Half of the things they promote is their food and for them to not be serving it, and without any sign of notice until I got to the register is extremely disappointing. The staff seemed extremely all over the place and the person yelling out order numbers was being overly aggressive when calling them out.
