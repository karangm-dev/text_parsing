This place is not the buizness. I got tacos which I can't believe were $7. Whathehell we live in AZ tacos are like cactus here......everywhere!!!!!!! So as I'm sitting there surrounded by hella white ppl I'm thinking why am I here. My niece didn't even like her chicken tacos, how does a kid not like tacos. That was a wrap for me but my friend keeps telling me it's not the tacos it's the enchiladas. I don't know if I can do it again. Buena suerte?
