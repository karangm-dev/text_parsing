I've tried this place 3 times and every time I hope that it would blow me away,  but alas, not the case.  I went there for dinner the day before Valentine's Day. We were seated by the window, which was kind of cold so I kept my jacket with me.  It took us a solid 5 mins to go through the wine binder and consult with the waiter before deciding on a gamay.  When it showed up, we were told the wine is a bit cold.  I had to warm it up in my hands.Ordered the food, appetizers were promising, carrot soup and mussels, good stuff.But sometimes its the little things that add up, like cold hard butter with bread.  They brought around candles for all the tables, so we warmed up the butter on a knife over the the open flame.Main course, I ordered the roasted lamb medium, the meat was lukewarm, it had that dry look on top, like it had sat for some time and it was chewy.  Normally I would send it back, but I guess this being the 3rd time there, it just wasn't worth the hassle.  Ditto on the temperature for the beef striploin.Dessert was ok, maple creme brule and apple pie with vanilla yogurt, cappucino and tea, nothing really crazy here, ok.The thing that did it was overhearing a waiter tell another table that the special was shortribs at the end of our meal, I love short ribs and would have ordered it, if I had known there was a special.I really have tried to like this place,  but there are just so many other restaurants I'd rather eat at, especially at this price.
