I'm sold!!! I just moved to Vegas and needed a fresh cut. I'm super picky about hair stylists but found great reviews on Megan at Josephine Skaught Hairdressing. My hair feels and looks so much healthier with the deep conditioning treatment. She added texture for much needed volume. She's very personable and "slaying" it with hair. I'm definitely coming back when I need a revamp
