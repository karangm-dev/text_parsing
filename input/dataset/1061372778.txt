I recently switched salons to come to Salon Yada. I have been so impressed with their services, their quality of customer care and the overall look of the salon. I have Dina do my hair extensions and she is absolutely fantastic! My hair looks natural and beautiful! Yemen does my color and is truly a master. Their front desk girl Trisha is also so welcoming. I couldn't be happier here and highly recommend it!
