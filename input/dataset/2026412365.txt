Schmitt jewelers does excellent custom work. They bought our diamonds and gold for a trade. We bought my engagement ring and my fiancées wedding band with Schmitt. Both were custom and we are very pleased so far with the process.One downside is they have very limited hours making it nearly impossible for my full time working fiancé to come with me.
