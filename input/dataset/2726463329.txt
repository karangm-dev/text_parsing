Well, well, well!  Well done!  This hidden gem is now my favorite bbq joint in the US (I've never been outside the north American continent)!  Best brisket I've ever had!  So, I was traveling from Indiana out to Scottsdale to visit my daughter and I didn't go once, I had to go back for seconds!  And, because of the 1st time, in which they were out of their baked mac and cheese ( which simply melts in your mouth), manager Mike came to our table and made us feel like we were special, not just another customer.  From the brisket, to the pulled pork, to their awesome mexicorn, this place does not disappoint!   Very evident also when you hear the other patrons oohing and ahhing over their meal.  DON'T LET THE GAS STATION/DETAIL SHOP FACADE FOOL YOU!  The reviews are real!  A must try for the bbq enthusiast.  Oh, and the baked beans are AUHMAZING too!
