So we took forever to find this hotel after having a flat tire changed in the middle of the night. We got there at like 3 A.M one reason it took so long was because I called the place and he wouldn't tell me how to get there from where I was. Just told us they were off of exit 45,which we already new in the first place. Then we got there eventually,  he said that they don't have a public restroom at that hour. What in the world?? Then we got to our room, and even though it was a non-smoking room, it still reeked of smoke and who knows what else. The floor was all lumpy, just covered up by cheap carpet. There were cobwebs on the ceiling, and funny smelling stains on the top of the mini-fridge. The beds were very uncomfortable, and the AC was so loud we couldn't have it above low because otherwise it would've kept us awake. In the morning, I took a shower and used the soap. It made me very itchy. They should have non allergenic!! Also, even though we got there at 3 AM , they made us check out at eleven or they would've charged us for another night. I recommend no one to go to this place. Definitely not worth the 75$. Stay at a different hotel. This has been my worst experience at any hotel. I hope this helps out whoever is reading this. I feel bad for whoever stays there next.
