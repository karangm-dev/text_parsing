I've purchased earplugs here before with no issue but lost them. When I returned to purchase two pairs I asked the salesperson, Jordan, if the size I was purchasing was the exact same as the demo, which he confirmed, incorrectly. When I returned two days later to exchange one unopened package he remembered me and our conversation. For good customer service, I assumed I would get a discount on the second pair for the error, but though he remembered the exchange he stated, "I remember what I remember and you remember what you remember."This was not a large purchase, but to have a customer leave without compensating a staff error says a great deal. I will never be back and will make sure to warn anyone considering a purchase here, large or small. You're better off buying online.
