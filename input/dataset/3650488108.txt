Came in with my best friend to have a slice. To my surprise they have personalized pizza and very traditional authentic Italian pizza. Our server was a guy named Richard. He was very efficient, quick & funny. His food knowledge is perfect. I'm reminded that life's always a little better with this as a great restaurant. This is a Phoenix must. And ask for Richard, to make your dinning experience wonderful.
