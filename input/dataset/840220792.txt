This place still has that neighborhood Butcher shop feel. The staff is excellent with the service being over the top good. I had some special requests and the level of attention yet again was superb. This is my first Yelp post and signed up just let people know. I have been going to this place for years and it seems to have gotten even better now with the newer owners.
