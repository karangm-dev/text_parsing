was thrilled a new place opened, but it fell short of my expectations...first off, the exterior of the building could use some work...I don't know if they rushed to open the place, but it helps if the establishment looks good also from the outside...next, the hostess placed us in a rotten/bad seating...hostess mistake, when you have so many available tables, you do not do this to a customer...I told her, we are moving to another table and she had a vinaigrette face...I didn't care...on the inside, the place looked ok, until I saw the cigarette smoke stains/or mold on the celing from the prior business...look at the ceiling by where the TV is at...the food, some things were good, spare ribs, crabs, desserts, but I will stop there...the fried rice was tasteless...why even have it out there unless its a filler...the beef and broccoli was ok, it would have been better if it was hot and not luke warm...the fried chicken, dry and day old...the egg roll, pretty bad...they must've made it themselves...why, not standard size...you taste a lot of the wrappings instead of whats on the inside...hot and sour soup, too liquidity, not hearty at all...the service was ok, but who just goes for the service if the food is not good...by the time we were leaving, people were packing in the place...don't know if they were just trying the place cause its new, or really liked it...I will say this, usually I will spend about an hour eating at a buffet, this place, I was done in 38 minutes...I will never go there again, not worth the time or money...next day I went to Hibachi Grill to redeem my taste buds...for those of you who will not heed my words of warning and venture to this place...I cum Deo...translation, Go With God...wear a cross and do a couple of hail marys also before you go!
