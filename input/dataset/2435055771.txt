I had booked marked this place a few months ago and remembered just in time as I was leaving the religious congregation that I was visiting just a couple of blocks away. We had very little time so decided to pick up some quick takeaway. Ordered a Kalga (according to the it is supposed to taste like chicken) Wrap, a vegan Cookies and Cream Milkshake and Masala (spiced) Wedges. It seemed to be a quick serve, but the order took anything but quick which was a big disappointment. Second there is another mandir ( a Hindu temple) next door which complicated the parking situation quite a lot. First the Cookies and Cream Milkshake was close to the real one, but could still taste the coconut milk aftertaste. A tad too sweet for us. Nevertheless 3.5/5. The Wrap made vegan, was a a complete disaster. We have faux meat (chicken, beef, fish) however the Kalga warp is nowhere close to the real thing. Not even close to faux chicken we have had. The texture and taste was completely different and tasteless. Not chewy, not seasoned and had a red outer lining that tasted and seemed weird. The pieces were tiny squares. The Wrap was a complete turnoff. (1/5)The spiced Wedges again was disappointing. The sauce was tangy perhaps the same they use for chaat (the tamrind chutney/sauce). The spices were non present and the Wedges would have tasted better plain!  (2/5)Wonder how their Pizzas are and other dishes are. I was hoping to make this spot my favourite Vegan stop, but was let down.
