Beyond poor....1 star is too many,from start to finish....left and then had to go have a great meal across the hall at Scarpetto....This is a real Tourist Trap with poor service We guess the great location keeps this place in business...If you are going to spend several hundred for dinner it should be special ...this place is surely about just taking your money...
