Really enjoyed my visit here. As an Earl Grey lover I was hesitant about trying it as an ice cream  but I was pleasantly surprised it very refreshing.  The bergamont flavor came through nicely. We ordered the turtle pastry and I had to try the earl tart which consisted of an earl grey infused mousse it was excellent. Creamy and decadent.  Ditto for the turtle tart which was our favorite.  Service was prompt and friendly. Location is quaint..not much seating is available though.
