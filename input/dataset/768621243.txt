I refuse to shop at Walmart ever again. Period. 200 check stands and my meat putrefies and ice cream melts while I stand in line? That's a load of garbage. I've mentioned the lack of enough cashiers to management numerous times and they're just as frustrated as I am. They aren't allowed to put more cashiers on. It's ridiculous! Also, the stores in Vegas do not have central a/c! Are you kidding me?? If I can't find what I need somewhere else, and only Walmart has it, then I don't need it.
