Thanks to the new management team taking over this restaurant this month. I am glad to see everything is much better than last time I came (two years ago). Manager Tammy and Jack are very friendly and I also can see the smiling face from the staff too which it makes a lot difference in overall atmosphere and service. The $338 menu with abalone, giant crab in creamy rum sauce, 5lbs lobster fried with spices and dried garlic, double fish, crispy fried chicken, assorted vegetables, fried rice and noodles! The menu is just over value! Thanks again for the enjoyable evening for me and my family.
