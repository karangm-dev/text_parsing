Had a customer come into to see me distraught because this computer repair place had tried to upsell her in a motherboard and extra stuff that she didn't need. The only thing wrong with her computer was the power supply, which they fixed but in the process of fixing it, they removed all of the screws and did not put them back in!!! I would NEVER  send a customer to this repair place again. They are a ripoff, try to upsell you to no end and then don't even give you your computer back with all of its parts!!!
