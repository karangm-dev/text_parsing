Wow people just because they beg for 5 stars in the front and don't really say if you are unhappy leave a rating. I was very disappointed & felt a waste of time and money. He doesn't do his high tech xrays, he doesn't explain anything at all like everyone says he does on their reviews. All I got for my money was you're doing a great job! You are an ideal Tmj patient. Just keep on managing it. I have an extremely high threshold for pain and when I'm in pain I'm not your typical patient begging for pain pills crying on the floor. I have done years of bio feedback on how to mask the pain maybe they should take that into account. If there was nothing wrong I should not have been referred out to waste money and most of all my time. I'm not looking for a surgery but I am looking for imaging to confirm nothing else is hidden that is going on in my jaw! Great you saw me on a day I could open my mouth & not the days I'm in bed crying in pain. All I can say is don't waste your time unless you are dying in pain crying! Then again if you have never had the best you wouldn't know what you are missing. My oral surgeon first was one of the top at UCLA. Then would I moved out of California to Colorado I had the top in Colorado jaw surgeons that actually do an extensive history and review and don't rush you because your appointment is first one and the doctor is already running a half hour late. Do yourself a favor find a doctor out of state and get on their wait list. It's well worth it! This doctor came with high reviews and from the posts maybe I was expecting more than a hand shake, smile and 2 minute consult.
