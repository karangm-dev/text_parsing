Great find. Great ambience but..really meager pour on martinis. I ordered their well vodka for  a martini and it was a 3oz pour, which is pretty small.It was $7. At nearby Venues in carefree, during Happy Hour, their 6 oz. martini to the brim with the Well vodka is $7. I am very eager to go back as their wine is good and reasonably priced but since I am a martini drinker, I may not go back. A shame.
