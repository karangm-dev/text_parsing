My wife and I ordered at the same time.  I ordered the chicken eggs benedict which was gross.  It came out right away though.  My wife ordered chicken and waffles and it literally came out 30 minutes after my food.  The service was bad, the food was worse.  The chicken was all breading and no meat.  Pass on this place don't even think about waiting in the long line for this subpar food.
