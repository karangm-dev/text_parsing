Health Warning.  Was in drive thru when Renzo dropped a to go container. He then picked up container from the floor and placed on food prep area partially in fried rice serving tray. I said something to Renzo who reluctantly threw away container and removed tray of fried rice. After receiving my food they added more food to already contaminated tray of fried rice. Disgusting. Health Warning
