Troy has assisted with several repairs to my rental home and has proven to be very knowledgable in his trade. I felt very comfortable with his recommendations and I was very pleased with his finished product. He provided excellent service and is reliable, honest and charges reasonable rates.  I wouldn't hesitate to hire him again and definitely recommend him to others.
