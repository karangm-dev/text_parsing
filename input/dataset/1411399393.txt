Call somebody else. The guy they sent had no clue. Spent total of 5 min on the roof. Comes down tells me the compressor is overheated. Will have to reschedule tomorrow same time when it is not overheated. Overheated? Just turned it on when you came. It is over 100 outside. Total BS. I called the company and was told he had not checked-in yet on this call. Really? Check the donut shop. Asked the dumbest questions like "why is it cool on this side of the house?" Two units on roof if you looked when you drove up. "How do I get on the roof?" Umm. A ladder? Call somebody else.
