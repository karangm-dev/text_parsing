Who owns this place?! Seriously I would like to know... I can not believe they have 4 stars honestly. Ice cream I will say is good but man somebody needs to get new employees... the girls who work there are miserable every time we come and each time we thought hmm maybe they are having a bad day... nope it is ridiculous! And 75 cents for extra Toppings that supposedly they had put in but were not there? And then you are bothering them to come order! One came up to window and my husband had to say hey how are you and we got a stern "what would you like?" Not good how are you?!?? Like a normal decent person! Sheesh!
