Took my husky here for the first time today. It was a great experience for both me and my dog. The staff was very friendly professional and my husky seemed to be very happy after I picked her up, she looked great by the way. One thing that I really liked was that when I went to pick her up, there was a customer there who, by the sounds of it, was called to come pick up her dog because they were having issues with and couldn't do the cut. To me that's a great sign that my dog is in good hands and I'll tell you why... I've read plenty of reviews of other groomers from customers saying that they got their dog back with cuts, overly shaved, etc. With the groomers excuse that the dog was aggressive and that's why that happened. I don't know about you but I would much rather get refused then to have them hurt my dog in the process. Anyway just thought I'd share that awesome moment and hopefully that helps anyone decide if this is the place for you and your pet.
