It's a hipster place with a cause. Went for lunch because of the 4.5 stars. Ordered the a ban mai. It was awful. Greece on top of Greece. Bread is the most important part and it was a swing and a miss! The salad was good and the reason it's a 2 instead of 1 star. Atmosphere is hipster. Food is ok  much better places in the area for lunch.
