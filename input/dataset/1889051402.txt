Warning: Their Old alignment machine may Not be able to do a 4-wheel alignment on a  sports car.Technically, I didn't actually get any service here. I'm just documenting my experience.Went in for a 4-wheel alignment, and 4.5 hrs after dropping it off, I get a call telling me that their old alignment machine can only do a 2-wheel alignment because my stock Nissan 350z is too low. I REALLY wish they had warned me about this possibility in advance.Pros: Seems like very nice people working there.Free fast Wifi in waiting room.They have a free shuttle service, but it involves using Your car.Neutral / FYI :They needed to keep my car for about 7 hours to do an alignment, which should only take about an hour. I was willing to wait a couple of hours, but that wasn't an option.No free estimates -- $30 to look at your car.Check for squeaking noise costs $99Cons: Mercie J Auto Care will Not use parts that I buy elsewhere (often at a much lower cost than what most shops charge).
