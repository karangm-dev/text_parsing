I love this place! It's a little out of the way so I don't get to come here as much I would like to. The only thing that sucks is they don't use al organic produce but they did mention they use from local farms. I love the concept of trying something and they give you a nice presentation that looks like a sake cup. I love the heathy quotes on the wall and the bright white atmosphere. They have no problem with you trying anything so don't feel bad. The Coco Crack is to die for and literally is like crack! You'll be craving it and have to come back! Every time I'm sick I come here to get my cure! One of the workers, Skye, is great and very helpful!
