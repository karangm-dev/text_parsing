I have been waxed monthly for the last 7 years. I have gone thru my fair share of salons. That all stopped when I met Yadira. She is by far the best cereologist I've ever had! I had an appt scheduled his week with her but was called by the Glendale location informing me she was no longer employed with the company. I'm seriously bummed about this and will unfortunately have to start looking for someone else. :(
