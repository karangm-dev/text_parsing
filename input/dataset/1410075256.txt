this place is Called "BULDOGIs" -I HIGHLY RECOMMAND THIS PLACE- VERY KOREAN & AMERICAN SOUL FUSIONS OF HOT DOGS & HAMBURGERS-it is a faraway spot because the second spot it was competeing in Chinatown--the Owner is Black/White & has married a BEAUTIFUL KOREAN WOMAN-which inspired his Korean Hotdogs & Hamburger fusions--He hand-makes & picks out his own ingredients & went to  Korea from any cities there--A VERY FRIENDLY PLACE--4 years running--workers are very pleasantly nice--i enjoyed everything about it--Bulgogi Hamburgers - Kimchi Hotdogs-to Salads & it is expanding & they said they might open one in Henderson !!As a Korean-American intuned IN Korean Culture- it makes me feel like home -they are also food truck owners too they also will expand & working their alcohol license too & they will also soon will have MAKE YOUR OWN HOTDOGS- doesnt have to be Korean- it can be a Philly Dog too--trust me it is pretty worth it-they got kicked out on SPRING MOUNTAIN !! LETS BRING THEM BACK TO A CLOSER LOCATION !!you wont regret it- PROMISE - coming from a VERY PICKY KOREAN-AMERICAN EATER-try the ANGRY DOGS, KIMCHI HAMBURGER- BULGOGI HAMBURGER-10 min - 20 min wait depending how many people are there if you're an asian fusion lover-GO GO GO-DID I MENTION"HANGOVER SOUP"
