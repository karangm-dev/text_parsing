I love this store and I love the owner, Greg. He is so helpful, polite, and fun while shopping. He really went above and beyond to find what I was looking for. He spent so much time trying to make me happy and I ended up with a great piece that I love! The store is always changing and I feel the prices are very reasonable. This is one of my favorite places to shop in the city. I highly recommend it to people who like to find something different each time! There is a great mix of industrial, antique, and some of everything else. There is a lot to look at!
