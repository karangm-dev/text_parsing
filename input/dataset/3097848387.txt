Booked an appointment online and received a confirmation email right away which was great but when I called to courteously let them know I was running late I was told my appointment was not with the person I booked, they left early so I was moved to someone else who also moved up my appointment to start 15min earlier. Seems there was a note to call me. Did they? Nope. Most awesome customer service ever. Will never use or recommend. Be careful ladies.
