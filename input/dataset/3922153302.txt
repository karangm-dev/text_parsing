I work at Wells Fargo right next door to rubio's on 24th st and baseline and out main goal is too satisfy the customers using our vision and values. That being said rubios is so relative because everyday I go to rubios for lunch they make me feel at home and like a valued customer by showing quality service and going over and beyond the standard for me! They don't sale chimichangas but the manager George and the great cooks took it upon themselves to fry my burrito for me! George is a great leader and represents that franchise at a high level! Last but not least Priscilla the shift leader, lights up the whole room with her smile as soon as you are opening the door, as well delivering excellent service! Thanks rubios - DA'QUON  #YOURBANKTELLER
