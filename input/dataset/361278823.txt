Went there with 3 others during "restaurant week".  Usual parking problems with the valet parking hogging the lot.   Place was clean, service was good.  The $40 special plus some lobster was mediocre at best.   I expected a great steak from a steak house.   The chocolate souffle was unrecognizable, but the creme brule was tasty.  The noise level was unbearable.   Despite my good hearing, I could hardly hear two of the other three people at our table.  I expected much more at an expensive restaurant and won't be returning.There are far too many better restaurants at lower prices than Morten's.
