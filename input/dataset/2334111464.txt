Happy Dog is one of the best "chill" places to eat a lot of great food that is quite cheap in Cleveland. I am vegetarian, and I must say, the veggie dog is excellent and does not taste like bland tofu AT ALL! I usually get a different fun mix of toppings every time, but I always top my hot dog with the macaroni and cheese and a fried egg. The fried egg is KEY. The tots are always a great addition to any meal and the best part is that you can order any number of sauces to go with the tots. Happy hour here is phenomenal! Overall, great place to get filling comfort food.
