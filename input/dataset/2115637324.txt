I loved the visuals of David LaChapelle and of course the music is quintessential Elton John. The show was big, glitzy, and fun. I walked out of the theater feeling inspired and amazed that we humans are so easily amused. The props seemed so simple. Big blowup inanimate objects, neon lights and balloons. It just never gets old- if it's done right.I laughed and I felt a little heartache too. If a show can make you happy, sad and inspire you... it's good!
