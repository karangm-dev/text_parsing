Went in there for a checkup on a rash that I had, a long with a skin tag removal and two moles that I wanted checked. Payed my $70 copay and waited for the PA-C. Jimmy Tran, PA-C came in the room, checked the rash briefly and prescribed something for it right away. So far so good. "What else?", he said. I had him check my two moles. He said we'll keep an eye out on them. Again, "What else?" I showed him the skin tag by my eye. He said that's a "baby" one and there was really no need to remove it now unless it got bigger or there was any pain. I thought, hmm since I'm coming back to have my rash checked I guess it can wait for next time. EXCEPT, that by waiting, I wasn't expecting to be charged another copay of $70. Wrong. By listening to him and waiting, now I'm stuck with the skin tag unless I want to be charged another copay. I really wish I would have stood my ground and insisted that it be removed right then and there, but I let my decision be swayed by his "expertise". Also, apparently he didn't examine the rash very well, because if he did, he would have seen that there was a cyst on it, which I'm sure the cream that was prescribed to me won't fix. If I didn't feel so rushed, I would have made sure to have him check it again. But sadly, I did feel rushed throughout my entire examination and he was literally in and out of the room in five minutes or less. Overall, if you do make an appointment here, I suggest taking your time and have him address your concerns thoroughly and make sure that you leave with all of your concerns taken care of at that moment. Don't have him rush you through your examination, because in the end, you're the one who'll be paying for it.
