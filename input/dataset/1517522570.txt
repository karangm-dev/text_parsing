We walked in there with a full soccer team (8 & 9 year old girls) and parents - 30 of us total.  As soon as they opened their doors! They weren't expecting it, and as you can imagine, it was a lot for anyone to handle, especially right at open.  We all had separate bills, too.  Any server's nightmare!  But the staff did such a great job, got all the food orders right and everything was perfect - especially the BLOODY MARY'S!!!!  (shhhhh ;)  Great job RR!
