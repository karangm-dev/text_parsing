So my friend and I got the Mani Pedi Groupon for her bday. We made the appt for 5:30 today. They called us and pushed us back saying 6:15 or 6:30. We picked 6:15 they gave us 6:30 my friend got there at 6:15 and the girl who ended up doing my nails was outside smoking. We went in and it was dead. My friend was picking out her color and she said she wanted a different color for nails and toes. The tech rudely said "why"? Like she was crazy for wanting different colors. My tech asked me so many times if I wanted Gel. I said no. I wasn't getting my nails done either so I was only using half the Groupon to begin w but we were treated like a hindrance. My water was cold. She didn't know how to work the sink. She did a great job on my toes after finally convincing me to get Gel. But was rude and a little unprofessional. They took our Groupon. We tipped and left. Now they're calling trying to get more money from the Groupon because the tech did Gel on my nails and the Groupon didn't cover it. Are you kidding me?! I told her 4x I didn't want Gel! She finally convinces me. Doesn't tell me it's extra. Finishes and we leave and now she wants more money. She knew the deal. I didn't even get the nails done so it should have been a wash. But they called my friend and the receptionist claims he thought it was all good too but the tech is wanting more money. Overpriced. Horrible Customer Service. Pretty area but that's it. Won't go back. Won't tell others to go.
