Excellent customer service!!!From time to time, I'll decide to sell old jewelry that's been laying around for ages. I popped in here and I was SURPRISED at what a great experience it was. He took his time with me, very professional, very patient and very private! Another lady came in and he had her sit on the comfy couch and wait ... About 10/12 feet away. I like that a lot. Thanks Aaron!!! * I've gone to places and felt like I might get approached by weirdos, robbed or killed in the parking lot on the way in or out! I did not feel that way here. That a major plus for me!!!
