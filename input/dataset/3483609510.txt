I was visiting my friend from out of town with another vegan friend, and she took us here for Sunday brunch. It is hands down my favorite place and I wish they had one in NY/CT! We got there early to make sure we could get a seat since the line apparently gets long. The brunch included an entree PLUS the brunch. That was definitely more food than needed, I would have been happy with just the brunch, but wanted to try the entree as well. So I tried to take tiny portions of the brunch food just to get a taste.The setting was super cute too! Very quirky and fun. The prices were a great deal too. I had to drive around a block for parking but found parking on the street. I hope to go back next time I'm in Pittsburgh!
