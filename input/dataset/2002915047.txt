As far a dunkin donut locations I have been to better. It's close to where I am staying for my birthday week and I have the app with a few free coffee rewards. That is the main reason I came to this location 2 days in a row. First day there was no line but I had to wait since I ordered a smoothie that apparently only one person knew how to make. And of course they were busy. Day two I decided to go simple and got a large coffee with two donuts. Coffee order was right but they gave me the wrong donuts
