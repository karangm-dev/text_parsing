I think they have the pricing for tbe buffets set about $7.00 too high. I dont like giving negative reviews but I can't see the value in paying for the quality of food and the matter that it is presented in. The carving station and sushi were good, the desert station was not appealing at all. Table service was friendly but not efficient.
