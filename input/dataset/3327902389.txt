Okay this review is based only on the ordering process as I didn't get to taste the pie. I ordered a pie about 10 days ago and was so excited as they had the type I wanted. The people were very nice who took my order and very accommodating! Hence the two stars. I ordered crumb topping and was so excited. We obviously didn't order anything else now for the birthday celebration with a bunch of people as they had what the birthday guy wanted! Then the day before the celebration when I was to go pick up the pie they call and say the kitchen made a mistake and made it with the wrong topping. Now what do I do last minute? They didn't offer any compensation and did they really expect me to take cream topping?
