Horrible experience with them. It was a dirty car when we first got it, A/C was really weak in scorching hot Vegas and the standard SUV we got could barely fit 3 medium sized luggage. Overall a terrible experience and also way too overpriced compared to their competitors. They need to seriously rethink how they run their operation if they're supposed to be considered an elite car rental company.
