So glad Glaze opened up right by my house. Their donuts are to die for! They taste fresh and authentic! They are also fluffy and totally delicious! My favorites are the classic glazed and the vanilla frosted with sprinkles. Their donut holes are a great treat and perfect size for my kids. Also a plus, the staff is super friendly and happy! Definitely try this place! You won't regret it!
