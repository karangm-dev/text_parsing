Snapdragon is probably the best salon I have ever been to in my life and I'm not exaggerating. I got my hair done by Jordana who was amazing and really saved my hair from a mess of highlights and damage. I was previously convinced that I needed to get highlights but Jordana was able to bring me to the dark side and I am so glad I did because it's so much better over here :). When the color and cut were complete I hardly recognized myself. It looked so much better and made me wonder what the heck I was thinking with those highlights .I can honestly say that I will never go blonde again thanks to Jordana's amazing talent and education on what hair color looks best with my skin tone and eye color. She really took her time to perfect my color and style which was so needed. I am seriously in love with this color and this salon. Not only was Jordana wonderful but all the staff at Snapdragon are so friendly and professional. They are attentive to your needs and create a fun and comfortable atmosphere. I will definitely be going back to Miss Jordana for my next visit since my husband also commented on how much he liked my hair as well. Thank you so much Jordana for fixing the highlighter hell that was on top of my head. You are very talented and I am so very happy with my new style. I will be sending more clients your way for sure. :)
