I was in the mood for some donut and came across this donut shop on our way back to our hotel room. It is located in a very big plaza with tons of parking. The owner is a war veteran and there are tons of photos on the left and right walls. We went at an awkward time (about an hour before closing) so they had only a few selections of donuts available. I initially went in to try one of their blueberry donuts and when I asked the owner if he had any, he said he can make it for us. At first, I hesitated because I didnt want to have him make an entire batch when I only wanted one. However, since I really wanted it to try it, I told him I can wait.After about ten minutes, he told me the blueberry donut was ready. Although initially I came in for only one donut, I decided to buy four since I felt bad that he made it for me. After I paid $3.60 (each donut was $0.90), he apologized for the wait and decided to throw in TEN donut holes! A few would've been nice, but seriously, TEN donut holes? So, for $3.60, I walked out with 4 donuts and ten donut holes. The blueberry donut is extremely moist and dense (like cake), its definitely a must try.Skip corporate/franchise donut shops and support local businesses! Definitely give Donut Hut a shot!CASH ONLY.
