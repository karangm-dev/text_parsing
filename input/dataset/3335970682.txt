This place was incredible! Such a hidden gem. Everything was delicious, the menu was huge, it was comfortable and totally unpretentious. At our table, we had an order of mild wings, a buffalo chicken grilled cheese,  soft pretzels with beer cheese, loaded beer cheese fries, and 2 orders of buffalo Mac & Cheese. No one had any complaints about anything and we will definitely be back :)
