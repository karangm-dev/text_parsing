Since becoming vegan, I haven't had a truly satisfying brunch!  I can find all sorts of places to eat vegan for lunch or dinner, but brunch, not so much.  There's a vegan menu, and it wasn't a hard choice for me.  I had French toast with strawberries, vegan breakfast sausages, and the server even brought me vegan butter!  My friend had the Lobster Benedict, and he really enjoyed it. Service was great! I'll be back in Vegas in October, and definitely coming here for brunch again!
