SideBar is the shizz.  I love the ambience, the bartenders are great, and the beer selection is not huge, but quality (although not on tap, so if you don't like bottles, don't come here).  I have nothing bad to say about this place.  It's the perfect small, mod bar.  I can show up in jeans and a tank top, or sequin covered minidress and feel equally comfortable.  I love their Gin Blossom, and Craig is pretty to look at and fun to talk to.  Never had a SideBar night end poorly.
