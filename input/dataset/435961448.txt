The heart wants what it wants. If you're going to eat a vegan meal that blows through hundreds of calories with every bite, this is a delicious place to do it. I had the poutine and southern plate, and everything was extremely filling, decadent, and satisfying. It's the opposite of health food. It's treat yoself food. That said, I know they have a few salads, but I feel like it's kinda like how McDonald's has salads... they're there, but nahhhh.Service was so friendly and genuine. The guys working here seemed like they truly cared about making my first Hogtown visit from across the continent a success. I would love to come back with an even bigger appetite.
