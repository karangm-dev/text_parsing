The beer selection here disappointed me, very laid back bar that can be a great hang out for friends on the weekend. The drinks are fairly priced but the whole theme of the restaurant/bar threw me off. It was disappointing that the whole patio was smoking friendly I do not smoke and could barely breathe out there so I was left with the only option to be inside....disappointing.
