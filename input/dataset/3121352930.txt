The place is nice on inside. Our waitress was very friendly but slow.  Food is over priced and not very good.  All 4 in our party wasn't pleased with the food.  And I ended up with an upset stomach all night.  The Parking lot is always full but isn't for the food - they are all at the bar.  Drinking here might not be bad but eat before you go!
