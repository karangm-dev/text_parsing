I don't often write reviews on any business but when service and quality is this amazing I have to help others by saying something. I just wanted to thank Paige and Paula for helping me find the dress of my dreams I feel like you are both family and I'm so thankful for all your honest input and listening so carefully to everything I needed and wanted. You both are different from all the other stores in that you didn't try to sell me what I couldn't afford and respected my opinions. I can't imagine any one going anywhere else for a bridal!!!!! You guys are awesome! Once again thank you for making me feel so special and helping me feel comfortable and have fun:)
