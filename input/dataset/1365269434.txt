We knew we wanted ramen while in Vegas (hot soup in the desert? Oh, yeah), but didn't know where to go.A fabulous-facial-haired Yelp buddy had written a stellar review of this place, and we knew this was the place to be. So, we made reservations (totally unnecessary) for lunch.The place was pretty empty at noon on a Sunday, but filled up pretty quickly. We were seated, offered drinks, and ordered from the prix fixe menu.+First course: Social House green salad with baby mesclun, tomato, and julienne slices of some root vegetable. It was dripping in the ginger dressing. It was tasty, but I wasn't interested in drinking my salad.+Second course: Tonkotsu ramen, pork broth, a slab of pork, served with a soft-boiled egg and some fried garlic bits. The broth tasted kinda funny, so we added a splash of soy sauce for some flavor, broke open the yolk to add some creaminess, and sprinkled in the fried bits of garlic for some bite. It helped tremendously. I finished the entire bowl. Woo, proud member of the Clean Plate Club!+Third course: spicy tuna cut roll. Here's where the problem lies: I don't know about you, but I cannot stand it when sushi has creamy ingredients added to it. Save the mayonnaise for sandwiches and the cream cheese for bagels. When I order sushi, I want simplicity; the flavors of the rice, nori, and fish must be able to stand alone, otherwise, I begin to wonder what you're trying to hide with that huge dollop of aioli. End rant. Anyway, with all that said, the sushi was NOT my favorite. Even the shrimp tempura cut roll had a ton of aioli added to the already-creamy avocado. What gives?The service was great and the atmosphere was beautiful, but what's all that when the food isn't excellent, too?
