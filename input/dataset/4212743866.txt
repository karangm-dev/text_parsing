I really wish I could give the LPC a better rating, but it would not be justified. This tiny and super cute restaurant is only about a mile away from me and because of such I have been here about 5 times. Although I could give the restaurant a 3 star, maybe even a 4 star rating on a good day, it is everything else that falls short. I have tried the sandwiches and vegetable variety plate and actually found them both to be flavorful and fresh tasting. However, the service is just...awful. And the most recent time, I would say the service fell short due to the owner and not the waitress. While the waitress seemed new, she was super friendly and attentive. Well, as attentive as she could be with the owner calling her to the back to....? Not sure....I am sure she was helping plate/cook/something, but that would leave the 6 tables or so of diners unattended. The time before we were waited on and served by the owner. He seemed nice enough but also had to keep tabs on the back of the restaurant and would be MIA for long periods of time. There is no way that anyone with an hour lunch break could eat here and realistically make it back to work on time. Finally, I have a hard time using the Groupon vouchers I have purchased here. The same day Groupon was not accepted because they already reached their limit for the day? Hmmm....Sadly, I will not be giving the LPC another try but I hope they listen to reviews on Yelp and get back on their game:)
