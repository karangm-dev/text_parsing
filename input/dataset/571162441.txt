Went in for a pedi....Wasnt greeted or asked to choose a color. I just signed in and sat down. About 15 mins later I was escorted to a pedi-chair. No talking. "Tech" pulled out menu and I chose the a la carte pedi with $10 for extra massage. The cuticle trim, nail trim, and file process took a hurried 10 mins. Massage was PAINFUL. I winced and she asked if it was too much and I nodded. She then smoothed my legs and feet for 15 mins. Left me to dry and started on another person's manicure. I got up after 10 mins and paid. Whole thing from beginning to end was akward and unimpressive.
