I was extremely disappointed by this location. I had appointments scheduled at 130, 2 and 215 for myself and children. I arrived at 115 to complete paperwork.  No one was taken back until 230 and at that time I was told that we would have an additional hour or more wait since we were new patients.   I'm incredibly disappointed with this facility and their lack of promptness.
