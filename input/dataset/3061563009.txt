Sorry but not impressed. Like the store frontage, but that is where it pretty much stops.  Only place offered to have a cup of coffee is the social table which frankly is not comfortable when sitting on hard stools.  Pour over coffee did not taste good, but was offered a drip house coffee instead. It was better but not great. A bit pricey on the coffee.  Rating this on coffee and experience only.
