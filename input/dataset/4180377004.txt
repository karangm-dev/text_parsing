I just want to start out by saying Rasheen is the best! She is also very professional and listens. She is extremely patient and will go above and beyond to make it right. I went to her years ago and lost her contact info. Imagine my elated surprise when I was doing a search and found her Extension studio was now closer to my house and it was her! I called her and scheduled an appointment and am so happy I found her. As I was telling her, I could write a book on all of my hair experiences. I am very picky and I have tried wefts, tapes, individual fusion, and never been happy, The other sew in method that people do can sometimes be bulky and easily detected. You are constantly afraid if the wind blows a certain way people will see it! Not with Rasheen. She has perfected her method and is a true artist. She also had her colorist custom color my hair to match my blonde and the different tones in my hair. I am so happy I found Rasheen again and I would highly recommend her to anyone wanting a natural look! Thank you!
