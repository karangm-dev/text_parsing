Recommended!It was such a pleasure talking to Mike and to hear such a friendly person! We've been waiting for two other electricians for a week to get back with us, and within an hour Mike was able to contact us and resolve the issue over the phone! He went the extra mile and made several phone calls that he didn't have to! It's so refreshing to find a company who cares about their customers! We will recommend them to any one, and in just one call he gained loyal customers!God bless you!
