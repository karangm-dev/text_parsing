Disappointing, expected more coming from Guy.   Checked in and was told 15-30 min wait. We waited over 30 minutes while other people were seated before us upon walking in after us. We were told they were VIP. Then, ordered and waited forever. Breakfast was subpar. Eggs Bland and over cooked, potatoes not fresh, syrup watery. Overall, a total waste of time.
