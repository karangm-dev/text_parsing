These guys moved into the old Camping World location. Glad they did. They are just around the corner from my office, and the two times I have popped in there for something ,they not only had what I needed, but had at a fair price. I needed an oddball thing, lock parts, and they had a used one that they sold me super cheap. Solved my problem and got me on my way.The counter guys are the helpful type with a can do attitude. They also seem to be empowered to make the customer happy, like discount tire does. I do most of my own RV repairs, but when I need a pro, I'll bring it here.
