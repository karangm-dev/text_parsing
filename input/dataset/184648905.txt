This bank is THE worst. There is no care for customer service at this place. Everytime that I've come here, no matter what time of the day, I stand in line for no less than 20 mins and up to 1 hour. They only have one teller and the rest of the staff stands behind the glass and just avoids eye contact. Horrible. If I didn't have to come here to deposit money into a family member's account, I would NEVER EVER come here. Wells Fargo Bank is way more accommodating.
