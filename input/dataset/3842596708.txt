Excellent chicken sat√© sub sandwich (#5 - $7.25) and delicious charbroiled chicken vermicelli. (#16 - $9.50). Sub sandwiches are reasonably priced and meal is prepared quickly. Don't look for atmosphere, this is a get-in-get-out kind of a place or good for take-out. Owner is very kind and considerate. My one complaint is the pricing of the bubble tea.
