I've been shopping here while attending ASU and never had a great experience, but today I was met with three of the most rude employees. One of them made an extremely rude comment to me when I kindly asked for help unlocking a product. This employee was just standing behind the registers laughing with another employee doing nothing. So a different employee had to help. After waiting in line again the cashier that helped me didn't even say one word to me because she was laughing and loudly swearing with her colleagues.
