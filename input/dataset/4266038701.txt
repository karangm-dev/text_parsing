There are articles and people's opinions thinking Randy's Patties are #1 in Toronto, but Patty Time is THE best patty I've ever had.Recommended to my by a Chinese Jamaican friend who has had all kinds of Patties in Jamaica and here in Toronto. Apparently, Patty Time's owner is Randy's owner's father. I've had Patty Time's patty before I had Randy's and I must say, PT is hands down THE best patties I've had. Spicy and mild.The location is at Lawrence and Brimley. They dedicate the store to patties. The back of the store has Patty masters working away for hours generating warm, fresh and delicious patties in huge ovens (you can peak when ordering fresh patties). They offer frozen and warm patties.They sell individually and in dozens.
