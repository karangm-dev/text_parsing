Believe. The. Hype. I'll spare you my BBQ credentials because you don't care anyway! But this is the first place I've been to that has impressed me enough that I'm writing my review table side. I've been trying to eat here for a few weeks now, but the lines are so long, even finding a parking spot at this industrial location has been impossible. They say lines are a good sign. This could t be any more applicable. The food speaks for itself. It's good, quality meat, grilled/smoked to absolute, melt in your mouth, perfection. As I patiently waited in line, already drooling over the perfectly fatty brisket before me, the man carving the meat who I could only presume is the owner, sliced me a piece to sample. It was sublime. I decided on the El Jefe which included the aforementioned brisket as well as sausage, pickles, onions, and coleslaw. It comes with one side, but seeing that I couldn't decide between beans or jalape√±o grits, I sprung for both (an incredibly wise decision). Halfway through my meal, the owner checked up on me and asked what I thought. I was speechless. Not only because the food was nothing short of phenomenal, but also because I had a huge bite of my sandwich in my mouth. I stupidly responded with a nod and thumbs up. Do yourself a favor, come here and treat yourself to some good bbq. But don't tell your friends because if I have to wait another few weeks to take my wife to my new favorite bbq joint, I'll be pretty upset.
