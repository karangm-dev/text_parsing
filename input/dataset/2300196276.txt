Great Breakfast at very reasonable prices!  The omelettes are awesome! So many choices, my son loves the pancakes, the selection is very intriguing? The fresh fruit kabobs that come with your meal are delicious. The lunch is just as delicious as the breakfast.  Best burger I've had in Scottsdale!- the Reuben is off the hook!!  It's a busy place, but if you go at off peak times you won't have to wait!
