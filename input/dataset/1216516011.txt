I'm originally from St. Louis and love Steak 'n Shake.  Unfortunately, my experience at this location was extremely disappointing.  It took probably 15 minuets to get seated even though half the restaurant was empty.  Ordered a cheeseburger & fries & a shake.  My girlfriend ordered the Frisch melt & fries.  When the order came we were very disappointed to find out that they were not the shoestring fries that you normally get at a Steak 'n Shake.  We also asked that the fries be cooked crispy/well done.  They were not crispy!  The Frisco melt is supposed to come with a toasted sourdough bun.  That bread was barely toasted.  We were told the manager was going to come and talk to us, but they never did.I wanted to show my girlfriend that Steak 'n Shake is better than In & Out but this Steak 'n Shake was the worst fast food establishment I have ever been to.This place was highly unorganized and needs a reboot!!!
