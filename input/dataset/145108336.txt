Excellent quality fresh and flavorful food for very fair prices. Excellent service. Nice atmosphere. Take out option.I actually contacted the owners and suggest that they set up another restaurant in another town in a different part of the county, and they listened! Now open, North and South Seafood & Smokehouse, DeForest, Wisconsin! I can hardly wait to come in again. My personal favorites are the variety shrimp kabobs and plank salmon, out of this world! You have GOT to try this place and experience it for yourself! Yum-o!
