I'm a self-proclaimed pizza snob and Jesse's Supreme Pizza was excellent. Nice mix of pepperoni, spicy sausage and yummy vegetables. I only wish I'd ordered the large. The best thing by far though was the garlic knots. You get a dozen for less than $5. They are so delicious I ate at least three right away. Will be a regular customer for sure. Food was delivered quickly which was a nice bonus.
