I was very excited about finally trying Eggslut. We waited in the 30+ minute line for this experience. However, as soon as I was next in line to order, 3 guys walked up and cut the line. Patrick, the manager, allowed this and said it was fine because they "called ahead," yet still placed their order on the spot. It was incredibly disrespectful to all of us who had been waiting in line that these guys somehow got preferential treatment. I will not be coming back.And my sandwich was only okay.
