This is by far the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant in this area. The staff was completely unhelpful and clueless. I ordered take out and they forget half the order, so I had to make a second trip to pick up the forgotten chips and guacamole. After my second trip I simply gave up as they still forgot to include the chips. The drink machine was also broken so the beverage I purchased was completely useless. The staff had no interest in repairing the broken machine. Also, while talking on the phone trying to resolve my broken order, the staff was absolutely clueless and seemingly didn't remember the order I had picked up only moments earlier. All of this could be forgiven if the food didn't taste like trash. If you're looking for Mexican in Phoenix, do yourself a favor and go to chipotle....
