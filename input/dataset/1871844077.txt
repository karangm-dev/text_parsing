I'm talking about steak.  Not hyped up, sauce-laden, fancified steak.  Just pure steak.  And it's the best I've had in the western United States.  I've eaten her at least 50 times in the past 4 years, and the consistency of the food - Barry Dakake is always on fire - is amazing.I generally go for the bone-in rib-eye or the filet.  I've tried all of the sides - but they are so decadent that I usually just eat the steak!Often I'm by myself for business, and I'll stop by for a "lite" meal - garbage salad, popcorn shrimp and a couple of martini's at the bar - Johnny and Shar have been their for a long time and really care about people.The atmosphere is way too hip for me - but I find that if I go early in the evening (say, between 5:30 and 7) - it's quieter, and the staff has much more time to spend on making sure my experience is a pleasurable one.I'll say it again: The. Best. Steak. In. The. Western. United States.
