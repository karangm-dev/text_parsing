Tiny portions! And not enough menu options for vegetarians/pescatarians. If you're vegan the only item on the food menu for you is guacamole lol. We came on a Friday night around 8pm without a reservation and got extremely lucky to be seated right away. Super packed in here, and pretty loud, so definitely make a reservation for the busier nights if you plan on coming and probably not the best place to come to try to catch up with someone because you really have to yell across the table to be heard. The price range here is higher than many other Mexican places, like Wilbur Mexicana that's a block or two east. The guacamole was fresh, but tiny for $8. The only vegetarian tacos on the menu last night were poblano ones with cheese and cream $5/taco. Again, super basic and I found it odd how they served my partner these one at a time (he ordered 3) lol. I love shrimp tacos, but these were not on the menu and the only seafood one they had was a beer battered branzino. So instead I ordered the ceviche $15, which was pretty spicy and salty! Although small, it did come with a cup of pita chips and I found it sufficient more or less for the night.Service was spotty - nice server, but he was covering way too many tables, so we rarely saw him. Had to ask for napkins and never did get that water refill. Next time partner and I will source our tacos from elsewhere, like El Local Loco (the shrimp tacos there are great!).
