Was not impressed. Overly priced items. They do not allow substitutions. Ordered breakfast and would not give me Sausage and bacon. Even though they charge $1 per bacon strip, i couldnt get it. This is just poor service. Regardless if the owner doesnt allow. This is rediculous. Their shared service is confusing. Did not know how to ask for refills or when they did not deliver all our food. I ordered scrambled eggs, and they were not real eggs. Orange juice was mediocre. Had better experiences with breakfast else where. I came here because i saw it on the food channel. Will not be returning due to the experience.
