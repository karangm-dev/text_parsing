What a great service experience!! Our server, Melissa was really friendly and entertaining. We were visiting from Florida and she made us feel very welcome. The food was great too, but it took second stage to the phenomenal table side manners of the whole crew. It was a great experience. If you are siting in a hotel looking at ratings of local eateries, look no further. GO HERE!!
