Bread was stale, fries were not hot, nor were they any better than everyday fries at a burger joint. Certainly nothing like the glorious experience they describe on their website. Lots of burnt bits too.We had mussels which were fine. Beer was good, though expensive. We won't be hurrying back. All hat and very few cattle.
