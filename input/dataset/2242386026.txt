First off, they have these fantastic movie theater seats that are cushy, red recliners that are fully automatic.  I am so stoked that they opened Centerpoint back up and gave it this amazing upgrade. When you buy the tickets, you pick your seats from a seating chart.  This threw me off at first.  But, once I saw the inside of the theater, it was justified and I was blown away.They are like love seats if you push up the armrest between you and your companion. If you don't know the person next to you, that might be a bit weird. Overall, there is definitely limited seating since the theater is average and the seats are gargantuan. You would never have the "stuffy & overcrowded" movie experience.  You better book those seats early!I did not partake in concessions but the soda machine looked very self serve and state of the art. I will be coming back here for sure.Hey Center Point! Think you might get a child care service/option at this location? If so, you could have a ton more business.  I know I sure would!
