AWESOME pizza place. Let's start with when you walk in, all the staff members welcome you, total plus if you are like me and those things matter. You get to see all the ingredients, kinda like subway or chipotle only its for pizza or salad. You can add anything you want for the same price. Also, if you come with a family or have a larger stomach to fill, try the mega size. It's two of the mod size pizzas on top of each other. The bottom pizza is cheese and the top is anything you want. If you are a pesto fan, add it to your piZza !!!! In addition, they have a sauce called the sriRancha it's sriracha sauce and ranch mixed. I was a little weary of it but OMG! So good. It's a perfect mix of spicy and ranchy lol! Next, I tried the cookies and cream milkshake. Normally I wouldn't order a milkshake but he got me when he said it was made with oreos. Holy smokes, so good. Especially for someone who doesn't like milkshakes! Last thing, do I recommend? YES! YES! YES! YES! This is my third time in a week, let's just say when I like a place, I will be back several times.
