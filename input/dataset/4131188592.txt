Despite the great car washes Alamo is known for, I was very disappointed with my detail job. I have a compact car, an SLK, and they still charged me a whopping $260.00 to detail it. Worse, when we picked up the car, it was quite evidently a rush job, with lower panels not detailed correctly and the insides also showing signs of careless cleaning. Very disappointing. I suggest you save your money if you want your car detailed, by taking it somewhere else. This detailing was worth $150, no more.
