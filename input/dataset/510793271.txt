First, there is no solution to their shitty parking situation. You will have to walk at least a couple blocks and leave your vehicle in an unattended - or poorly secured - lot. Second, couple that with the busy traffic surrounding the fair grounds, and you'll have a real fun time trying to cross any streets safely. Third, the quality of life that these types of events attract are... at least ten time worse than what you can spot at your local Walmart in the middle of the night. The event security is also apparently largely ineffective. Don't think I'll ever be trying this again.
