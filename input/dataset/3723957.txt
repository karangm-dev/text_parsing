I have stopped at Salud Juicery twice now. Both smoothies I got were good but nothing overly exciting. I've gotten the Green Anna Bread smoothie & the Racers Edge smoothie. I loved the Green Anna Bread, would definitely get again & the Racers Edge was ok but would not really bother getting a second time. My husband ordered the Jungle VIP which was really good & the Toned Yogi which neither of us liked.It's great that they have a lot of different options from smoothies to juices to coffee. You're guaranteed to find something here you like. It's also nice that they give you the choice of 2 different size drinks. I think the larger size is reasonably priced for the size of the drink. They also do offer a stamp card, which is always nice. I love that more juice bars are opening up around town. I want them all to thrive, we need more healthy choices in the city..you really can't have too many options. Will definitely be going back to try some more drinks. And would definitely recommend checking them out.
