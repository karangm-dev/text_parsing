Ate here and we won't be back. First off what a dumb way they have the line arranged, the line should come in from the left and "move" along the counter. If this place was busy (which it was dead when we went) it would be a nightmare to navigate that line and checkout mess.  They should get money back from who ever designed that store. The burritos were tiny, gave us a small scoop of beans small scoop of rice that she scraped from the bottom of the container, topped it with some meat and pico/lettuce but it just was nothing to come back for. My 9 year old told me he was going to need two burritos because they were tiny. Would rather go to cafe rio or chipotle or the other numerous Mexican joints around town where you actually get a decent portion for your money.  I will be Shocked if this place lasts another year!
