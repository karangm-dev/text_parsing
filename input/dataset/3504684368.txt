Went there today and got the same order as last time and the peri peri rice and roasted veggies were old and rotten. The rice smelled like it had been going bad for a few days the vegetables were shrived and the smelled repugnant. I ate the chicken on its own and then called them to tell them what was wrong with my dinner. Turns out the worst thing isn't their food, it is how they treat their customers. The lady I spoke with was so rude, did not even apologize, rushed me off the phone and told me to call back when the manager was there. What kind of a business that wants to retain people serves them rotten food then don't have the decency to apologize? I do NOT recommend this place because I couldn't guarantee you would get food that isn't rotten.
