WOW!!!  I was starting a grooming class last minute and needed  clippers and some blades. I asked Ryan's  how much  Next Day shipping would cost $98.00. I said never mind, just send it regular UPS. Two days later I got a package from Fed Ex. It's been a long time sense a company made me feel like my business mattered. THANK YOU RYAN'S..... YOU GOT MY BUSINESS FOR NOW ON.....
