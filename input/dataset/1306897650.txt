We turn in my wife's car for a fender and bumper repair. I had checked with 2 other body shops. Price was just a little higher. But I picked this from reviews. Sometimes the price is not the determining factor for me. Turn it in on Monday with a week as eta for the car being done. On Wednesday mid-morning received a call Car will be ready at 4 pm. One thing was overlooked. But it was not the reason the car turned in for. A little chip on the door handle was missed. But it was an afterthought. Can you do this? So no big deal. Still a 5 star review.
