I scheduled an appointment with SMIL online after my Doctors office called saying the MOM mammogram was inconclusive and that they forwarded the images to SMIL. I showed up at SMIL, wasn't too long of a wait at first. Once I was in the back and sitting in a robe that I sat and waited a while, I was called back thinking I was going to get a scan but I was told they didn't have my file and I would have to come back. She (blonde manager) promised a callback the following week and that she would personally call me. No one called me so I called and was left on hold then was told they would call me back, no one called. I call again, I'm put on hold indefinitely so I hang up. Following week I call, same thing I'm left in hold I'm told they won't leave me on hold but then she tells me she's sorry but she will have to call me back. To this day no call back has been made and I will avoid this business at all costs now.
