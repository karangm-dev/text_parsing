Wow! What a find In the middle of a desert!!!Authentic, Japanese Shabu Shabu!!!Perfectly presented, seasoned & served. Cooked right on our table the way it should be. We enjoyed the Kurobuta pork,shrimp & vegetarian dinners and were blown away by the delicious flavors!Grew up enjoying this special treat and also enjoyed this dish in Tokyo.This restaurant has all the elements perfect, and we were so amazed that we were in the suburbs of LV.I'm from LA, and I've eaten Shabu Shabu many times in other restaurants but none can match the quality of the meats, seafood & vegetables. The dipping sauces were perfectly seasoned and everything was SO fresh and flavorful.In addition to the excellent food, the service was exceptional and exceeded are expectations. Very nice! For a taste of Tokyo in Henderson, go to Shabu Shabu Paradise...We ate to our hearts content, and now counting the days till we return!!!
