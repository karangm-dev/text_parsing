This is a home reno supply store, similar to a Home Depot in the middle of Little Portugal. But unlike Home Depot's gaudy orange and grey monstrosities of warehouses, this supply store is jam packed with aisles brimming with essentials. Walking around, it's like you're in a maze with more cool stuff waiting around the next corner. They have sections devoted to different aspects of building things with staff on hand to answer questions. The check out counter is well staffed and right by the entrance making it easy to park right in front on Ossington, jump in the store and quickly dash away. What is super impressive is their bathroom piece selection. Upstairs they have a showroom with modern freestanding bathtubs and fancy showerheads and kitchen sinks lined up showcasing beautiful design. If anyone knows ceramic tile, the Portuguese know it better than anyone. The selection is fantastic! The mecca in the GTA is Olympic tile, but after going thru Olympic, Downtown Lumber won out with its tight selection of choice tile designs and helpful staff. There is even free customer parking right behind the store where a tight laneway leads you to almost valet style parking, very nice! When your order for lumber, cement, or tile is filled at the service counter in the store, you take the invoice down the back laneway where the warehouse is tucked away. After a couple visits I was most impressed how the guy back there immediately came out to fill my order after driving into the tight spot. And he even loaded up the heavy tile into the car (they also deliver!). Super service from some incredible and dedicated people. Thumbs up Downtown Lumber!
