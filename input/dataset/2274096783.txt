I have had the worst experience with Westin Harbour Castle's gym team, in particular with their Workout Attendant. I subscribed to a single month gym membership (Westin also had semi-annual membership and annual membership, but I didn't subscribe to them) in November, but later found I was charged for December, January and February too. When I asked to see the contract with my authorization, The attendant told me that she has destroyed all my files (!!!) and couldn't do anything.Then she double charged me for February and said she'd refund me. When I saw my credit card account I was appalled - instead of refunding me she charged me again! I was charged THREE TIMES! And my credit card company said they can't do anything because I gave my credit card information to Westin and that I should be communicating with Westin.Well, I emailed them two weeks ago but didn't hear anything.This is just the greatest customer service I've had. As per Yelp's guideline, I'm not posting this review to "use removing or posting your review as a way to extract payment from a business". I'm simply sharing my experience here with other people. I would never give my credit card information under any circumstance to Westin again.
