The security door at my front entrance had been sticking and finally I couldn't get it open at all.  Jack came out the same morning I called and took care of the problem.  He showed me that keys I'd had made at the hardware store were just a bit off that made them hard to work to operate the locks.  Jack made me several extra new keys... All my doors open with the same key so Jack checked each new key in each door to be sure they were all working properly.  Thorough, competent, friendly and the price was reasonable...
