I'm pretty sure all these comments are made up because TPM is the worse Property Management Co. The real reviews are on the other Triumph Property Management links. I will try to make this short by saying they never return phone calls, the can't keep the books accurate so they ask you to repay fees that were paid (keep receipts and all documents), takes months to get a maintenance request done, very rude and    unprofessional. if you want the full details click this link: http://www.yelp.com/biz/triumph-property-management-las-vegas-3
