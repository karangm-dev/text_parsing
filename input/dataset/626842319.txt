This is definitely my new crawfish joint! I'm from Louisiana so my family is really on eating crawfish. It is rare to find a place that is fresh and Smokin' Crawfish has some of the most freshest sea food I've tasted in Vegas. OH MY GOD THERE FOOD IS SOO GOOD! Their oysters & crawfish were sooo fresh and did not taste fishy like most places do! You definitely get that home-made taste. The place is really neat as well, a modern kick to it ;p The staffs were very, very friendly. They always came over to check on us and made sure our waters were always filled. Amazing custom service. Try this new tasty place! You won't regret it!
