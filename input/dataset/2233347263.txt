This place lives up to the hype 100%I arrived 15 mins before it opened and there was still a line. But the owner came out to greet people and gave out sausage samples.Things I had a chance to tryTurkey: not one part of that turkey was dry. I'm not a big fan of turkey but I would definitely order this again Brisket: the fatty brisket was my favorite. Tender and moist, it just melts in your mouth.Pork Rib: they literally fell off the bone it was so tender.As for sides I enjoyed the cheesy grits more than the beans. Both were good.The pecan pie is worth grabbing. Good balance of sweetness and the crust is flakey, intact, and scrumptious. Normally I don't care for service, but this place was amazing.Would come back for sure.
