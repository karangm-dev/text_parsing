This was amazingly fun!! I went with a group of 8 friends and we conquered the Pearled Pachyderm with 11 minutes to spare! I'm happy to say that it was challenging mentally even with 8 adults working on the clues together. If you like problem solving then this is definitely a must try. Can't wait to go back and do the second room!
