Just had my car detailed (got a Groupon) and they did a really nice job. I have to be honest, I was expecting poor quality due to the other reviews on here. However, two people showed up early to my home and took about an hr and a half for my CRV. The car is very clean and looks great! The people were very nice and even helped me as they were leaving to put the antenna on my car (I'm pregnant and they didn't want me to have to climb up, even though it was off when they got here). Bonus - once they come out once they told me they will always honor the groupon price for future detailing! This seems like a smaller company than many, so expect to wait a few weeks to get on the schedule, but I was very impressed with the quality of work and the price and will definitely be using them again!
