I'm in Montreal for a couple days for meetings along with the rest of our division.  Eight of us had supper at Restaurant L'Orignal in Old Montreal.It was cute inside.I ordered the pork special.  I specifically said I just wanted potatoes and pork.  When it came, there were also asparagus and mushrooms.  When I mentioned it to our server, she said I must have miscommunicated with her.  Yet when I looked at the bill afterwards, it did say that I just wanted mashed potatoes.  So there!  The pork was apparently wrapped in plastic and poached in spices and then grilled to order.  It was okay, not great.  The mashed potatoes were cold and too pureed/mushy.  I was shocked when the bill came to see that it was $29!Desserts were a bit hit around the table!  I had blueberry crumble ... it was delicious!  It was the best part of the meal!I'm not a fancy schmancy diner so it's a treat when I'm in a nice restaurant.  Though our server was friendly and took good care of us (other than saying I had miscommunicated with her), I wasn't impressed with the food, especially considering the prices.
