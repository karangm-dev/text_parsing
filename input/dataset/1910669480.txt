The best part about this restaurant is the location and looks.  There was definitely time and money spent on making this feel like a cool place.  So, if you are just looking to go to a cool place in the area, you won't be disappointed.  If you are interested in spending your money on food and service also, read on...The service here seems to fit a disappointing trend of "cool" restaurants.  Staff is very interactive with each other, and not so much with the customers.  Food knowledge is lacking and it feels like bartenders and waiters feel like they are entitled to your 20% tip and trying to figure out if your going to give it to them right away.  The food is overpriced and nothing special.  Amount of protein in about every dish is small, clearly to increase profit margin.  Expensive chips and salsas that you pay more for because you get 3 average salsas instead of 1.  I've actually been here for happy hour several times, and the most memorable part is the bill at the end... thinking it really wasn't worth that much.If you're looking for great Mexican food, there are many better options.  If a cool restaurant makes the food and service seem incredible, then you will like this place.
