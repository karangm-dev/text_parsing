A Pittsburgh Institution although I feel like so many yinzers have never heard of Nancy's.A small unassuming building not far from the Waterfront serves giant buttery chocolate chip cookies (and other baked goods) worthy of every calorie they add to my diet. For added decadence might I suggest the cookie enrobed in even more chocolate?
