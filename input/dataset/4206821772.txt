I was looking for an ice cream place late last night and found this place next to Jobots.  The flavor choices are unique and everything I sampled was very good. I got a scoop of the Greek yogurt and the carrot cake I wish I got a scoop of the cucumber sorbet, but I knew I couldn't finish 3 scoops.  I love how the ice cream is served in a takeout container with a fortune cookie.  Definitely a special little place!
