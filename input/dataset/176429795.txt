I love this place. Everything is so savory, flavorful and wonderful!!I got an amazing iced mocha here!I also got an unbelievably deelish sandwich.They have beautiful looking desserts and gelato too.There is one more pekarna location but this one is in with an AMC Theater if you are looking for a movie to go with your sandwich or dessert...
