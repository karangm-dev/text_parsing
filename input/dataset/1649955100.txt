Took a tour of the Grand Canyon and Sedona this past weekend. I was a little skeptical booking the trip since this was my first time in Arizona. And i must say I had an amazing time! Kim was very professional and pleasant to travel with. She provided facts about AZ and kept the tour very interesting even though the ride was very long. I would recommend this tour to everyone. Thank you for making my experience so wonderful.
