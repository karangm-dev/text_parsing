Nate's is a wonderful local lunch place. The place is always busy for dine-in and very popular with take away as well. They do participate in delivermefood.com's service (a third party restaurant delivery service), but there are order minimums that depending where you want it delivered may be hard to meet when just getting lunch for one. I couldn't meet the $30 minimum for my neighborhood so I called in an order. I was impressed that I was given just a 10-15 minute wait time when I called at noon. I ordered the Shawarma Plate on Hummus. It was served (see photo) in a rectangle to go container. It was completely filled with hummus and then layered with thin and small chopped pieces of well done beef. It was wonderfully flavoured with onion and parsley. I was given three full sized soft circle pitas with it - way more than I needed, but one is great to have so you can mop up all the left over hummous with it. Even with taking hummous with each forkful of meat there was so much left at the end to dip the pita in. Wonderful filling lunch! If you've not tried Nate's definitely make a visit soon. They only take cash, but there are two banks on the same block as them. Friendly and fast service and my order was ready in the time frame given and despite being super busy was handed to me with a smile.
