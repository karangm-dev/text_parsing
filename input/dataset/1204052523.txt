I came to this place for several times before and was always happy with my manicure and the result. However today's manicure was a nightmare. Girl, who did manicure, cut 4 fingers of mine !, -- I didn't get any discount or even 'sorry'. Shape of the nails is not equal. Also, she put only one layer of her nail polish on my nails. Highly disappointed today. For 35$ I got my nails infected with cuts.
