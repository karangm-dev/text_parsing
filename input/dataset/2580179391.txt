Super disappointed. I had high hopes for this place. We waited 15 mins for a table and it was so not worth it. The pancakes were super thick and not good at all. My huevos rancheros were not very good either very bland.  Service was not good, our server came by once he didnt even deliver our food. It just wasnt good, the only decent thing here was the waffle. I wouldn't come back or recommend. I was not happy at all. Overpriced!
