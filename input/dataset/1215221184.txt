As a long-time fan of Chick-fil-A, I wasn't walking in expecting to be comparing the two. But as we ordered, sat down, and were served, I couldn't help it. The service is as good, if not better here than at CFA. The sauces are better, and so is the chicken! Everything was very clean and we were thoroughly impressed. I would like more sandwich options--I think next time I'll just be getting chicken strips because I ended up eating just the chicken off my pimento crunch sandwich. Very impressed!!!
