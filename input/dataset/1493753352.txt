I rented a Porsche Boxster as a surprise for my boyfriend during our trip over Labor Day weekend.  He was like a little kid at Christmas!  We had a blast!  The car was clean, fun and it was really hard to hand the keys back to Rick!  Speaking of Rick, he is one friendly, honest, down-to-earth guy who you can tell is living his dream.  He picked us up at the airport and dropped us off without a hitch.  We highly recommend Rick and his business!!  Believe the reviews!  You won't be disappointed! :)
