Blah... That is the first word that came to mind when I sat down at this place.  The record covers for the menu is completely lame and I don't quite understand the concept of letting customers write on the chairs. This is a poor, broke man's disneyland version of a touristy New Orleans wanna be juke joint.  And the food! How dare they not have bone-in chicken breast and decent hot sauce.  It should be against the law to serve fried chicken and not have crystal hot sauce!! The service was absolutely terrible, took over 10 minutes just to get drinks.  The mimosa was just a fancy glass of orange juice.  The food took another 25 minutes, and some how managed to come out cold.  The only thing I liked about this place was the small portions.  You definitely will not over eat... Unless you order two entrees.  All of the food tasted pretty average, the chorizo and salsa appeared to be store bought.  The chicken was not very meaty and over fried. So again ... Blah
