OMG is the sum of the review. I saw Squarz at a farmers market for the first time this year. I didn't get to try their food but it looked amazing. Then I just forgot to go even though they're down the street from me. I went to another farmers market and who did I see again, Squarz. This time I tried a pie. I absolutely love puff pastry and they had so many too choose from. A couple weeks later I was reminded by my friend who went with me to the market, to go to squarz. I wish i would have walked out with more. So good. Amazing and super friendly staff. Will definitely be back.
