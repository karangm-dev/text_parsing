If I could give 0 stars I would!!! I came here for lunch one day with a friend. I had never visited Tempe and she was showing me around town. She was raving about how great this restaurant was. WRONG!!!!! 1) I ordered the Carne Asada fries. They were ehhh. The steak was still very pink/bloody 2) at the END of my meal a ROACH came crawling out off my PLATE!!! The waiter had the nerve to ask if I wanted another plate fixed before I left. Nope! I'm good! Had our meal comped. Will never eat there again!!!
