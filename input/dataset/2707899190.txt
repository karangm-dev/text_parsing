we went to this not knowing what to expect. the food was fantastic. you can make you own bowl and watch it being made infront of you. but what makes this place special is their bartender daniel. his extensive knowledge about alcohol is fascinating. he takes making drinks from just a drink to a art form. he is very passionate about them and when he says he will make the best old fashion you've ever had, be careful because he will and old fashions wont be the same!
