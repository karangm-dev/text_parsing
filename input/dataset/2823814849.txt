After waiting two weeks for a return call, I had one of the owners pull up in front of my house. He never got out of his truck and said that due to the size of my street and with their equipment they would never be able to do this job. I wanted a roof replaced and some leaky skylights repaired. These guys came pretty solidly recommended but sorry I can't say the same. I live on a typical street on top of the southside, parking across the street and rear access. Honestly, I've never seen a guy not want a job any less. He didn't even pretend to attempt to try and figure a way to take the job. Must be nice being able to refuse work so easily.
