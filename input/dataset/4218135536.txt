Very interesting indian fast food concept. Extremely well maintained place. They have the authentic looking electric tandoors. The meet was cooked perfectly. The tikka masala tasted amazing. I loved the rice combo where I got rice bbq chicken and tikka masala as gravy. We also ordered a vegetable masala as a side with wheat naan which tasted good too. I hope they make it a chain
