This was some kinda good! Warm goat cheese and watermelon appetizer, short rib and fried chicken main dishes. Short rib was boneless and huge with delish green beans and cauliflower mash. Fried chicken (1/2) was sooo tender and flavorful. It was our first visit and I'm happy I don't live in Vegas because I would be back more times than my hips would need me to. The peach cobbler was fantastic! Service was impeccable. An absolute must!!!
