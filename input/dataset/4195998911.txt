Disgusting food alert! I am Korean and wow I must say that this restaurant is a huge disappointment! I am Korea and I was expecting at least mediocre food but it was gross. Soup tasted like dishwater and salty, kimchi tasted gross and dumplings were cheaply made with no flavor! I went in hungry and left upset at how I wasted my time and left very disappointed. I am now concerned that I might be food poisoned.... BEWARE!!!
