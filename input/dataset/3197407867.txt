Just had quite the experience at dicks on our vacation in Vegas... Walked towards the restaurant and a lady offered us "two free drinks" obviously we accepted. She handed us two cards and we went right to the bar with them. Told the bartender we had the cards and all he told us was that we needed to run two separate tabs. Being in the business we totally understood because we were giving him two coupons. As we went to cash out he went to hand us a tab of $26. We ordered a side of fries and thought our beers were free so we really should have only paid $6 with tax. All of a sudden tables turned and this free drink card turned into a buy one get one free card. The bartender handled the miscommunication very poorly and gave us a great amount of attitude. We argued back and forth and when I started to ask for his manager he completely ignored me and then finally told me I could go find her myself. Luckily, the manager came right around the corner. She handled the situation very well and I was very impressed with her customer service. If we were to go back it would be because of her but unfortunately we will not be going back due to that bartender and his AWFUL customer service. Find a new job buddy, the restaurant business is not for you.
