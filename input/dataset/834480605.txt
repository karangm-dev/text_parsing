OMG, what a disappointment! Honey Salt tries so hard to be cool and innovative but they fail miserably.Menu - full of those pathetic dishes that feature a zillion ingredients and loose focus (and flavor)Service - seriously amateurish and annoyingWine list - generic and uninspiringAtmosphere and decor - I guess this is their idea of cool but the husband and I agreed that this place could be anywhere in a past-its-prime area of Brooklyn and would blend in perfectly. Again, totally boring.Honey Salt should be called Vanilla. That would be more appropriate.
