Bagels are one of those cultural things people hold on to no matter if bagels are good or bad people will say they are the best in MTL and they convince themselves of the awesomeness.  I am impartial to bagels and I am not from Montreal.  I am completely objective in saying that the bagels here are good... But so are 99 per cent of other places that make bagels.The major factor playing a role in what makes this bagel different if you can notice at all is the the fact that you can grab it straight out of oven unlike Starbucks or Tim Hortons which have to be delivered and reheated.  In conclusion, if this is the best that bagels can be I would say it's worth a go just to say you've been there, done that but don't expect something you've never experienced before.  Especially if you have it built up in your mind that you're face is going to explode with deliciousness like I had.
