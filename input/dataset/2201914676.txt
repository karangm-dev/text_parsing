Horrible.  We wound up paying way more than what we signed up for on line.  Paid over $600 for a car that was originally supposed to be around $265.  My fault for signing....should have just walked away.  Deceptive talking.  Phoenix does have extremely high taxes...but be very careful.. Never, never again.
