I've loved everything I've tried here. They have interesting twists on classic sandwiches and salads. Everything is fresh and delicious! A little pricey especially considering the portion sizes of some of the items, but the quality of the food makes up for it. Very cool atmosphere as well. I also wish the portion sizes of the sides were a little bigger because they're so delicious! Still 5 stars for the taste and atmosphere.
