It pains me to write this, but I am no longer a fan of Vintner Grill.My husband and I were seated a nice table for our anniversary dinner last night.  We ordered a couple of glasses of wine and decided on an appetizer.  In the past, we have ordered cheese plates but we decided to order:*Crispy calamari with haricot verts, lemon and curry aioli ($12)I wish we didn't order it.  It was rubbery and the aioli had a very strange flavor.  After eating two rings of calamari, I had enough of the rubber.  Surprisingly enough, the waiter never asked how the appetizer was. But he did come over to ask what we wanted as a main course.  I'm guessing there weren't any specials of the night, since it was never offered.I ordered:*Seared sea scallops with saffron risotto, english peas, fennel, pea sprouts and roasted pepper relish ($31)-The scallops were MASSIVE and very good.  But the risotto tasted like a box of rice-a-roni (yuck!)  The roasted pepper relish that was on top of each scallop was unnecessary as it caused the inside of the scallops to turn pink, which then makes you think, "could this be raw inside?"My husband ordered:*Durham ranch wagyu sirloin with parsnip puree, baby vegetables and balsamic-port reduction ($27)-He said it was good, but the wagyu at T-Bones at Red Rock (if you can believe it!) was MUCH better.  In fact any wagyu that he has had anywhere else was better than this.We ordered our dessert to go:Which was a trifle with granola, strawberries and pound cake.  It was yummy!There are restaurants in the area that have better food; the ambiance at Vintner Grill is terrific- but that is what you are paying for.Unfortunately, I am no longer a fan and will not be visiting anymore.  Such a shame since I live about five minutes away.
