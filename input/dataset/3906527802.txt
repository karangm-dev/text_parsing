The past 4/5 weeks my dog has come home with more than one puncture wound/scratch on him. When I went in to Camp Bow Wow to ask what was up, they told me "maybe I should hire a trainer" for my dog. My dog (under a year old) goes in his cage when I put my shoes on... never goes to the bathroom in the house...knows all commands... plays EXTREMELY well with the dogs at the dog park; yet he cannot be at camp for one day without getting mauled?! We are never going back. Not only was the customer service here absolutely terrible, it was not worth worrying about my dog EVERY time I was away. Find another dog camp ASAP!
