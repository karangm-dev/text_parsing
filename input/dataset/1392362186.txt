This is one of the best lunch spots downtown for take-out! I love their focus on healthy ingredients, a rarity for a food court establishment. Once, I could see into the back kitchen, and saw these sweet elderly ladies chopping up piles of colorful produce - this was in stark contrast to  the deep fryers and greasy grills in other Arcade eateries.The food is simply wonderful!! I love the noodle soup. The broth is miso-based (perfect for vegetarians) and has lots of delicious buckwheat noodles and fresh vegetables. The fried rice with tofu is also delicious.Two things really stand out to me about this place, other than the healthfulness of its delicious food: 1. It is REALLY inexpensive. I think the fried rice (a big portion) is only about $3, and the soup is $5 or less.2. The owner is one of the kindest people I have ever met. He isn't overly friendly or chatty, but just seems to be a person of great humility and character. His is the kind of business downtown that I really root for. I hope anyone who finds themselves near the Arcade for lunch will give this a shot.
