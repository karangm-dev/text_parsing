I was extremely disappointed with my experience at Maison Mercer. This was my first time celebrating my birthday at a club. I purchased the Birthday Package, which included 3 non-premium bottles, 1 bottle of champagne, birthday décor, custom designed club-wide Snapchat filter, free cover for 15 friends plus ladies free before 12 with bottle service. I used 5 comps to get my male friends in and half of the girls went in before 12. The rest of my party who arrived after 12, were given a difficult time at the door and were rejected because I had no more comps left. I was promised 15 free cover for my friends. The rest of my party had to pay $20 at the door.  I was not given a bottle of champagne as promised in the package nor a custom designed Snapchat filter. There was no birthday décor, only some cheap balloons that happened to be at EVERY booth in the club. Realistically, I just got 3 bottles of vodka (which is the only type of alcohol they had to offer) and 5 comps. No luxury experience as I expected. I was skeptical about booking because of all the negative reviews but I was intrigued by the package and gave it a chance. I would not recommend this club to anyone who wants to have a good time nor will I ever be returning to party here again.
