This place is phenomenal. The staff is famtastic; super friendly, super accommodating. We had a vegan, a vegetarian, and a diabetic in our party and our waitress was able to expertly work with us to make sure we all had appetizers and meals that wouldn't be a problem. The atmosphere of the entire restaurant is also immaculate. One of the best places I've been to in Vegas.
