Be prepared to pay out of pocket, in addition to your co-pay. This place got their $50 co-pay each session from me, and still wanted another $40 for months, until they sent it to collections. I guess they just don't make enough pounding your insurance along with the co-pays????? Well, apparently the PA office is hurting to get EVERY dollar possible!
