If there were zero stars available would choose that rating. Did an online quote request and never heard a thing. Called twice, never reached anyone. E-mailed for follow-up and got a response that agent would call me at 4:30pm that afternoon with quote. Got a DM at 5pm acting like they didn't know who I was and asking if I needed a quote. When I told them who I was and waiting on call and quote got an apology that agent was alone and would respond asap. Next morning when I again prompted them for info agent asked me for my details and promised quote asap again. Nothing all day long. Sent email that night saying "thanks for quote, not" and crickets. Horrible customer service, if this is how they treat potential new customers how do they treat current customers?!?
