Not a fan of the pulled pork or the brisket we ordered on their last day of the season. Both portion sizes were appropriate for the price, but dry and not much flavor.  We will give them another try once they open back up in the spring.Also, Long wait times to order and receive the food.  BBQ should not take 30-35 mins from ordering to receiving.
