Very decently priced place. They didn't have shish tawook or chicken breast on their menu so I was forced to go to Ali baba down the road for my fiance which was a disaster piece of food compared to Wrap and Grab's chicken shawarma. I've been here a few times they are pretty good in timeliness and service and their food is above average as well. I've seen the same people working here over the one or two visits over 3 years.
