It's unfortunate that we won't be coming back even though the food was good. The service was pretty inattentive... After we got seated we waited about 5-7 minutes until anyone brought us water and we made eye contact with several people working there and we were ignored. We saw a couple tables seated after us get their drinks and order even before we got our water. We tried a couple of the eggs benedicts and the crispy pancakes and everything was delicious. The fresh squeezed and pressed juices are extremely refreshing as well. However, the subpar service and crowded room was enough to keep us away. It took several minutes to get to the exit weaving and asking people to scoot in and with a massive crowd of people blocking the entry it must be a fire hazard!
