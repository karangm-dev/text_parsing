Today I just needed to check if a specific Dr. was In-Net-Work to not have any bad surprise when I'll pay my bill. They transferred in a 3 different departments because nobody could help me even I gave all my personal information and saying which was my plan. The last staff was so rude, she hang up the phone when I told her to repeat what she was saying because was speaking so fast. Terrible customer service even we are on PPO plan which is one of the best plan. So disappointed.
