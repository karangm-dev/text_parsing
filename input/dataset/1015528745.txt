When you pose as a high end steakhouse, you must deliver!  Everything started out great but when our waiter, Lance, forgot one of our orders, things just went down hill.  I mean, come on!  Three of our seven guests had the filet and all ordered their steaks at different temperatures.  Every steak was cooked to order but delivered to the wrong guest....I mean come on!!!!  These are the two basic and most important parts of a waiters job.  The only posititve from Lance was his recommendation on wine.  We purchased two bottles of a Malbec...great choice.  Last, the fire alarm went off during dinner.  So annoying.  Typically if a restaurant screws up this bad, something should have been picked up...maybe a bottle of wine or desert, but absolutely NOTHING.  What kind of General Manager are you?  I wish I knew his name.  A tall blonde kid wearing his dads suit.  Haha.....Get it together son!  In Las Vegas, you have many options........DO NOT DINE HERE!!!!!
