WOW!!!! I can't believe the who they let work there. I went in to get a few drinks and some food with some buddies. The waitress, Sarah Y, and the bartender (didn't get her name) were down right rude, vulgar, and just plain awful human beings! Unprofessional does not come anywhere close to it , and not only will I never go back as long as those two twenty something double digit I.Q. twits work there, I will make sure the large groups of friend I go there with stay away. The food is good the beer is cold, but the staff thinks its okay to scream mother F****er with kids eating a few tables away!!! Mentioning it to them not only upsets them, but get you COMPLETELY ignored, along with vulgar four letter mumbles clearly become directed at you from behind the bar. I seriously can't believe the experience there, it was truly unbelievable. For the sake of sane, decent, normal people everywhere AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!!
