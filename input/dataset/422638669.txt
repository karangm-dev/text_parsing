Best hot dog in Cleveland. My standard is a beef hot dog with mole, bacon, habanero pickled onions and tots with ketchup, more mole, garlic aioli, and habanero sauce. A couple of PBR's or #9's and good music to round a perfect evening. The Underdog is also a cool experience, if you want a different type of atmosphere.
