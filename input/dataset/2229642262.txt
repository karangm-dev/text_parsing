The bowling lanes themselves are not bad but dont expect any help or service.  I am part of a stations bowling league and was told I could not have league prices without paying for their league card.  I pay for my league and we were even told that it covers everything.  Service was terrible and girl would not listen or help or anything.  Avoid like the plague!!! Especially with sunset station right down the street.
