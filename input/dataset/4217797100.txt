I went to CDC Chinook for ultrasound. They told me to drink water an hour before which I did. The technician was almost 40 min late. No one called and said that it would be late. I had to sit and be tourchered for almost an hour. It's unacceptable to tourcher people like this. Finally I could not wait anymore went to the bathroom. When technician finally came out she suggested me to do procedure anyway even though she would not see anything. I just don't understand why. Absolutely terrible experience. When you come late 30 min they can't accept you but it's ok if you wait wanting to go to the bathroom really bad. For procedure like this it's not ok to make person wait that long. May be one of them should try to sit and wait in this condition to understand how it feels.
