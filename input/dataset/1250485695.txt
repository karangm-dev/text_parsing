We are coming up to the Spring season. My yard was looking like crap and my flowers looking dead. Call me the plant henchman because I can kill a perfectly good plant. So you can imagine, I'm afraid to buy plants and spend good money on them because I'm just gonna kill em all.My husband and I made our way to the nursery section and started off on the left side where all the cacti were placed. We were thinking of something low maintenance as we had the Summer season also in mind and wanting plants that could handle the hellish Vegas summer.As my husband got quickly bored of looking at cacti, we started to make our way over to the pretty flowers, when Mary showed up. She's so wonderful! We learned a lot from her as my husband pretty much held Mary's attention for over 5-minutes. As you can see, Mary is very patient with novices.With Mary's help and another patron's help, who happened to cut me off to scoop up two sets of the flowers I was looking at, we picked up 8 little pots of flowers full of buds, as the other patron advised us to.  Two weeks later, the flowers, wish I knew what we bought, are blooming nicely. They're so pretty. I go out in my backyard everyday after work just to see how they are doing and enjoy its beauty.Thank you Mary and the unknown patron. My husband and I are falling in love with our backyard
