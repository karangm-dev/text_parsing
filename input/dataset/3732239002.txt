I was having some repairs done to my vehicle and they offered me the loaner, so I decided to get a long overdue pedi. I searched Yelp and came across this salon. I got right in and Kelly was my technician. She was excellent! Anticipated my needs, she was efficient, and courteous. I picked a design out of the photo album and asked for a different color. After an initial application she suggested another shade of the color so it would show up better, and I'm happy she did. As I got into the car, my foot got caught under the peddle and smudged my big toe! Ugh! It was so perfect too. I walked back in and explained what happened and they fixed it, like new! I will be happy to return!  Thank you!!!
