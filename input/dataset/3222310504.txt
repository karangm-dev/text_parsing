This place is large enough for large groups.  They 8 different flavors of agua frescas (flavored fruit water) they also have free chips with 4 different salsas. A large burrito, taco beans, beans , rice and unlimited chips with a water cost me 7.14 with tax.  They have kids burritos as well and several video games for the kiddos.  Truly one of the best Fili-B's (as us locals call it) in the valley.  What gives this Fili's 5 stars is that the INSIDE lobby is open 24 hrs.  7days a week, 365...That made me say WOW, and thus, my only 5 star review so far!
