Very nice venue... but the dumbest rules... first off they make the bartenders pour EVERYTHING in cups even water bottles! That might be the dumbest thing i ever heard of... then when i asked the bartender gave us attitude didn't seem very happy to be working.. sounds like a management issue from what i seen... then when we got to the food the pizza was flimsy and had NO flavor tasted like cardboard the pretzel looked like it was rotating around the oven for a month ... very bad quality and over priced for everything! I would not recommend the food or the bartenders or drinks!  but the venue was very clean.. i would clean house and start all over from the chefs to management.
