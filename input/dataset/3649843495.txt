I gave one star but i shouldn't have gave any. Horrible service. I paid $14 for sandwiches and id just like to say thanks for the BREAD.. I normally wouldn't mind paying anything for Jimmy Johns but being here today was completely disappointing. Dirty, disgusting and highly unprofessional. Never again.  I could go to subway and actually get what i pay for.
