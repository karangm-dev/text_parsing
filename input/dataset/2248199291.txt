We had Polar Air install two units in our home a few months ago. Because of their "inconvenience clause" which actually means what it states, we were completely beside ourselves when they took care of a huge problem that wasn't foreseen until we were notified by Nevada Power. We have never experienced service like that in anything that we have ever done. It was such a breath of fresh air dealing with such an honest and professional company. The trust that we have in them is immense.  Thank You Polar Air, we weren't able to do it in person.  L&M Edwards.
