My nephew and I picked a Sunday night with no games in town so the bar was quiet and we sat at the bar.  This was the final of "Battle Bots" and two other places we had visited that night refused to turn to that channel so we walked into this place.  When asked to turn one of their HD TV's to the finals they were happy to do so and so we placed our orders.      I don't eat meat so in order to give a total review my dinner night included my nephew who loves sports bar wings and is a great chief in his own right.  He ordered wings and onion rings and I wanted to taste the Lake Erie Walleye grilled and a house salad which I should have added shrimp to but forget this time.  My nephew noted that the onion ring batter had some sugar added to it which make diners have to finish the entire order because they are tasty treats.  His review of the wings were that they were better than any others he has tried downtown CLE.  My Lake Erie Walleye was a tasty change of pace for me as a filet because I normally love boned fish.  The lovely chief served the food to the bar and with the "Battle Bots" finals it was a fantastic night for a geek like myself and my sports loving nephew and we will be back again because the bartender and staff treated us like kings.
