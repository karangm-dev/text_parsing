Not impressed.  The matcha is sweetened, which kills the beauty of the flavour.  The team made an unsweetened version for me, that was unfortunately overpowered by the almond milk.  I tried a matcha cookie, that tasted like macaroni & cheese.  Finally, I tried a chocolate/orange roll cake that was nice.  Brilliant branding and vision here - just a few tweaks needed to serve amazing things
