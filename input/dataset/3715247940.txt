Met the owner/baker today when I went in to grab lunch for the first time; and even though he was clearly having a rough day, he was super nice and polite.Got the chicken pot pie and the chicken and mushroom.  Both AMAZING.  I have to say I really appreciate the way they loosely wrap them in aluminum foil and then put them in a paper pocket.  I was a little worried that by the time I got back to my office they would only be lukewarm, but they were still piping hot, and since they weren't sealed in tightly, they weren't soggy at all.  These flaky, delicious pastries were probably some of the best savory puff pastry I've ever had.
