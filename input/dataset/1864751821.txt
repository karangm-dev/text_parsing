Reading the previous posts.. i was eager to give this place a try. Upon walking into the place. I knew it was going to be painfully bad. There was much variety but the amount of food place out for each was minimal. Seafood was not fresh and it was warm. Greasy... food, tables, plates, glass. Taste wise.. only thing that was good was the fruits.If you want to still think Tokyo Sushi Buffet is the best quality with enough variety to make it the best AYCE sushi place in Pittsburgh.
