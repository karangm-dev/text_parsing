Came into the shop in early February to get a simple, small arrow tattoo done on my inner forearm.  Was set up with the shop's visiting artist, Dixer. Had this been my first tattoo I'd be traumatized by this terrible experience from start to finish (what kind of tattoo artist doesn't tell a client about tattoo aftercare?!)  Most importantly, the finished product was terrible - uneven lines, tons of ink fallout, and just overall an amateur, crappy job.  I contacted the shop last week to see what they could do to fix it - the owner, Lee Baxter, at first seemed apologetic and after seeing a picture acknowledged that it needed to be touched up.  However, it's been days since I asked to make an appointment and I haven't heard anything back.  Terrible customer service.  I decided to go to another tattoo shop to get this fixed.  The artist there couldn't believe what a sloppy job was done on my arm.
