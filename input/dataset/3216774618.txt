Really great people that work here.  Fantastic coffee and very clean.   As a business owner you can tell they take pride in their coffee place.   I haven't been here often but was remembered quickly and what I drink.  It was great feeling remembered and the conversations are always fun.   One of the girls that is from New York makes an effort to ask what I do and was genuine and sweet.  Keep up the great work !
