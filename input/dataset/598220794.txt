I've rented their small speedboats quite a few times in the past and once this year. The website mentions that "Our fleet is in great shape...". Well I haven't come across that fleet yet.I'm not sure why I keep coming back here, if it wasn't for my little nephew, I wouldn't. The boats are crap and not well maintained. Slow speed I can understand but I have yet to sit in one of their F13 motor boats that didn't want to, or that didn't die in the middle of the lake. Last time I rented for an hour, they had to come and get me because they didn't put enough gas.Not bad if everything is working fine but take your cell phone with you in case you get stuck in the middle of the lake! Positive: If you don't have one, you don't require a boating license.
