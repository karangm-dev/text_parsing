Needed the seat on my bike redone. Explained I wanted more padding to save some wear on my old man butt. Guy promised they could do better padding and turnaround in a few days. Also promised they would fix it if I wasn't satisfied.Wasn't satisfied... padding was to have been increased over entire sitting area... what I got was a speed hump running front to back. Not much improvement in comfort, which was my primary reason for the reupholster. Took it back to have them 'fix' it. Guys says sure, it will cost another $75...So, I have 2 thoughts... first job was done poorly and if I wanted a seat that looked like I did it myself, I would have done it myself... secondly... if you can fix it for another $75 why couldn't you do it right the first time?Uploaded a pic of the seat (AFTER) Makes you want to hit the highway huh?
