The Salt Cellar is a true gem! They fly their fresh fish and seafood selections flown in from around the world. Clams from New England, Steak from New Zealand, Crabs from Maryland, etc. My first experience was a weeknight in August with a friend. We were fortunate to be seated in Toni's section. Toni is knowledgable, friendly and offered fantastic suggestions. The oysters were incredible, very large and flavorful. It was my first time having turtle soup and I was very impressed - Salt Cellar delivered on all the build up of the controversial dish. The sauteed scallops were exceptional. I tried to request a quart of the sauce to-go, but to no avai. The crowning glory is the Maryland Crab Cakes. They have large pieces of Crab, with only enough of the other ingredients to hold it together. They are grilled to a crispy goodness. I have returned 4 more times, and always order them.The restaurant is an actual cellar, making for fun conversation - be sure to check out the ceiling carefully. The restaurant atmosphere is a balance between upscale and comfortable - great for romantic dinner or family events. On weekends, it's a popular date place. The bar offers a slightly more casual atmosphere. Alex the bartender is personable and makes a great drink.This place is an excellent choice for both tourists, locals and regulars.
