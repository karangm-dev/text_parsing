Sit back, relax and let the southern flavors wash over you!We were inspired by the savory brunch and four-star rating to check out Yardbird. We made reservations with a welcoming hostesses, greeted with smiles at the door and served by a well-informed waiter. We ordered chicken-waffles-watermelon, shrimp and grits, biscuits, the farmers cheese, and a bourbon cocktail. Plenty of leftovers for two. The farmers cheese is lightly grilled and served on a thin slice of watermelon... Delicate and lovely. The biscuits are light and flakey, but substantial... They're jam and bourbon-butter are phenomenal! Checked and waffles are a standard of southern food and Yardbird doesn't skip a beat and, while your heart might with the generous helpings of bourbon-syrup, both the waffles and chicken are crisp and savory. Lastly our grits were served smoother than most recipes, layered on a savory roux and topped with saut√©ed peppers and little strips of bacon. Bring an empty stomach and don't hold any punches for this well-rounded menu!
