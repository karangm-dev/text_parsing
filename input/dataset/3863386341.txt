This stuff is my crack.  I've been dodging my allergies & cold the past few days. The first signs of my allergies I drank a bottle of Local Hottie and Sweet Greens and my runny nose diminished within a two hours. With the type of work I do I'm susceptible to getting sick.  As a night shift respiratory therapist, I have to constantly maintain a healthy diet, but sometimes my schedule is so hectic I don't have time to grab groceries and prep meals. These juices help when I need a quick fix meal & I'm on the go.  I'm hooked.  I love almost all the flavors, especially Green Milk.
