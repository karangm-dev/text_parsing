I have been seeing chiropractors most of my adult life.  The problem was not severe.  An airplane ride or some lifting would result in a back ache that was somewhat relieved through conventional chiropractic treatment.Dr Roles uses what I consider a non evasive treatment with the aid of a computer to treat the whole spine.  Treatment was paid through our medical plan.  First physical sign of improvement was being able to freely move my head from side to side.  The improvement, after 6 months treatment, was so great that I was moved to monthly maintenance.  This is now a reasonable out of pocket expense.  This is definitely a five star.Bill Thornhill
