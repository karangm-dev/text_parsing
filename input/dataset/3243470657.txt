They had great food try the SantaFe Skillet delicious. But they have a tremendous waiter, named David. This gentleman belongs in a 5 Star restaurant with out a doubt, he made the evening for me and my family. The night shift, wow what service. Just go one time you will walk out with a smile, Dennys is really lucky to have this guy:) Wgag a great pleasure, thank you David!!
