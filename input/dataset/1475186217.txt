This place is so good, just smelling its food gave Guy Fieri a hernia. Seriously though, Dor-Stop was featured on Food Network's "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives." Don't quote me for certain on the hernia part, it was probably just a food-boner. Anyways, The Dor-Stop Restaurant is a quaint, classic breakfast and lunch diner. Positive reviews cover the walls, and local businesses advertise on the restaurant's tables and placemats. It is clear how important the restaurant is to the community. While waits can be long, the surrounding streets and stores are very nice to walk through and pass the time. Being a New Jersey (the diner state) native, I'm very critical of my diner experiences. To date, the chocolate chip banana hotcakes may be the best pancakes/hotcakes I've ever had. Not to mention the bacon is deliciously thick and crispy. This is one of the best breakfasts in Pittsburgh. The cheesesteak omelet is phenomenal as well.
