This is a great facility! They have various amenities, including a pool, two skating rinks, gym equipment, an indoor running track, and community rooms to name a few. I've used their community rooms to host group gatherings, and reserved the rink for a community event. The staff are friendly, and very helpful when using their services for my community events.
