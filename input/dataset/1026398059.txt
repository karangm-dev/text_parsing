I had my car detailed today. I am very critical and am a bit OCD. Every time I get my car washed, I find things that were overlooked. I've come to terms with that just being the norm.....until now!!! Rob did such a phenomenal job!! I am 100% satisfied! He didn't miss anything! I couldn't be more happy. My car looks brand new all over again. I highly recommend Rob at All Shine No Grime. Not only is he very detailed, but he's also friendly. Can't say enough good about him!
