I had high expectations but was let down. Nothing wrong with the place or food but nothing to write home about. It seemed like a higher end Mexican place but the food was just "ok". The meat was cooked to mush. The flavor was a bit watered down. Salsas were really nothing special. I had Short Rib and pork enchiladas and a side of chips and salsa. The chips had WAY too much salt on them. Lots of big flakes that made my blood pressure rise. Salsa wasn't as good as most bottled sauces. So for 3 so-so enchiladas, bag of tortilla chips and an iced tea it was $19.....A+ for concept, C at best for food.
