This is an unethical and rude company. Our car got towed while spending money in a business in the shopping center. When we went to pick up the car, the lady at the front was so rude, talking over me and being annoyed that I had questions. She even told another employee that she hates people, right in front of me and my husband. My husband and I have contacted the company (mind you, not demanding a full refund and being very thoughtful) and NONE of our emails have been answered. If I ever need my car towed, I will remember the name Custom Towing and I will avoid them like the plague, and I will tell everyone I know not to use them. If they can't even answer an email, and with employees like that, it tells me they couldn't care less. Uninvolved owners and uninvolved managers.
