The entire experience with Nevada Eye care was excellent. I went through QualSight Lasik, through the NVision program, and was referred to the Nevada Eye Care office with Dr. Parks. From the first appointment, I was qualified for LASIK and already well under way to getting it scheduled. Although the procedure is a bit daunting, it is relatively quick for the result. Dr. Parks and the staff were very professional and well informed on the procedure and let me know everything to expect. I'm now at 20/15 vision and enjoying it each and every day. No more contacts!!!!  I highly recommend Nevada Eye Care and QualSight for LASIK.
