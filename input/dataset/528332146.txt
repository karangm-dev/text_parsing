By best buffet and best deal you mean largest and cheapest then you are correct. However if you want good food for a good price go somewhere else. This buffet is large but the food comes right out of a can. There is absolutely no taste. So if you're looking for a good downtown buffet try the golden nugget. If you're looking for the best then go to the new strip and try Wynn or any of the high end hotels. You can't go wrong.
