I have being bring my vehicle to Performance Auto since I move to AZ in 2011. Recently (2 weeks ago),  I took my car in for service only to find that Todd, Randy or Brian were no longer there, what a total disappointment.  Needless-to-say, I didn't receive the same quality of service I have been accustom to with the other guys. I was told that services I once received were no longer available... Thus, the service I received cost more. I am now stuck with a part that's under warranty, which they refused to change out. I had to use their part.  Only, because it was a Saturday and I had to leave for work on Monday morning which is a commute I paid for the service that I now regret. Today, I took my vehicle into Big O Tires to have my air pressure checked and was elated to find Todd working there... Yeah! I will not be going back to Performance Auto.
