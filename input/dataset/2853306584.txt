As an avid fan of Korean food, I was thrilled to see what this Korean street food joint had to offer. Go Topoki is located in the heart of Yonge and Finch, a very accessible place that is surrounded by variety of other restaurants you can head too if you are feeling something else.The menu has a good amount of dishes that are rice/fish cake based. The serving for each dish is also a lot so you can get multiple things and share them amongst your friends. We ordered the seafood topoki, the regular red topoki and fish cakes in broth, all of them were super yummy and the topoki was deliciously chewy. The service was very attentive and polite, and the restaurant itself is very clean and neatly set up. I also like the aesthetic of the place itself (specially the cute faces they have on their spoons and forks).
