O. M. G. I don't know why this place wasn't just overflowing with people. Not enough good things to say about this place. First of all, I live right down the street and I have no idea why it took so long to finally try it out! Amazing amazing amazing food!!! Great prices and definitely not stingy when it comes to serving sizes! They give you so much food! Hubby and I both ate for a little over 20 bucks. Can't beat it!! Especially for bbq. Can't wait to go back and try everything! Definitely bringing all my family and friends too.
