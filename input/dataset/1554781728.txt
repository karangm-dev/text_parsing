I love Costco.  And as far as I'm concerned this one is the best there is that I have been too.  I shop here for my family and for my business.  The staff is always friendly and get you in out quickly.They also have a great selection of some high end products; plus they carry a large selection of Organic.I brought a beautiful watch there the other day.  And if you don't know it already Costco has the best return policy on the planet.
