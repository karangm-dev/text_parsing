Expect a long wait. I waited about 2 hours just to be seen. Bring a book or laptop or sleeping bag!  The Waiting room was full of people who were restless (a few even sleeping) because they'd been waiting for so long.  Also, when standing at the window to ask a question, it seems they purposely turn their backs or heads so as not to appear to see you so they don't have to acknowledge you. 4 people milling about the office and over 7 minutes for them to acknowledge me standing there. Only Good thing is, parking is easy and convenient.
