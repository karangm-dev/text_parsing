We thoroughly enjoyed the Pork Hash (kinda like big pork shu mai's)Breakfast combo (Spam, portuguese sausage, 3 eggs, and rice)OmeletteChow Fun (It's not the thai/chinese style chow fun flat noodles)Katsu Overall, we thought the Pork Hash, Breakfast combo, and Katsu were really good. The Breakfast combo was really delicious because the spam was cooked nicely and tender, not over fried or dried out. The rice was perfect; some places make the rice mushy, but this was great!  The omelette was good and fluffy. The Chow Fun was good but just a different type of noodle than I was expecting. (They are thicker than the flat chow fun noodles, and very chewy which I like)Will definitely be going back soon to try more stuff!!!!!
