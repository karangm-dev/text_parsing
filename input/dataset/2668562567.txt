Just got a delivery from them.  Probably the worst  Naam Tok and Laab I've ever had.  Both pork dishes lacked flavor and spices.  In Naam Tok the pork chunks were too thick and tasted boiled.  There was no hint of lime and zero mint leaves which generally are added to these dishes. I'm ok with them having a different recipe, but at least make it flavorful. The egg rolls were reasonably good.  Seafood Salad $15, had several pieces of squid, few mussels, and few shrimps.  The shrimp were large.  Seafood was cooked perfectly, but again, the flavors didn't come together and it was just bland.  Onion pieces were cut too big and were larger than seafood itself.  Very disappointing.
