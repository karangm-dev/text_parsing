I'm a repeat Optic Zone customer and fan.  I've been going here for years, as a result of the old fashioned referral system.Why do I endorse this store... it comes down to a few things really.  First off, the prices are fair, if not great for designer lens, and you won't bust the bank.  I have yet to find cheaper designer glasses in Toronto.  Second, selection is excellent.  They don't just carry a few brands, they seem to be always mixing it up with even lesser known designs from around the world. Thirdly, Joe (Optician) is great at what he does, and he'll ensure the glasses you pick match the natural features of your face.  He is also very patient, which is a must for a good shopping experience.To be honest, Joe has chosen a few pairs for me, that I would not of chosen myself, that ended up being great buys.Service, style, selection.  This place is great.
