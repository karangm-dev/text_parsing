I am a HUGE fan of Papa Chang's! It is hands down the best Taiwanese restaurant in the GTA that I've tried. Unfortunately the express location doesn't offer the same quality or quantity of food as the other locations. I had the Taiwanese sausage with minced pork on rice, and my sausages were tiny! My fiance got the braised pork bento box, and you could tell that the sides were reheated and even the sauce was kind of jelly-like. It was still good, but definitely under performs the 16th/markham rd and richmond hill locations.
