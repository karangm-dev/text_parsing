Still drooling and licking my fingers... I have been going to Nevada Chicken Cafe for over 8 years.. almost daily when I lived in the area up until 2012...I just got into Vegas on business this week.. after over 3 years away and yearning for the sensational taste of the Mesquite BBQ Chicken and Ribs.. and my "custom side dish" (combination of Sweet Potato and Saffron Rice)...Actually... I found the place has had a full face lift.. with major improvements to the patio, and the parking lot.. AWESOME.. As well as a revised interior seating and ordering area.. all great upgrades that provide an extremely family friendly environment from the seating to the order menus to the well uniformed and informed STAFF... i NOTICED AND REMEMBERED THAT MOST OF THE STAFF ON DUTY WERE THE SAME CREW FROM YEARS AGO!!! That alone speaks for the consistency of the restaurant performance and ownership.New cooking equipment... especially a rotisserie type BBQ for the ribs.. resulted in even MORE JUICY AND TASTY RIBS.  The chicken was well cooked and Juicy at the same time... The custom side I love so much and have had sooooo many times in the past WAS EVEN BETTER THAN I REMEMBER IT!!!But don't believe me.. eating is believing.. ride, run or walk over TODAY AND TASTE FOR YOUR SELF...God Bless.. them with many more years of success... Spread the LOVE.. I highly recommend this place....!!!!!
