This place has been remodeled and looks nice, especially from the outside. They have a huge selection of stores. Always a ton of tourists and tour buses. The one thing that really bothers me and prevents me from giving it a higher rating is all the kiosks in the middle of the narrow walkway. So many vendors bothering me to try a lotion or a steamer. I just want to shop and not be bothered. If you can get passed that and the crowds...it's not too bad.
