If only I could give it less stars. The place was absolutely disgusting. We didn't even dare walk barefoot in the room. We stayed one night then left for a different hotel. We have stayed in cheap roadside motels that were nicer than this pit. The carpet was stained in multiple places; there were massive holes in the walls in the hallway along with more stains. We had a nonsmoking room with cigarette burns and ashes on the floor. There was also broken glass on the floor. The bathroom floor looked like it hadn't been mopped in ages -- there was a black sticky patch right in the middle of the floor. And the smell. I would describe it as very musty; my fiance said it smelled like piss.
