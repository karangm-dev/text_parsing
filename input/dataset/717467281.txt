WHY oh WHY? cant I have a Peppermill in San Diego?! the 10 egg omelette was so huge I felt bad for all the starving people in the world! The portions are crazy big..even the coffee is served in a huge mug! THUMBS UP for french vanilla creamer! I think the first customer was the jolly green giant and they just never changed the portion sizes! The waiter was super cool and nice. I forgot his name.."sorry cool dude", but he was telling us jokes and gave us advice on ordering one meal for two. That was very nice of him because he was soooooo right! My husband decided to make up his own alcoholic beverage that didnt have a name so the bartender was nice enough to come to our table and treat him like VIP mixing his drink the way he wanted..so either she came because she was super nice like the waiter or she wanted to get a look at the weirdo (aka my husband) that didnt know the name of the drink he was thinking of! haha Anyway. We had a full family mixed with adults and kids and everybody was very nice to us. Got our food fast (I think about 9 of us total and our food was ready in about 20-25mins) We all were pleased and fat at the end of the visit. It was clean. great atmosphere. tasty food. good drinks.GREAT pricesWe LOVED the fake trees inside and the confetti crystal sugar shaker that I....I mean somebody thought about stealing.I think this is the only place we will eat next time!Enjoyed my visit on 12/24/2010
