Under new management and it shows! Great new selections, daily hot bar deli and prompt, amazing service. If you haven't been here, GO! Fresh and can be cut to order and prices are competitive to any local store. If you have been in the past, you may want to check out the new offerings...It is bringing back old school delis! PS. The Jacobson potato salad is the best we have ever had!
