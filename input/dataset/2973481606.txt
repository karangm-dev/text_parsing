I'm disgusted with how terrible this practice is, everything from the office staff to the doctors.  I was having a chronic migraine (the reason I am seeing a neurologist) during my appointment. I threw up in the waiting room for an hour before being called. I then passed out trying to walk into the area where they take your blood pressure. The lack of knowledge displayed from the entire staff baffled me. Thankfully my mother was with me and able to assist in waiting for me to regain conciseness. I then waiting for 20 minutes before anyone came in to check on me. Doctor Lovell walked into the room, sat down with his back facing me, and began to type on his computer. He never looked at me or examined to ensure I was okay. He simply told me they could call an ambulance and send me to the ER. I told him these are how my migraines are and it was the reason I was coming to see him. My mother had to borrow a wheel chair to get me out of the office, not one member of the staff offered to assist. I curled up in a ball in the wheel chair and waited for 5 minutes at the check-out desk as the receptionist was busy drinking her blender ball. I had to wheel myself outside to throw up again because the pain was so bad.  The lack of knowledge, compassion, and assistance at this office is sick. Over everything, basic care for another human being was foreign to their entire staff. Also.. You will wait 1 to 2 hours past your appointment time. PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE.
