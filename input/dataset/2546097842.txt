I really want to love this place. It has cute homey decor, is right in the neighborhood, and could work for a romantic date or a family night out. I think we've given it four tries now, and sadly, it just seems to be going downhill. The first night we had great service and okay food. I appreciated the eggplant Parmesan, which was bright and not fried. The calamari was decent. And in both of these dishes, the marinara was delicious. On subsequent trips we ventured out and tried picatta and parmigiana style veal or chicken and the meat has been overcooked, tough, and greasy. On the most recent trip with the kids, the marinara sauce seemed to be days old...and not in a good way. My daughter ordered mozzarella sticks that came with this sauce. And I ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana again. The eggplant was fine, but the sauce that topped it and the side of spaghetti was thick, dark, and not fresh. There have been problems with the service on all subsequent trips. I really hope they can get it together, but sadly, I don't think we'll be back.
