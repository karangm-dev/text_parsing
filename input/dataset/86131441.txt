Do not go! I went in for hilights and a cut and between the student and her teacher, no one could get it right. My hair turned WHITE from over processing it (she took way to long after the foils) and then after the terrible hilights were finished she told me they had to leave soon so she wouldn't have time to cut my hair! She didn't care that I wasn't happy or offer to do anything. I don't remember her name but she was Asian and petite. I do NOT recommend her or the school at all unless you want to risk a horrible job, wasting your day, and being rushed out with a bad attitude. I'd rather pay much more for someone with some experience and class. You definitely get what you pay for going to a beauty school versus a real salon.
