I found this place here on Yelp and saw really good reviews. So, we decided to go try them. This restaurant is cute and little. Very well decorated and the hostess/waitress (wife of the chef) she was very nice and helpful. I got the bread pudding fruit French toast, very delicious! And also very filling lol, I took home half. My husband got the burger with tots. He was very happy with his good :) we also saw the chef so it was pretty cool to see him communicating with his guests. We will back :)
