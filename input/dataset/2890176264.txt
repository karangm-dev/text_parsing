This company is terrible. The lady in the office is a class A bitch and they try and screw you all the time. I paid rent through my bank and the second to last month they "lost" my check and charged me $110 in late fees, and gave me a 5-day notice. Then at move out I spend 4 days cleaning the house, cleaning the walls that my roommate scuffed up and every corner of the house. The only thing I didnt do was carpet cleaning but you have a non-refundable 250 cleaning fee which is understandable. well they charge me around 400 in cleaning. Lastly they altered the paperwork that I signed at the final walk through and charged me other BS charges.
