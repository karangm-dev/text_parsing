Despite some negative reviews, I had high hopes for Piano Piano. Unfortunately our experience was a major let down. Here's why.Service: poorly timed and inconsistent. First dish was practically dropped and dashed. It should have been the oysters on the half shell but instead we had no idea what it was and actually thought it was a complementary amuse bouche. After asking what it was we discovered it was the poorly named appetizer of gnocchi fritti. It looked like deep fried ravioli with some meat sauce covered in chopped endive. 20 minutes into our meal, the same dish was served to us again by a different server. Food: let's just say we turned away the mistaken second order of gnocchi fritti. It was dry and over fried, the andouille sausage (what? There's andouille sausage in this???) was far too spicy and the chopped endive was just - wrong. Oysters (which should have been served first) were the most pathetic, withered up little Malpeques I've ever seen. And the accoutrement was nothing special. No horseradish in the entire restaurant apparently. Burrata cheese was pretty good. Pasta limone was plain and looked like it was ordered off the child's menu, but tasted okay. Ambiance: tables are jammed together along the wall. My head kept hitting the canvas paintings on the wall behind me. Candles on the table would have been a nice touch. Decor somewhat tacky. The groups singing happy birthday certainly didn't elevate the sophistication of the place. Other: hand dryers in bathroom didn't work. I can understand that restaurants can have an off night and at times I'm willing to give it another chance. Not this time.
