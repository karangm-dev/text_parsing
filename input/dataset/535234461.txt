Been going to this place for over a year...the service this last month or so has gone down hill.  Bartender stuck fingers in one of our drinks and when told about it owner was rude and confrontational...it's sad because the food generally is pretty good but the worst management I have ever experienced, made us feel like we did something wrong.  After asking to replace the drink he came outside and stared us down.  Unfortunately we will not be back!  There are plenty of other places with nice patios to go to and enjoy great service and good food!
