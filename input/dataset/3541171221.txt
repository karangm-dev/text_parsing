Kinda sad how badly this place has failed. The food is hit or miss. mostly miss.  The service is decent. Attentive at first but when the peak hour arrives, they are a little lost.  Food plating is awful.  I wonder how much longer both the restaurant and Caesars has to put up with each other.  This place clearly needs to be undone.  No more fusiony hollywood type Chinese food please.  Just put in a premium high end Chinese place.
