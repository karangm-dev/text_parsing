I am only updating my review because this place never ceases to amaze me.  Had the wonton soup which came in a bowl large enough to feed four.  Unfortunately, I didn't know the size and ordered it just for myself.  The broth was light, non-salty but flavorful.  There was a generous number of  wontons with their porky goodness.  Some of them dislodged from the meat but who cares... I do have a spoon to rescue them don't I?   I also ordered the onion pancake (aka scallion pancakes in other places).  Sooooo good---not greasy.... just right.  We ordered the chicken fried rice super spicy and I will tell you they were not afraid to turn up the heat.  I couldn't believe the portion size!  Another dish was the orange chicken which we requested without the typical breading.  It was amazing to see how they accommodated that request without blinking an eye.  It was delicious and generously portioned.  We cleaned our plates with the exception of the wonton soup which we brought home.  Who says you can't have wonton soup for breakfast?  I just did!  The place was packed when we arrived and yet they managed to serve us at a good pace. The food was really, really good.... maybe that's why I bothered to update my review and give them the 5 stars they deserve.
