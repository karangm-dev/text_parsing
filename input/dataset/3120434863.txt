I absolutely love Bahama bucks, we were there last night, and we had an amazing time. It would take about two years to try every flavor on the menu. If you decided to eat your shaved ice, smoothie or ice cream at the location there are several table top games you can play, such as uno, connect four, and chutes and ladders. This is a wonderful spot to take the entire family for dessert
