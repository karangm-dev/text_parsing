These guys cancelled my reservation AFTER I checked-in online.  I arrived several hours later to stay for the night and was told very impolitely that they were sold out.  The female desk attendant actually yelled at me then told the manager (who I asked for) that I had used threatening language toward her and demanded a room.  Never happened.  The manager looked very confused.Turns out they were NOT sold out, rooms were available.   This shows just what Platinum Elite status with Marriott will get you.   I've stayed 89 nights with Marriott in the last year.  It means nothing to them.This was by far the most unprofessional experience I have ever had with any hotel chain.
