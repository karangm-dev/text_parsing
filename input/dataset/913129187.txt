I called to ask if they would be able to do a fridge pickup even though I did not have an account that they could bill me. The lady I spoke with placed me on hold to figure out the information and said I could and made an appt to pick the fridge up on a Tuesday from 8 to 5 and would bill me through credit card or by mail. I live in a condo and on the day of pick up I called and wanted to let them know I left the fridge out on the curb. The gentleman said that there was nothing on file for a pickup, if i didn't have an account it wasn't something that they do, and their bulk pickup is on Thursdays. He apologized for the false information and that they could trace the call. At this point I was frustrated because it sounded like I wasted my time moving the fridge and was lied to. I asked what the benefit for me for you to trace the call? He said to prevent this from happening again and that I could possible make an acception. They traced the call while I was on hold and apologized again for the false information the lady provided and since I don't have an account to get billed they couldn't help me. So twice they wasted my time and couldn't help me.
