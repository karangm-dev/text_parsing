I love this neighborhood coffee shop. It's really close to my future home! My husband and I had the chance to grab a cup of coffee and a muffin. We spoke to whom I might assume was an owner about the neighborhood. She was well informed and it seemed like she knew most people that walked through her door. I can't wait to go back!
