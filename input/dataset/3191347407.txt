Just noticed this place a couple weeks ago when I was in the area. So, I decided to give it a try for lunch today. The food was excellent and very inexpensive. I got the chicken chimichanga lunch special for $5 and it came with rice and beans, also. You can choose from cheese sauce or red sauce -I chose the cheese sauce, of course (true Wisconsinite).The service was prompt, the restaurant was clean, the food was great, and the waiter was very nice. I definitely plan to stop in for lunch, again.
