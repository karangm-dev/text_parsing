My husband and I recently had the opportunity to dine here and this restaurant was absolutely amazing.We started with the Roasted Bone Marrow, which was a new experience for both of us and while it sounds distasteful to some, the presentation was beautiful; still in the bone and paired with sardines, which complimented each other perfectly. It was also accompanied by a visit from the manager who spoke with us a while and gave a proper background on how it was prepped and more information on the idea of marrow itself.We then ordered Burrata Agnolotti and Chicken Rollatini Parmasean for our main entrees and then a beautiful creme brule for dessert.The staff was attentive and courteous and the manager visited a few times and made us feel extremely welcome. Their seating/couches are lovely. I would definitely recommend Portofino to anyone who is looking for a romantic dinner out. .
