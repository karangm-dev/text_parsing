What a hidden gem!  Hiding on the west side, down freedom drive, is a great seafood restaurant.  It's also a seafood market, with a good selection.Don't be fooled by the seemingly limited menu, they can and will cook anything you want.  If they have it in the market, they will cook it for you any way you like.My wife got 1/4 pound small shrimp fried Cajun style, and really enjoyed it.  The breading was the perfect consistency, not to thick.I got the low country boil small plate and everything was delicious.  It comes with 10 shrimp, potatoes, corn and sausage.  The seasoning was strong without taking over the dish.  Everything was cooked to perfection.We just moved to the West side and will be making this a regular stop.
