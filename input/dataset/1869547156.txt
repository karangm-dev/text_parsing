I've been going to Don Nobis for a little over two months. He is one of the sweetest doctors I've seen.  The other therapists Mark and Matt are just as nice and I never thought my pain would go away.  But surely it has.  It's still there but compared to where I was we've made major progress. I had went to another therapist Matt Smith. They ignored me and gave me stuff I could do at home.  Here at Don's practice they take care of you.
