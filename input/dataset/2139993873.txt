Fun play area with a couple of unique concepts I haven't seen before. SAFETY FIRST - When you enter, you and your child are stamped the same number on your hand. And the number is checked before you exit so you can not walk away with someone else's kid! Love the idea. There are attendants constantly walking around and monitoring the kids. FUN FOR PARENTS - The waiting lounge for parents has complimentary tea and coffee, awesome massage chairs, elliptical machine and there is a walking track with weights!PLAY AREA - The actual play area has a wide selection of activities to keep kids of all ages entertained. Including a toddler area for below 3 year olds, arts and crafts station and a nail painting station. Remember to bring socks for yourself and your kids. COST - USD 10 per child. Adults free. My toddler was well entertained and my husband got a great massage while working on his laptop in the lounge! Bonus!
