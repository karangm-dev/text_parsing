I found a coupon on Groupon because I needed my apartment cleaned. I've got a bad hip and back and couldn't take trash downstairs to the dumpster, and it needed general cleaning. I come home after the "cleaning" to find that a lot of the trash that I had bagged up for them to take was still in the apartment AND they had broken a ceiling fan and left my freezer door open, with a pool of water on the kitchen floor and over $100 of frozen food destroyed. I e-mailed them for a refund and have not heard back. To say I'm disappointed and LIVID is a huge understatement.
