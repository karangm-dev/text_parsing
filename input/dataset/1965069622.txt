Every time I go (just about every week) is great! I've never had a bad experience, even though they change their employees very often. The froyo flavors change every couple days, except the original tart and 2 other flavors (don't remember). Make sure you get their waffle cup (made fresh). They have a giant array of candies to top off your yogurt from sour patch kids, chocolates, and reeces pieces! They also have fruit, mochi, and popping flavored boba. On top of that, they have sauces like chocolate, caramel, and marshmallow. They also sell apparel, lip balms, pins, etc if you're into that kind of stuff. If you are a part of a club, sport, or organization, you can fundraise here. Stop by to grab a brochure!Monday- Friday from 11am-2pm (don't quote me on that) it's happy hour so it's half price. Also, I got a coupon that is buy one, get on free, but if your total is over $5, you only get $5 off. Come here and you won't regret it except maybe your wallet because you'll get addicted!!!
