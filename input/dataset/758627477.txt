Not only is Malley's adorable and decadent as it is (I grew up in Mentor, and that place was a step higher than Toys R Us), THIS Malley's has tables inside of a (very) slow-moving carousel. Seriously? Adorable.I could tell kids loved it, and "big" kids like my friends and I in our mid-20s had a ball, too. I  will have to make some more special trips to visit this location :)
