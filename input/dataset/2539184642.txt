Not to take away from a local legend such as Premanti Brothers, but when we had one night in Pittsburgh on a film shoot, the option came up to go out to eat and one of the non-local regulars suggested Sienna Mercato.  Everything on the menu look good but I proceeded to go with the Dragon Balls... I'm sure an homage to Game of Thrones. What a wonderful and fun place after dinner we proceeded to the rooftop for drinks and the other business establishment and had a blast.
