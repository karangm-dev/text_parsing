I stopped here on a house hunting tour. I was tired and hungry. I sat down to a quiet meal. I ordered a Stella on tap and chicken tikka masala. The food was good; the beer was cold. I was starting to relax....BUT....A family walked in with a baby and a 2 year old. The two year old would not stop screaming. He was obviously tired and needed to be at home. Both parents were oblivious to this and sat there anyway. The waitress didn't help...she went to play with the baby. By this tine, the restaurant was crowded with ADULT diners. This family disrupted every single diners' meals with their screaming children.To make matters worse, I wasn't even halfway through my meal when the waitress slapped the check on my table and told me to notify her if "I needed a box". 5 minutes later, another waitress picked up the bill and asked if "I were ready to cash out". No, I am not finished with my meal!!!! Good grief. Persis, good food, could be great atmosphere, but wow....
