Jon just finished cleaning the gutter at our house and did an excellent job. I'm from California and recently relocated back to our family home here in Pittsburgh where we had a tenant who didn't pay rent for a year and was evicted the prior month. The house was an absolute mess and that included the gutters. My parents are old and we didn't have a ladder tall enough to reach the gutters for me. I looked on Yelp for a gutter cleaning service, and Jon was very speedy in his response and amiable. He arrived early this morning, sent both a Yelp and Text Message before showing up (much appreciated!). My mom even asked him to do some extra work (like a nail that was hanging off the gutter) and Jon was kind enough to nail those in. He even washed the windows :] He took out 2 garbage bag full of whatever was in those gutters, and properly disposed them off the property :DJon was timely, pleasant, very nice and professional. My parents loved him. I would highly recommend h2oTeks!PS: Hope you had a great time in Colorado and thanks so much for doing such a wonderful job~!
