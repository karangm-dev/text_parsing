Fantastic selection of high quality breads baked fresh every day from their commercial on-site bakery.They must deliver to many big hotels, restaurants & grocery stores in Las Vegas.I got their seeded rye bread which was absolutely perfect! A huge sliced loaf 4x the size of the Rye bread at Panera ($4.59) for less at $4.25!
