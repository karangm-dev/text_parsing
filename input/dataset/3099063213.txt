The menu is fresh with a great selection of beers and a rotating list on tap, the food is good and the decor is fun and unique but what stood out the most was the customer service. We had two beers and two appetizers and one beer was a little late and so was one appetizer (30 min late). We didn't complain but when our server realized what had happened she immediately sent the manager over who came to make sure we were having an ok time. And then he comped our entire bill and even asked our server to offer us free dessert. We declined and were impressed at the efforts they made to make the situation right. This is a place you won't be dissatisfied with.
