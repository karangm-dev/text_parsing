I can't say enough good things about Dr. Joe, Gaylene and the rest of the amazing staff at True Dentistry.   First I need to share that many years ago I had a VERY bad experience with a dentist that instilled a deep phobia about dentists in general.  Just thinking about going to a dentist made me nauseous.  My wife found True Dentistry and after seeing them came home glowing with how great they are.  Well, reluctantly I went and WOW am I glad I did!  From the moment you walk in to their elegant offices, you're greeted warmly and professionally.  Everything that they use is state of the art high tech gear.  They use the most noninvasive technology you can imagine which makes the entire process SO much easier, quicker and  more enjoyable.If you're looking for an amazing Dentist look no further!
