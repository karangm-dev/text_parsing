This is like one of my favorite restaurants around this region. I love the fact that it's really inexpensive, has large portions, and a great atmosphere.Environment:The restaurant is located at the exterior corner of the Times Square plaza, but  to find parking it is better to go inside the plaza. There's lots of space.The restaurant itself is modern, nicely removed. It is a casual dine out. The seats are like those of HK style restaurant, so it's better to come in a small group of 4 or less. Larger groups would need to merge tables in a long row. Food:I usually order their house special, which is you build your own order from selecting the soup base, the toppings, the noodle type, and the drink. It's only $9.99, comes in a gigantic bowl, and comes with a hot complimentary drink on the side. Bubbles teas are around $2-3 extra but they do come in large size and in take out container cups. I really recommend their peanut soup base, the favor is amazing and you can really taste the peanuts. If you don't like parsley and green onions you can elect to have those removed. All of the soup bases also comes with tofu skin and bok choi, and those can also be removed by checking a box.I like that the menu is nicely translated so I can bring my English speaking friends with me to this restaurant.Service:I mean you shouldn't really expect superb service at a casual Chinese restaurant. I always find them to be under staffed. The waiters are also busy, so make sure you wave you hand high so they can notice you.
