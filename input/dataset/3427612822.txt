Update - it's been over two months. I received an email from the assistant general manager on June 10 and responded via the phone number left for him. I did not receive a call back. Today I finally reach the general manager who acknowledge the accident and is finally turning this over to their insurance company. The jury is still out as to how this will be resolved. I'm not a litigious person - but I feel that the holiday inn should be paying for me to seek further medical attention for the injury caused by their negligence.
