Was my go to bubble tea place in mississauga but I feel like the quality has gone down. The food and drinks here is really disappointing when I get take out. They either mess up my order or give me burnt food. It went downhill since Chatime showed up. If you try calling to place an order after 11pm. Save your time. They turn off their phones. Dine in is still okay but service is not that great.
