Good prices, quick service, honest guys. Didn't have an exact match for my tire (old car, hard-to-find size) but made it work by rotating back to front and putting a slightly larger size on the back. No charge for that or the balancing, and just $35 each for two used tires.UPDATE: OK, scratch that good review. Tire I got from them blew out just four days after getting it. Split along the rim. I know most used tire shops have a "no warranty" policy, and Loredo prints theirs right on the receipt. But most places will be cool if they see they sold you a defective tire so soon after putting it on. Not so with this place.Next time I'm going back to D & D Tires (just down the street -- 2458 E Bell Rd). Always good customer service from Fatboy and the guys.2nd UPDATE: The 2nd tire went flat after 6 more days. Avoid this place for tires.
