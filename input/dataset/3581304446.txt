I have the admit that when we first pulled up I was skeptical. Don't let the outside appearance fool you. The inside decor gives it a classic 50's diner feel, the diner is very clean & the service is fantastic. You will walk out with a full belly at a great value. Our family enjoyed it so much, we came back the following morning for round two. We will be back again someday when we're visiting the Toronto area. Friendly atmosphere & it's clear they take pride in their place.
