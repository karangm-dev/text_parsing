Love this location. Ever since transition from paradise to Panera, I've been a big fan of stopping in when I'm out and about. No matter how busy it is, you always seem to be able to find a table and your food comes out super quick. When you order pick up, the food is waiting for you when you get there. No waiting in line. No unclear ordering procedure. Smooth and simple. Just the way it should be. They also have the best oatmeal raisin cookies in all of the valley and if you are as into them as I am, don't forget to ask about the "buy 6, get 6 free" :). Such friendly staff as well. They have their own delivery service now too. Yes they have a delivery fee but their fast and it beats having to pay the extra fee for third party drivers. (Postmates, door dash, Uber Eats). Thoroughly impressed. Will be back soon.
