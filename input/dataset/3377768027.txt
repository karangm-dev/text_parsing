THEFT THEFT THEFT. This is a very shady operation.  Every time my back was turned, the 3 movers this company sent me were stealing things.  THEY WORK AS A TEAM, distracting you so that they can search through your boxes of valuables and take whatever they think they can sell at a swap meet, Craigslist, or whatever.  Horrible, horrible horrible.FYI, this company switches up their name so they're not strictly linked to this company name that has an F (the worst you can have) rating with the BBB.If you want to see your valuables again, DO NOT use this company.  I will update with the other names this company uses.  They do this to try and disguise their bad reputation under different company names.
