I've always been interested in formal dancing especially being in the wedding and photography industry! Arthur Murray makes it easy and makes every lesson a great experience!I always look forward to spending my Monday & Thursdays here with my amazing instructor, Maybelline who effortlessly and smoothly guides our lessons, her positive upbeat and infectious laugh always makes our lesson so much fun!
