Had an amazing lunch here a while back! The lineup for this food truck usually isn't as long as some of the other ones, and you get your food fairly quickly, which is definitely a plus, since food trucks are generally supposed to be fast. I got the DBL (not the combo) for $8 and it was amazing. The DBL is two pieces of schnitzel with cheese, bacon, sauerkraut all inside. Especially since I'm not the greatest fan of bread or buns, this sandwich/burger was simply perfect. Although the DBL looks small initially, it will fill you up for a nice lunch and the schnitzel is done to perfection - not too oily, but still very crispy and satisfying. But be prepared though, this isn't a salad or an extremely balanced meal, so if you're looking for some greens, then it might be better to save this for cheat day.
