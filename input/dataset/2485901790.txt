Just visited today. They make it really easy to donate and also provide receipt slips for donation tax stuff. The donation port is in the back. You can just pull into the port and then put your donations into the bin. From what I remember, they really do have a lot of good stuff. I got a lot of my stuff from St Vincent's when I needed temporary kitchen ware for college. The selection and sales space can be very hectic and packed, but i don't mind it.
