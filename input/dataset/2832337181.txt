I really wanted to love this conveniently located pizzeria inside SLS Las Vegas Hotel. Let's just start by saying, I'm from Chicago, so I'm not easily impressed when it comes to other pizzerias when I'm away from home...but I digress. I ran into four women, varies ages, but strolling together through the casino, carrying individual pizza boxes from 800. I stopped one of the ladies to ask her about the pizza and she went into a hallelujah chorus about it...and the other three joined the choir. I didn't know them, but based on their enthusiasm alone, I decided to give it a try. The ordering process was easy enough. There are pre-selected topping choices, or you can create you own. You start with the crust, select a sauce, proteins and topping/fixings. I ordered the sausage and caramelized onion pizza. They restaurant has a wood-fired brick oven, so the waiting time was less than 10 mins tops. When I got to my room, my mouth was watering with anticipation, so I opened the box and dove right in. I'm not sure what all the hype was about, but this was the most tasteless, seasonless pizza I had ever eaten. Although my pie contained fresh mozzarella, it wasn't melted uniformly. The sausage was ok, but did not adhere to the cheese, so most of the meat just rolled right off. The crust...and this is how I judge all pizzas..was disappointing.  Although it wasn't thin to my personal liking, it was thin enough, but soggy, perhaps due to the thin sauce. This experience really disappointed me, not only because I was really hungry, but I felt this property should be able to offer award-winning Neapolitan-style pizza.  It hurts me to say, I will not be returning.
