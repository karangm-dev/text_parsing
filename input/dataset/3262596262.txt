i only had an hour to eat, and i quickly yelped this place and went today. As everyone else has been saying, the manager was awesome and i just straight up asked him what was the best. Got the combo plate with chicken, meat jun (i think beef with egg around it?), and kalbi. SOOOO good. I told him I loved veggies so he gave me all the traditional Korean veggies and refilled them! He was really sweet and came over with sirracha sauce later for me. I was albe to eat in literally, 30 min, but this was also at 3pm on a weekday! i'm from NC and was just visiting and i'm so glad i came here instead of eating something quick at a wendy's! Meat was perfectly cooked, seasoned and hot!!! :)
