My daughter's father passed away not to long ago. She is only 7 years old and she will be growing up without a father figured. I didn't know anything about Probate and the stress that was left behind. I hired Attorney Craiq Stone to help with the process because he didn't leave a will for his only daughter. PLEASE DO NOT HIRED HIM AND HIS COMPANY!!!!! They love to take your MONEY. You will be charged and overcharged for the B/S services. I am very disappointed and they made the Probate for stressful than it is.
