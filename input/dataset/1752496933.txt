Went for a tan yesterday afternoon and paid $40 for a 10 mins session for one of the beds and came out looking the same as I did when I came into the salon. I decided to wait a day to see if my colour would darken, but nothing has changed. The lady at the desk advised me that since I already have naturally brown skin that the bed she recommended would definitely give me the colour I was hoping to achieve (told her that I wanted to look like I just came back from vacay - I tan easily, so I usually don't need to do more than 1 session) ... So disappointed that I wasted that much money and came out without a noticeable tan. Giving 2 stars because the salon is really clean.Edit ***I was contacted by Luxe Tanning and was offered a complimentary session with a lotion and eye wear. The bed they recommend this time was perfect. I got great colour this time around. They also didn't make it awkward when I came in to redeem the complimentary session. They were super cool and walked me through all the fancy options. Definitely looking forward to coming back !!! 5 stars for the great customer service !!!
