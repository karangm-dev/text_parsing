As a visitor from Chicago and only experiencing one froyo joint--I was looking forward to visiting Yogurt Land than any other activity we had planned. This is the reason why I will move to Arizona. Yogurt Land has a very diverse set of yogurt flavors, and an array of toppings.For only $.30/oz. it was so inexpensive for such a large amount of goodness! They only have one bowl, so you determine the pricing. Obviously, the more toppings/fro-yo you put, the more it'll be... but honestly who looks at price when you know you're about to indulge in greatness?Go visit, please !
