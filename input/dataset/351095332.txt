Headed in for lunch.  This was my second time to buldogis.  Everything was even better this time around! It's really cute inside.  Clean and inviting.  Even though I've only been once before, the owner remembered and welcomed me back; that's always nice!I had the beef bulgogi dog, and we also tried the beer battered fried pickles and classic fries.  Part of the fun of eating here is watching everyone try to fit their loaded dog into their mouth and all the toppings falling into a pile.  It's messy and finger licking good.  The beef bulgogi dog was excellent.  It had korean bulgogi style beef on top with green onions, sesame seeds and a zingy mayo.  Yum!  The fried pickles were probably the best version I've ever had.  The gave us a zesty east coast mayo for dipping.  The fries were crisp and seasoned and we got bloody mary ketchup and bbq ketchup to spruce them up.  They have loads of fun flavor of mayo and ketchup which you can sample for just 25 cents a piece.  The hot dogs themselves are excellent and you can build your own if you are apprehensive about international toppings.  They are plump and juicy and all beef goodness.  My dad had a traditional chicago style dog and loved it.  They also have favorites like a chilli cheese dog, corn dog and so on.  The prices are super reasonable.  I fed all three of us, with drinks, for $23.Try this place with for a delicious and creative twist on an old favorite.
