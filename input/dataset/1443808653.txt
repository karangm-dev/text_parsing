Goodfellas is extremely reliable, very efficient, and there's such sweethearts working there!! They treated me with an awesome service as well as great attitudes! I'm very pleased with the work they did on my 2016 Maserati!!!!! This place was fast and very friendly. I'm really surprised there's still amazing shops here in Las Vegas. . . I'd definitely bring my vehicle back here if I ever get hit again!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND GOODFELLAS TO EVERYONE NEEDING TO HAVE THEIR VEHICLES REPAIRED! EXCELLENT WORK!
