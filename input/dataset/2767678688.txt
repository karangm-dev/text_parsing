I just spoked with Paul Williams who response to my previous reviews because of the poor rating I gave. First, he sounded like he's concern about it and I don't know what he's after for but the conversations ended up ugly. I don't like the word he said "DONE" what is that mean? They tell their customers they give lifetime warranty with their jobs and now it sounded like only the paint job is guaranteed life time. This place is a bunch of "BS". Very poor customer service.. they don't even deserve a 1 star at all.
