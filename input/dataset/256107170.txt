Confession time: I occasionally have moments of gastronomic Tourette's syndrome, when I eat something so good I involuntarily start swearing.  I had such a food moment in Caf√© Bazin (apologies to those sitting at the counter next to me).  This is a small cafe near where I live, and I've walked past several times but never saw an open seat.  Tried my luck yesterday and there was an open spot at the counter.  I had the soup of the day, acorn squash, which triggered a few quiet f-bombs.  Amazing, rich, incredible depth of flavour.  Essence of squashiness.  Super happy fun time.  Also had the spinach quiche, which was almost as equally delicious.  Silky texture with wonderful crisp crust.  Portions are not large but the food is very rich so they are just right for lunch.  I was too full to try one of the beautiful desserts I saw on display but they looked amazing.  Service was slow, not in a bad way, but in a "this is a nice French cafe so sit there and savour your experience" kind of way.  Not a place to grab a quick bite but rather a place for a proper leisurely lunch. Prices are reasonable given the quality of the food.  Best lunch I've had in Montreal in a long time.  Can't wait to go back.
