Wasn't what we expected. Not our favorite of the trip. Was cool seeing it for the history factor. If I went again I would stick to a sandwich and maybe a dessert. Those looked good but not what we had. Nachos was kinda crappy and the chicken Alfredo was bland.  Awesome clean atmosphere though. Maybe what we ordered ?
