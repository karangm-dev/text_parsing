The chips and salsa were underwhelming. Chips - not made in house - were cold and flavorless. The salsa was ok but also lacked flavor and and was too small a portion. We ordered green burritos enchilada style. The tortillas were thick and tasteless  and the filling was lukewarm and also lacking. The plate was hot se we suspect they simply stuck it in the microwave.The only positives of our meal were the red enchilada sauce was tasty as was the margarita.
