Bad worst service, owners David and girlfriend Kayo only knows money, they are money hungry. They are very rude, my nail technician was Miley but it seems like she is no longer working there and yet they are lying saying she's on vacation or coming back. He contacted Yelp to remove my previous reviews and that I was implementing that I'm creating a conflict of interest. Which I'm not! Miley and Hannah are the only ones who are good at their shop but Miley is gone and Hannah is out for maternity leave. How is this criticism a conflict of interest?David, you practically a liar and you miss lead people, customers so you can get more more by setting up Miley's customers to have their nails done by your other technicians. Liar and this is bad for your business.
