Great!! The charred edamame and shishito peppers were great for starters. And the short rib steamed buns were out of this world! We had the Las Vegas Roll and warm root veggie salad which were great as well. They have great portions here and everything is reasonably priced. It's a very welcome addition and change from the horrible Xtreme Sushi.
