Booked a flight and their website glitched and as a result, I was unexpectedly charged.  When I called customer service, they did not hassle me or give me any issues.  They gave me a full refund within minutes, no questions asked.  I am honestly really impressed and surprised by their level of customer service compared to other airfare services I have used.
