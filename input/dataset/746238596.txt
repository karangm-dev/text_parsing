I cannot say enough about this place.  I live in Portland, Maine, small-town capitol of amazing restaurants, and I couldn't find a single fault here.I was pretty wary when we walked up to the restaurant--it doesn't look like much from the outside and the decor is definitely nothing to write home about.  It's a very small dining room with apparently only one waiter.  My boyfriend doesn't speak French so the waiter translated THE ENTIRE MENU for us!  (I probably could have done without the explanation of what ravioli is, but so kind nonetheless.)  He could not have been any more accommodating.We started with foie gras ravioli and brie--I was, frankly, shocked by the quality of the presentation.  The onion soup was the perfect size--a first-course snack with the clarity and simplicity of the best French food.I had the duck (not in a jar) with a beet reduction, roasted vegetables and popcorn.  Again, the plate was gorgeous and the duck was cooked perfectly.  He had the lamb and it fell off the bone--no knife necessary.  We finished with lime creme brulee--delicate flavor, perfectly bruleed top. Of course, bring your own wine!  The bill was 80 for basically four courses for each of us--extremely affordable.
