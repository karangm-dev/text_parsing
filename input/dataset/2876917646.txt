I thought it would be a wonderful idea to come to pistil because it seems like the go-to florist down at the finance district. However, it was a mistake.  I came to pistil with high expectations but was disappointed. The arrangement of flowers were wilted and dried, some buds were on the verge of snapping off, an orchid was literally taped to a stick...definitely not worth $60...
