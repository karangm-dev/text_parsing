This restaurant definitely lives up to the hype and if you asked me one restaurant you should go to in Vegas this would be it. I had heard of the restaurant before on my travels to Montreal, but never got around to it. Montreal for the record is a foodie wonderland. Although this restaurant is priced high, in Vegas terms I would say it's average. The service, ambiance and location are exceptional and the food couldn't be more perfect. I usually have some sort of critique on what could be better, and this time all I can say is that if they could make the meal never end. The best way to experience Milos is via their tasting menu. I started with their grilled octopus which is one of the best I've had (other than in Montreal of course). The flavor and texture of their octopus is just right and the portion perfect. For my main I went with the lobster pasta, which was equally delicious as my starter and equally well executed. If I could eat this dish every day, I would. Dessert was a baklava walnut cake topped with honey ice cream. Delicious and a perfect ending. I can see why this restaurant is considered one of the best Mediterranean ones in the world - with locations in London, Athens, New York, Miami, Las Vegas and Montreal.
