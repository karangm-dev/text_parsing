Food is good but service from the hostesses sucked! She seated all the 2s and 4s before us because we were 3 people. She said she didn't want to waste an empty spot. So we got to wait over an hour and she seated all other guests before us, even people just walking up. Ignorance at it's worst. And no apology or anything. If I was the owner, I'd be ashamed.
