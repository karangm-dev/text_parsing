Since this location is right down the street from our house, it's an easy choice. However since they redid their menu, very disappointed with each choice. Always a huge fan of the pretzel bites! Incredibly disappointed last night with the Golden Chicken tenders. We ordered the bucket of 16 for $26 since it was a better deal than the 4 Piece for $12. Way more crunchy bread than chicken. It hurt our teeth to eat more than 2 tenders each! When I flagged down the waitress to ask why they were so crunchy, she said she was new and would ask if it was a new recipe. And of course never came back until we flagged her down for the check.  We left incredibly disappointed and hungry. What a waste of $51! Could have gone to so many better restaurants for that price. Besides their pretzel bites, sad to say I doubt we will be coming back to this location soon, or recommending it anymore.
