I had a massage today with Madily.  The whole experience was wonderful!!!! The staff at the front desk were warm and helpful.  This was my first time with Madily and she was excellent.  I have a bad hip and she worked very hard to get out the surrounding knots while being considerate of my pain.  I'm also working hard at losing weight and slightly conscientious of my body but 5 min into the massage session she had me totally relaxed and comfortable.  She was professional and caring.  I would come back weekly if I wasn't moving out of town in 2 weeks!
