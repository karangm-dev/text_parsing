Very mediocre Chinese.  Wife ordered General Tsos which was ok.  I ordered the Shrimp Mei Fun which was fairly tasteless until I drowned it in Soy Sauce.  The crab Rangoon was just bad.  Filling tasted odd and some of them weren't closed properly and the filling was gone.  The delivery person was very nice and very prompt and the prices were reasonable at least.
