I went to this dentist in 2011. She did work on my teeth and charged my insurance. I also paid hundreds of dollars in deductible. She waited 4 years then called me and told me I owe 690.00 from a past bill. When I refused to pay her extortion she put it on my credit. I am still fighting this. She is shady and her work is terrible !!!!
