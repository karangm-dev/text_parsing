Did a BOGO for Samsung Galaxy S9 in April 2018. Arranged for in-store pick up. Got the phone, paid off my old one and closed a tablet line. All was good and my bill should of went down $10! Two months later my bill went up $60. Called Verizon, said it was stores mess up. Called Store they put me back on the call center. Got the call center to submit a form 3x to fix the promotion and was denied for various reasons, the final one being the account was past due because they charge me extra per month.  I have paid it all off AGAIN and filed a BBB complaint. I don't care if the call center or the store fixes it, It just needs to be done right. I have been a customer for over 10 years this is not a way to treat a long standing client.
