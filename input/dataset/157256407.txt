Had a delicious "blunch" here this weekend. We shared the pork croquette as first course. It was phenomenal!! Highly recommend it as an appetizer. We then had the chicken 'n' watermelon 'n' waffles. Tasty but the croquette really stood out more for us. The two of us couldn't finish it.We returned later for evening cocktails:-Yardbird Old Fashioned: WAY too sweet for us and the smoky flavor from the bacon overpowered the spirit a bit.-Porkchop: "An unthinkable mix of Duke bourbon, Yardbird dijon syrup, yuzu juice & apple cider. Served in a highball & paired with a 1 Â¼" block ice with a dijon thyme cube." When I ordered this, the server got a funny look on her face. "What?" I asked. She said that most people think it's interesting "if you like herbs." I started to change my order, but she insisted that I try it, saying I could trade it for something else if I didn't like it. IT WAS GREAT! A very refreshing drink that could perhaps be described as a cousin to a gin fizz.This was one of our favorite Vegas restaurants during this trip. We'll be back for sure.
