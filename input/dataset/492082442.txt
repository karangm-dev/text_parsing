Most Fun and Relaxing Surgery I have ever experienced!Table-side manner is very important when you could potentially experience pain and possibly pass out!  Dr. Lind and his Assistant had a great sense of Humor while being completely professional and were very careful to help me feel as comfortable as possible!This was a minor operation on the same toe that has undergone a similar surgery by a different Physician, many years ago before Jongeys walked the Earth.  When informing the staff here that the previous anesthetic did not work, they were confident that the drugs had improved over the years.  Hummmm... as I suspected the "new drugs" were indeed "better", though even after extra injections I could still feel some of the procedure (mostly only a few sharp pains that were only momentary) and minor discomfort compared to what I had experienced before!Dr. Lind and his Assistant made sure I understood my "at-home" post-surgical work to insure the best healing outcome!  The Receptionist was great too, very friendly and patient!
