Pizza is good if you get what you actually ordered. I just ordered a ham, pineapple, and jalapeno pizza, simple, right? Well first they gave me olives instead of jalapeños. I called them and they happily agreed to make a new pizza with jalapenos, so I drove back to get my new pizza. This time it came with jalapeños, but instead of pineapple it had pepperonis. So I basically just drove here twice to get two incorrect pizzas.
