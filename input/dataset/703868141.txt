I recently dined at Hyde Park Prime Steakhouse in Beachwood with a large group of friends and family members (20+). My in-laws reserved a private room which was so nice and spacious. It had a fireplace which made it feel cozy on a chilly fall November evening. There were a few kids in the group so it was nice to have our own room so as not to bother other patrons. I highly recommend keeping this in mind if you're planning a small gathering either personally or professionally. I would like to particularly thank Anthony, Clarence and Skylar (hopefully I got the spelling right) who waited on our party and did a fabulous job. They were extremely helpful, knowledgeable and patient with our group and happy to help make suggestions/recommendations on food and drink orders. There were several toasts made throughout the evening and they were always cognizant to close the double doors and to stop service while speeches were being made. My husband ordered a Filet Mignon and a side of Saut√©ed Asparagus, I ordered the Spicy Tuna Crunch Roll, both meals were delicious. Our entire group enjoyed the meals and merriment.  I have been to other steakhouses in the area including: Fleming's, Morton's, Red, Ruth's Chris Steak House, XO Seafood And Oysters but by far received the best service and hospitality at Hyde Park Prime Steakhouse in Beachwood. I look forward to returning again!
