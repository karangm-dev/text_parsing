If you are a guy and your sole reasons for going out to a wing place are:A. Hot waitresses in skimpy outfitsB. Loads of Plasmas all aroundThen this is the place for you...if you, like me, go for the FOOD, then stay away from this place! My husband and I have tryied different wing places and this place really dissappoints. The wings are not very tasty and some seemed either over-cooked and dry or just old. The service was ok but not enough to keep u coming back. I must say the best wings I ever had were at a wing place in North Bay..since the drive is REALLY far..the closest thing is: Memphis BBQ on Islington and Wild Wing.Too bad you couldnt live upto your name St. Louis!
