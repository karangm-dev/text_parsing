An Oasis in the sea pf BBQ post. Service was good. The food however was very good. The Super Incan Warrior was fantastic. The sweet potato sushi roll was tasty, not fired, and delightfully spicy. The BLT with mushrooms instead of bacon was thw star of the meal. (Extra bonus due to avocado being added) The only disappointment was the bland and almost tastless Waldorf Salad.  Highly recommend
