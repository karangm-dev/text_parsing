Having heard the "Two Hot Tamales" on the radio for some time, I was eager to give their restaurant a fair shake.  As we approached the restaurant, a neon sign hung underneath the Border Grill announcing "REAL MEXICAN FOOD."  Already, that's a bad sign...  Anyway, here's a recap.  The food is very good, but certainly not worth the outrageous prices that are on the menu.  My wife and I both had one drink, guacamole and a main dish for just under $100.  The meal portions are a little on the small side (for Mexican food), but just right for anything else.  The ingredients are fresh but both meals appeared to be hurried with very little attention to detail.  The dining area is a bit cramped and if you are unlucky enough to sit next to people with children, then you will no doubt listen to the world's most fascinating conversations.  In the end, would I go back?  Definitely not.  There are some real great Mexican restaurants off the strip in Las Vegas, if you have a  car, please make the drive.  For the price that we paid, we could have feed a family of 6 anywhere else.
