We were supposed to be on a flight from Rockford, IL. to Orlando, FL. It was supposed to depart at 9:39am. After a delay of an hour we were then informed there were some maintenance issues and they did not know how long it would be. The only updates we received were to inform us every 45 minutes that we were still waiting for maintenance to arrive. Finally 4 hours later they told us our flight was cancelled and going to be rescheduled for tomorrow. Never once in all this time did anyone even say sorry for the inconvenience. My son is devastated because we are now missing a day and a half of his first disney world trip. I will never fly this airline again.
