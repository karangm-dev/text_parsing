I have gone to streets many times and unfortunately their food is so incredibly inconsistent. When it's good, it's good (however overpriced), but I have never been so disappointed in my life with my last order and this is not the first time things have gone wrong. I spent almost $50 on dinner and did not like one thing. I got a buffalo chicken pizza and asked for no provolone only mottz. They gave me a pizza with only chicken no buffalo sauce or cheese on it. So basically I got bread with chicken. Then I got chicken parmesan . The sauce tasted like it was burnt and stuck to the bottom of the pot. It was disgusting. Worst sauce I have EVER had. Then I got the meatball appetizer which were then again ruined because of the burnt sauce all over it. And To top it off the food was cold by the time it got here so all the cheese was hardened to the containers. I will unfortunately not be a returning customer. My orders have been made wrong too many times.
