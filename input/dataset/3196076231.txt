I think it is helpful to know where someone is coming from, as a review from someone from a random midwest state (no name calling) who has never seen a Cirque show will have a very different opinion than someone from Las Vegas who has seen five. At least, they will have a very different reason for having the opinion that they have, even if the end result is the same: 5 stars!I have seen several of the traveling Cirque shows, and I have seen O. I think if you have never seen a Cirque show, then perhaps you should see O or Mystere or Ka, as they capture more of the circus elements which are the core of the traditional Cirque shows. However, if you are a big Beatles fan or a fan of dance and music and technology or you have already seen a Cirque show, head straight to LOVE. Like some other reviewers, I am not a Beatles fan. I can hum a tune, but I can't name every song off the White album. For the duration of LOVE, however, I was the biggest Beatles fan in the world. The sound is other worldly. The theater is astounding. The video elements are above par, especially when they actually incorporate real footage. The narrative is superb. The dancing is delightful, beautiful and entertaining. The show is a true inspiration for so many reasons.
