This spicy lemonade is everything you need and MORE!  The owner was super sweet and helpful. I had no idea what I was craving, she asked a few questions and immediately recommended this drink      It's so refreshing it hits the tastebuds JUST right. Don't let the name fool you, it has a very mild kick, so if you're not fond of spicy this is still a good option for you!
