Great service combined with great Italian food warrants my high rating. Multiple servers checked on us to make sure our needs and expectations were being met. Meals at our table included the Gnocchi, Veal Marsala and Gorgonzola Penne pasta. This was my second visit here and felt the experience worthy of a review.
