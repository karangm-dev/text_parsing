OMG used their garlic olive oil (which i just bought yesterday btw) in a homemade pasta dish-AHmazing! even my boyfriend commented how yummy the oil smelled when i opened the bottle. took dinner from tasty to fabulous! the store is great. all kinds of olive oils and vinegars, also sold pasta and sauces. the staff was very helpful and down-to-earth friendly. to top it off, they had a ton of samples and interesting suggestions for ways to use their products. what a great place, i will definitely be going back, most likely to buy their mushroom sage olive oil, which i scoped out yesterday. oh yeah, and very reasonable prices as well, $14 a bottle, 100% worth it! attractive packaging, i walked out with a cute little brown bag with green tissue paper, great gift idea for my mom i was thinking. AND they informed me at checkout that they have a loyalty program, get 10 stamps on your card get a bottle free or something along those lines. cant wait to get my card stamped again haha!
