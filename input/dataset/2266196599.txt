Not sure what the hype is about, at least for dinner. Ordered the fish n' chips...they ran out of fish. Ordered the avocado toast....for $8.00, got avocado that was browning already. The salad with chicken was a monstrosity. Veggies of a rather low quality overall. Classic burger was pedestrian. In short, there doesn't seem to be anything to distinguish this diner from any other in Vegas and it's no better (possibly worse) than a Denny's. Would try again for breakfast...maybe.
