This place is awesome!!  30 minutes till closing and there were still accepting Patrons to sit and have dinner!!  Most businesses would've stop taking incoming patrons before their closing time...high five!!  Then, I was WOWed at how fast they took our orders and brought the food to the table!  And, the portions are pretty good for the price too.  You must check this place out guys!!!
