There is nothing remotely interesting at Deemo's.  An obviously premade frozen hamburger, fries of the sort I can buy at Safeway, and prices that are higher than any one of my beloved restaurants where it's all fresh?  No thanks.I ate lunch here today, as it's in my office complex.  The place itself is actually pretty cute and seems like it would be fun to grab a few beers after work, which is why I gave it the two stars.  But every other restaurant in the complex would have to close down before I'd pay $10 for anything on Deemo's menu again.
