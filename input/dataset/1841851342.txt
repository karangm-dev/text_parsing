Worst car dealership that I have ever dealt with. After leasing my vehicle over a month ago, I still haven't received my license plates and now my temp plates have expired. When I called the dealership, they shamelessly refused to cover any travel expenses, even though it was their major mistake that I now can't drive my own vehicle. Everyone I dealt with, from the salesperson Mike Redmond, to Mike Fabian in finance, to Steve the sales manager, participated in the dealership's overall incompetence and were unwilling to help. Stay away!
