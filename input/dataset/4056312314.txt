Took my daughter to celebrate her passing the second block of nursing school with our entire family, the service was out of this world. The owner came over to introduce &'congratulate her, few minutes later comes to hand her a baskets of their famous garlic knots as a token of grangratulaions! Then, he brought us all sampler of their dessert balls after we finished our meal. Just amazing service overall. Now, as far as the food...it totally matched the 5-star service we received. We ordered the Alfredo, wow, never in my life have we had alfredo taste that delious! We also order three x-large pizza pies...best way to eat these bad boys is right out of the oven...unbelievable experience and taste!!!!
