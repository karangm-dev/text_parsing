While ice cream might be delicious, service was horrendous. We tried ordering "Child Creations" in a waffle bowl (for kids 12 and under), and the girl kept on saying "but it's a tiny scoop of ice cream...it's just a tiny scoop of ice cream...."  As parents we are aware of kids portions. sizing, but the way she was demanding us to get a bigger size was very condescending.
