Went to Steiner's last week and had a blast!  Great service, prices and it was nice to be in a pub that had a lot of friendly people.  I used to frequent 'that other bar down the street' but their service has gone to he**.  Steiners is my new local pub (especially since I live just down the street.)  Keep up the good service!Kris
