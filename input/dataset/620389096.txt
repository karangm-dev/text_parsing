If I could give this place zero stars, I would. The outside seating is beautiful, but polluted with cigarette smoke everytime I come here, and the service is sub par. My friend ordered a drink and didn't like it, and the barista made no efforts to correct it for her and said that she needed to reorder it. This is the first coffeeshop I have ever seen where they don't satisfy a customer's wishes and leaves them empty handed with a four dollar drink they don't like. Also, it is required to purchase a drink for wi-fi as a heads up if you were planning on coming and working.
