Why would this facility host a tournament event for over 30 teams and over 200 people with the ac off?! It's 112 degrees in there! I asked the employees why the air is off and they claim it's not, they turned it on at 7am. It's 2pm and over 100 in this faculty with a full gym of boys playing basketball, this is not safe! At $10 a head to get in and tournament fees, you should be able to prepare better and cool your facilities. Absolutely ridiculous!
