I had seen the four starts from my fellow Yelpers and decided to take my wife for dinner the other night.  I had big hopes, especially since it was walking distance from my home.We were disappointed.  Yes, 'Meh, i've experienced better.' is a good way to put it.  We were served oil soaked eggroll skins as a snack - awlfu.  We ordered cocktals that were hevily advertised to then see the waitress reading in a book how to make them.  They were weak and uninspired.We ordered a special seafood hot pot. Which was ok, but too filled with tofu.We ordered a Peking pork, which was served with mu shu pancakes and hosin sauce and a whole bunch of celery.  I mean a ton of celery.  Cheap filler?  We ordered brown rice and fried rice as sides.  When they arrived we could not distinguish one from the other.  We even asked her to confirm, thinking she made a mistake.  No, she confirmed it.  The fried rice had no other veggies or bits of meat or even a browned color.Sure, i will give it another try, but I have a few more places to try first.Also note - as of our visit on 9/30/13, they no longer have any happy hour specials or offers.
