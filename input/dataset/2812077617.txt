Definitely worth parking here, especially if you're traveling over any period of time in Cleveland that involves snow fall (November to like April).  Get in on their member rewards, and they'll send you a card that you can insert and use instead of taking a ticket every time you park.  You can build up free parking with your stays.  If you work for UH, sign up through UH's group rates and it saves you a little bit of money to boot (especially if you stay for an extended period of time).  Perk is that they have complimentary water as your leaving and I won't have to worry about scrapping my car when I come back from a winter trip
