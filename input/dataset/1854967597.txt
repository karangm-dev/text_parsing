I called this place because a former neighbor recommended them. I called late afternoon in a panic when my hot water heater stopped working. Of course I had family flying in the next afternoon making the matter more inconvenient! Someone was able to come the very next morning to check out and fix the problem. He was knowledgeable, courteous, efficient, and was able to fix the heater before my family arrived. I would definitely recommend this company to others.
