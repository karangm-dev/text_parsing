I will never go back, first of all my insurance was suppose to cover most of the exam but it ended up costing me $165. A very young girl did all the testing, I saw a Dr. for a brief 5 minutes and she wrote a prescription for contacts that I can't even see out of. I also had an eye condition that she told me to go to Walgreens for an over the counter eye drops which didn't do a thing. I ended up going to urgent care and then an opthamogist. I am returning to my previous Dr. this next appointment even though he doesn't accept my insurance. I just want to be able to see. What a joke, I can't believe Pearle Bision stays in business. Very very unprofessional.
