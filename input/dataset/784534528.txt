Darlene was great to work with! I ordered the most lovely wedding cake with tropical flowers for my tiki themed wedding. She worked within my budget, was lovely to speak with over the phone, and delivered my cake on time and in one piece. It was beautiful and so delicious!!! I only regret I didn't get more than one piece!!!
