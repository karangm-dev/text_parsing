Well I called in and made a same day appointment and came in, they said I would be out of here in a little over an hour. It's now been over an hour and a half and they haven't even touched the car. When I asked why so many people who showed up after me had been helped and left the kid at the counter went to look at the screen and the car had obviously been skipped. What's extra crappy is he said my car was next and I have seen at least three other cars go in in front of mine. Now I can't say for sure that they are bigots but I was wearing my gay pride hat and some of the employees gave me weird looks....... but once again kinda weird that all the hillbilly trash that came in here got moved ahead of me as I sit here waiting...... avoid this place and all discount tires.
