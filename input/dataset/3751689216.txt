Towed and ticketed for parking 1 inch into an unused driveway of a closed industrial area! We were horrified to find our car missing after leaving the fair at 9:45 pm on Wed night. We parked at 7:30 pm on Willetta between 18th and 19th Ave. There are two commercial driveways that are hard to see. Apparently this is an area that police ticket and tow vehicles frequently. No signs indicate no parking or where you will be towed. We were lucky that someone on a bike told us the Phoenix police have up to 60 vehicles towed a night for the most minor parking violations and showed us the impound area which is on Grand Ave under the I-10 overpass. You are forced to pay $104 to the city for an administration fee plus $25 to the tow truck company plus another $70 to the city for the parking violation. Yikes, so much for saving on $2 ride night! This is a huge money maker for the city, please beware. Too bad that signs are not posted to warn fair attendees of this highly monitored parking patrol.
