This place is ridiculous. I was given a referral to this place for my son. They called on a Thursday; I missed the call but immediately returned it and was told they aren't accepting calls by the receptionist and to call back on Tuesday. (Why call someone not leave a message then say your not answering calls) I let her know I just received a call and wanted to schedule an appointment for my son and she repeats whoever called me doesn't accept incoming calls and how I could imagine how "fun" that's making her job telling people to just call back. (Already unprofessional venting to a customer). Fast forward I call back today Tuesday during the time I was told and now I'm told the scheduler isn't there so they won't be scheduling anything till Thursday. Why would I be told to call back today? How difficult is it to schedule a appointment that you have to have only 1 part time person to do It? Are your receptionist to incompetent to schedule an appointment? Then she makes it seem like they have SOOOO MANY new referrals a week as if my referral is less important because they have other clients. Which is fine because they definitely won't EVER have my business.Edit: One of the owners has messaged me to remedy the situation which is fine but I've already found a different place.
