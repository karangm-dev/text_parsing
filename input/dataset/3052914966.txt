Terrible!I got a gel manicure that lasted 3 days before it started to lift from the edges of the nail. I ended up removing them, they came off in one piece! Like it was rubber.I paid $40 for gel (including an extra $10 for matte). What a disaster. The girl didn't even know how to make matte tips, she asked for help and the one other girl who didn't even listen to the problem just painted all my nails matte (as fast as she could) so then more top coating had to be added, the result of it was a bubbly tip on each nail. I wish I had pictures to show!Honestly, I would have been happy to have given the $40 (plus tip) to a homeless person than this place (with horrible customer service, I must add).I'm just going to end this here before I get myself in trouble.
