We came in after a flight into Las Vegas. The server spent a ton of energy trying to get us to fill out an online survey about her. She even went as far as to tell us what to write. It was an awkward moment  when she asked us if we had completed it yet to get our $5 off. The food was ok, nothing to write home about. I would say more about the food then the staff. The meal was spoiled by the regular survey questions from our server.
