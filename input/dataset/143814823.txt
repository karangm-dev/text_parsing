This is the best place only to have a relaxed Sunday brunch in Pittsburgh. If you can locate this place in Southside it takes even more searching to find someone to seat you in the backside if the antique store. The wait is worth it even for non-vegetarians as they choose from a range of entrees that keep changing every week. Additionally feel free to help yourself to numerous salads, rice and noodle dishes with bread and dips on buffet. The dessert options are pretty good if you have room left in your stomach. Their spl teas are good and deserve refills.All this for $10 leaves you with lot more to spend on the rest of your Sunday.
