What can i say? The staff was amazing, the food was amazing... Everything was perfect. My new husband and i stopped in while on our honeymoon. Neither off us had ever tried indian food. The server made excellent suggestions and worked to make the night very special once he learned that we were newlyweds. Next time we are in vegas we will make sure to Stop in
