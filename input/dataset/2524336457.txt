Tried this for summerlicious. Complimentary bread was nice.My entree was the chicken, and found it very bland. My friend had the pizza and enjoyed it a lot more.Appetizer and dessert were good, just disappointed by the chicken.Staff is friendly and attentive. Food came out fairly quickly, dessert took forever.
