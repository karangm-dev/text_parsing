We had dinner here the final night of our vacation and it didn't disappoint.We  tried the Prix Fixe menu with wine pairings and everything was delicious!The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly, the mash potatoes and asparaguswere spot on, and the dessert trio was the pefect ending to a wonderful meal.Dewy was our waiter and his service was top notch and superb!  Our water glasseswere never empty and he took the time to explain each wine pairing which was soenjoyable.  Overall it was a wonderful experience and I would highly recommend thisrestaurant to anyone who wants to experience a great steak dinner on the strip.
