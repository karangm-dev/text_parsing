Tried this restaurant for the first time today.Our salad was the highlight of the mealWe ordered the Regina Margarita pizza and added mushrooms and pepperoni. The pizza had tomato sauce. 6 pieces of mozzarella,2 pieces of basil,4 pieces of pepperoni and about 6 pieces of mushrooms we would have been better off ordering naked pizza with just sauceWe also ordered zepola which was cooked in the same oil as the calamari and tasted like itLastly we got the cannoli which was subpar I hope they were just having an off night but I will think twice be
