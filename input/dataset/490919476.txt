I just recently purchased my home and one of the bathroom toilet was having an issue,it seem to clog after each use. I ignored it long enough because I was always able to fix it with the plunger. Well tonight the plunger wouldn't work and Andy toilet was overflowing. I called Terry up and he came over within ten minutes, keep in mind this happened on a Friday night! He was quick, professional, and well priced. He snaked the toilet and replaced a clogged valve. I would definitely recommend Terry and Rooter 4 Less for any one that has a plumbing issue, big or small.
