It was hard to decide one star or two. The food tasted good....the waitresses lack of knowledge & lack of social skills is why I won't come back. I was excited to eat here. I have Celiac, so it's hard to eat out! I asked our waitress about what I could have....she admitted she didn't know much about GF, but they had gluten free buns. And any of the burgers could be made gluten free. So I kinda thought she would ask if any apps. or something else was gluten free, but she didn't care enough to ask. So I went with a burger & zuchinni fries. The food tasted good. But when I got a closer look at my bun, it was charred black. Now the waitress said ahead of time....it will be toasted. So when I politely said "uh it's not a big deal, but this is really burnt bad. For $2 extra for the bun that's not right." So she got pissed off & said "I told you it would be toasted" then walked away. I didn't want to cause a scene, I had my kid with me.....but I know what toasted is & this was closer to hockey puck. Her attitude was worse than the bun. If they are an allergy friendly place, then she should also be more informed or what people can or can't have. I did get my $2 back.....she said something pissy to me I didn't quite catch & tossed the check towards me. Like an idiot I left a decent tip. My mistake!
