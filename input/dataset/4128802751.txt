We celebrated my 70th birthday at Michaels. The food was very expensive, which I knew going in. The food, however,  fell far short of the price. . The ma√Ætre d was accommodating. The wait staff was attentive. Above average ambiance. The experience soon deteriorated when the food started to arrive. The standard relish tray and bread (what imagination). Escargot served with a soggy pastry topping (truly uninspiring). Rack of lamb for two $175 served on two platters each with a huge stuffed tomato Two "big chunks" of cauliflower and broccoli together with a bowl of vegetables ("me hungry"). A feast fit for a lumberjack, but not fine dining. Quantity must equal quality at Michaels.I ordered a side of creamed spinach that was milky and slimy (the only word I can use to describe it). To finish, some chocolate covered fruit accompanied by a big  a bowl of fruit. I'm full once again just remembering. This review is harsh but accurate. I love the South Point but Michaels  need not worry about another bad review from me.
