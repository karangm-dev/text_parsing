One star for their flameless candles in ceramic jars. Bought 6 in last 2 months 4 have failed. Very disappointed. Back to Amazon.  Update. Don't know how the Sam's Club on South Eastern survives. Was in the other day because I happen to be in the neighborhood. Store was almost empty. Did check on a few things there sparkling flavored water verses Costco. $14 at Sams $8.99 at Costco. Noticed other items at significant price difference.
