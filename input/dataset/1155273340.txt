Loud ... chaotic ... did I mention loud ...There were as many people behind the counter as in the dining room and outdoor patio.Very industrial decor ... not much in way of sound barriers ... not a place for a lunch meeting.I had the shrimp avocado black bean corn salad.  Everything was chopped .... it was ok ... mixed greens would have elevated the meal.The potato soup was watery......Trying to eat healthier (w/o doing the chopping),  I have visited this restaurant multiple times recently for takeout. I have been very pleased with the variety of options (ex. Citrus lime vinegarette).   It is running like a well oiled machine.The noise level hasn't changed.
