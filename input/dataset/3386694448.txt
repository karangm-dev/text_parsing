My boyfriend had just gone here to purchase for his mom for Mother's Day.  He tells me as he was in there that NO EMPLOYEE WANTED TO HELP HIM! He had told me there was group of bihs just standing there all talking and as my boyfriend would pass nobody even bother to help. He said they would just stare at him as if he was stealing. One of the employees had went in the area he was in and didn't even bother to help him either. Finally they had called a male employee to go help him and my boyfriend even said that the guy gave him a look like as if he didn't want to help him...after he had showed him what he was trying to find the male employee immediately left. When my boyfriend was paying the cashier person had the nerve to check all his bills as if they were all fake. I understand you could check bills but she had done all...First off, my boyfriend had never been in ulta so he doesn't know where anything is at!Second, why is there a group of employees not helping??!? How unprofessional. That is simply there job there. TO HELP SO DO IT! I can't believe none of this bihs could help! Also to treat him as if he was stealing and acting like they're better. How ignorant and discriminating of them. Just because he's a guy in a makeup store. Y'all need to do something about these rude employees who don't help. All I see is bad reviews so that says a lot about the people you're hiring. If I could I would rate zero.
