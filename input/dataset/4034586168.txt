For several weeks I tried to start a full corporate membership here and the staff there could give a darn. I'd use other words but they are not rated p.g. Never in my life in the service industry have I seen a business held to such low standards. I called several times and left my information and NEVER did I have one call returned. The customers here are treated like a nuisance and don't get me started how the front desk/salesman completely lie to you when signing agreements. I'd rate zero stars but they don't let you. Thank the Lord Snap fitness is right across the street.
