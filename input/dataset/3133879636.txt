Had my first visit and Vic is the best. The line was 10 deep at 11:15am and he charmed the crown as we patiently waited for the best chili dog I have ever had. The Boogie Down Dog was so good I wasn't sure that Southern all the way would even come close. Both were outstanding. I will definitely be a repeat customer.
