The food was good but the male staffs working there was very unprofessional...where they were grinning at us throughout our dining.  No smiles but giving that bad attitudes while picking up the used plates and even picking the utensils that we were working on still...  looked as if they wanted us to leave promptly...  I have a second thought of coming back here now...even, after our normal stays at the Signatures...hmmmm.  Need to working on customer service a bit...when comparing to other buffet restaurants that we visited.
