Been on a mission following triple D locations and was excited to make it here. Was such a big disappointment. Waited 15 minutes for the table, ordered, got drinks then our salads and food all came out together, on salad was wrong and was immediately replaced leaving me to believe there was no reason we couldn't have gotten our salads first. After that our server was gone, no checking on us, no drink refills, nothing! The food. Ceasar salad was bland and watery, croutons were good. Table split the rib plate. Daughter wouldn't eat the mac and cheese, it was thick and pasty. I was not a fan. Cornbread was DRY and had melted cheese on top? Ew. My portion of the ribs were good, the other two pieces were drrrryyyyyyy, the bark making it hard to chew and swallow. Bbq sauce is spicy and good. I wouldn't come back. Small menu, no kids menu and high prices for flashy food. Sorry guy, I still love you, just not your vegas kitchen.
