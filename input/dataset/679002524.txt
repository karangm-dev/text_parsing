Sometimes there's something so simple that causes you so much grief that it clouds your overall impression of a restaurant. Having a seat on a very small patio during the "OpenTheSteet" festival where Bloor was blocked off, on a beautiful day set the perfect stage for a great breakfast.Receiving a so-so Healthy Fat breakfast with 2 poached eggs, 2 pieces of avocado,some salmon and old mushy tomatoes, took down the experience a notch and receiving your breakfast with 2 plastic containers of butter and one of honey sitting right on the food takes the review way down. I don't understand how restaurants think it is acceptable to place those plastic packets, (that have been handled through shipping and distribution and exposed to who knows what kind of bacteria) right on top of the food! Is it really too much trouble just to bring them on the side?The meal itself wasn't great. The best part was the two slices of multi-grain toast. The poached eggs were so soft they looked like they glanced at some hot water. The smoked salmon was okay however the tomato slices, which I would have liked to have eaten with the salmon seemed to be garnish for the dish. Overall, at $14.95, this was not good experience.Service was okay, albeit a bit "clinical". I walked inside to go to the bathroom and can't say I saw very many happy faces...you the kind faces saying, "where's my meal", "I can't get any service", and "the food is not that great". Just an observation on my part.If you want to have a nice breakfast either on a great patio or even inside, L'Espresso Bar Mercurio just down the street is a much better place and the prices are nearly the same.
