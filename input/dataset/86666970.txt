Used to love Gallo Blanco and go there for lunch/dinner/happy hour! Sad to say the replacement restaurant is not that exciting..I went there for lunch with two friend of mine. We shared the Elote dip appetizer (Meh..not so much of a dip). We got complimentary sauces to try, and the creamy avocado was awesome! My friend ordered the chopped salad (was real good), and  we each ordered the chicken taco. All tacos came on one big plate. The chicken taco was moist but bland..I got the pork belly taco (very over-cooked (some pieces were hard to chew crispy and not in a good way!) and lacked seasoning. My friend got a shrimp taco and there was only one sad little shrimp on her taco, it was also kind of meh..This was a pretty disappointing lunch..used to be a great location and we had great expectations out of the chef/restaurant combo!
