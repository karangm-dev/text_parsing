PROS: I love this lee's location! it's my favorite to go to since it's near my home. it has everything you would want, they even have a growing sake collection!! they restock a lot. the staff is really helpful, I'm always asking them questions and they are nice and pretty knowledgable. there are always good prices CONS: sort of back alley, private area. it's a little cluttered and heavily stacked inside!OVERALL: by going here, you have the ability to make any outing into a good time ;)
