Been here a few times, the service is super slow just to order a coffee. Coffee prices are not cheap. Ive had the sandwiches which are pretty good but heavy. Most people come here to use the free wifi and they sit for hours drinking water. Not my favourite place and the inside could be fixed up a little more.
