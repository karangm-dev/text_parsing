This place is the best. My friends and I get takeout from here all the time, and it's great because I can exercise my total indecision right up to choosing food, because they have sooooooo many choices. Thai? Vietnamese? Chinese? Sushi? Tottie's has it all, and it is ALL delicious. Sugar Cane Chicken? Pho? Pad Thai? What are you in the mood for!? The prices are pretty reasonable and the portions are decent, not overwhelming, but everything is flavorful and distinctive.
