When the technician finally arrived he jacked the price up from $35 to $189, saying it depends on the lock.  This lock was in a door handle, and it took him 5 minutes to pick it.This company goes by several names.  The ones I caught were Coyote Lock and Key and Speedy Lock.  I needed them  to open a lock located in the handle of a residential door.  I was quoted $35 plus $19 for the house call.  I agreed and asked them to come in 2 hours since I was leaving for a meeting.  She said to be sure and leave my phone on as the technician would be calling when he was on his way.   They mistakenly sent two technicians on the same job and it took 8 calls to straighten it all out (so much for my meeting).The technician didn't arrive when scheduled and that took a couple more calls.  By this time they were beginning to speak politely to me.  Prior to this I was yelled at a couple of times.The technician wanted to charge me $189 plus $19 for the house call.  I told him I'd break a window before I would pay that kind of money.  We finally agreed on a price of $41 plus $19 for the house call.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS LOCKSMITH.BTW apparently they are nationwide and scam people everywhere
