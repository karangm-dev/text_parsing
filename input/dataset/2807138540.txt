A FEW ITEMS HERE I HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE(Warning: young adults from Central Florida in for vacation) There's plenty of variety available but the most interesting were all the cuts of meat such as prime rib. Of course there's sushi too but there were bowls of self-serve salmon or tuna poke as well- I haven't seen that before. Crab legs were a big draw as well as other unusual items like their ceviche and fish stew. The desserts are impressive with their own big section and are displayed impressively in mini, delicate servings.BUT IS IT WORTH THE PRICE, LINE, AND TIME?Oh no. No no no. First, the entrance line was at least 100 people deep for a weeknight dinner. Thankfully we reserved spaces ahead of time and skipped that line. Then, at $50/head it's much cheaper to enjoy a better tasting/ better quality meal off the strip (and that's including Uber).HOW WAS THE FOOD ITSELF?I had a few bites of almost every offering there. It was difficult to enjoy the crab legs (obviously the main draw) since each leg was cut lengthwise resulting in thin, scraggly meat. The sushi rice was a bit hard from being left out. Other seafood tasted old. At least our servers were quick to clean, refill drinks, and were polite.
