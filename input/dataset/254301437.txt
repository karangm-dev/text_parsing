So i decided I wanted to try something new for lunch and was over near La Parilla Suiza figured would give it a shot, bad idea. First of the server completely misleads me intentionally from ordering a $6 apetizer to a $16 meal by asking me if I want mushrooms with all nonchalantly like it was optional ti have with an appetizer, little did I know that now allowed him to charge me for a dinner on their menu how lovely. Then the appetizer was not even what he told me it was or description said it was which was supposed be queso dip instead was just like a huge gob of melted cheese with mushrooms of course obviously unappetizing. Whrn i got the bill and asked him why the $16.99 dinner he told that ai said that was what I wanted I explained that he nonchalantly told me that it came with if I wanted to which he nor the manager cared at all about. So I only gave him a 10% which is very low by my standards. As i am leaving I see him picked it up and call me an ahole. Two points to the story #1 La Parilla Suiza blows don't go there and #2 stick with what you know shoulda went to Valle Luna
