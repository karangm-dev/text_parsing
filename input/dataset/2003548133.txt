I just recently started shopping at this company.  Still trying to evaluate how the clothing will work out at this point.  However, the encounters I have had with their employees have not been pleasant.  I feel the definitely need improvements in customer service.  There seems to be a lot of flawed logic in their company policies.  At least the interpretation of them by employees.  Will likely avoid this store.  Not sure how online service is though.
