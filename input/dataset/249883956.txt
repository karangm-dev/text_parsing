I was absolutely upset with my experience today. I went for an appointment at the chandler location, and saw Dr. Le. First, the lady on the phone to set up the appointment was snippy and was assuming I knew things (that I didn't know off hand; like when my last appointment was or who I saw) and seemed irritated when I said I couldn't remember. Don't they have records for that reason?? Dr. Le was hard to understand and didn't seem helpful at all. I was intimidated and didn't get answers for what I needed because I was just fed up. He seemed like he just wanted to get me in and out without really taking time to be a doctor. I have had pleasant experiences at this location- but I needed to try dr. Le because I needed the first available appointment. I will be going back because of past experiences, but definitively not for Dr. Le. The two star is for their reputation that they hold with me, but it went down because of today.
