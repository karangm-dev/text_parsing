I had 10 windows installed in 2007.  They are inexpensive, professional,   and the windows came with a lifetime warranty.Boy, shopping for windows was an education back then--I actually had one company (whos name I cannot remember-dang it!) send out a rep that was high on drugs.  So when I met the people from Window World,  I was so excited to be dealing with professionals!The ordering process was so easy I was actually a little bit worried.When they told me about the warranty, I was skeptical.Anyhoo,It is now just a bit shy of  5 years later, and one of my windows broke.**insert sad face here**They are so nice!  They are so efficient!  They ordered my window, showed up when they said they would, and I have a brand new window!Need windows??  Call them!Recommend??  HECK YES!
