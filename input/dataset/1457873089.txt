I still have nothing from Natalie Pyles, Personal Trainer.  Also works out of Fitness Elements.  Amazingly, I have run into more people at my gym who have had the same scamming experience with her.  Her Facebook page is just as ridiculous as she is.  I am currently talking to an attorney about this to see what my options are.  A group of us are getting together to present something.  It is May, 2017, and still not one cent.  Check her out on Facebook, and you will see what I mean.
