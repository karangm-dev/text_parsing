It's so disappointing every single time I try and eat here, because I legitimately like the food. However, a restaurant like this shouldn't require reservations, but in order to get your food in a timely manner that's almost what it needs.I'm not too sure what the issue is because I've seen busier restaurants and I've never had to wait so long! I've complained before regarding the long wait and they told me if I want to be able to get my food in a timely manner, then I should call my food in ahead of time. Well I've tried THREE TIMES! On one occasion they put me on hold for ten minutes, which I wasn't upset about. Then someone picked up the phone and said "oh someone's on a call" and they were scrounging around to find out who's on call with me until the finally said hello AND ended up hanging up on me. Second time I tried calling, they said they couldn't hear me and hung up on me and when I tried calling back, it was busy for 30 minutes. Third time (which is the last time I tried calling) no one ever picked up. Either I was getting hung up on MULTIPLE times or they were ignoring my calls, which I tried calling from didn't numbers thinking it might have been my service.At some point the poor service starts to outweigh the food. I will honestly never come here again.
