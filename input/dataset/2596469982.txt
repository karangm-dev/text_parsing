Sunday brunch review:No king crab legs...this was a big disappointment for us since we were ALL looking forward to this.  But they had eggs benedict, delish smoked salmon and scallop ceviche.  Shrimp cocktail was okay.  Pancakes are made fresh hazelnut french toast which looked really good, there is also a custom omelet stand.  I didn't eat any bread product (other than bread pudding which was yum) or rice bc I wanted to eat the out of ordinary stuff lolPrime rib was tender and juicy.  Drinks were included other than bottomless mimosas and they have sparkling water!!!  Service was great.Strangely enough (because it's not an unusual item), I keep thinking about the sugar free cheesecake.Do not get sorbets, super melty and peach sorbet tasted like puke.  Get the raspberry kind if you must.
