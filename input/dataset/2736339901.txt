Came in at around 520 am, no wait in line. Counter help said i would be helped shortly. Watched as the workers talked, worked around eachother making jokes and while the cashier filled a couple dozen count donut boxes. Well 8 minutes later, i was apologized to and said it would be a longer wait. I didnt realize this was a sit down restaurant, i come in for a cup of coffee not to look at incompetence struggle to grasp customer service. Joke of a store, i would be emberassed to own or manage it. Grabbed coffee across the street at mcdonalds.
