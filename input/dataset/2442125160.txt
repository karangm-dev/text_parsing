Avoid.  Lost a pair of my pants and didn't even apologize.  Up to then, seemed nice enough, but as soon as they knew they lost my pants they literally could not get me out of their store as soon as possible.  They offered to compensate me $40 for a $400 pair of pants and shrugged as if to say "too bad".  They're cheap...don't do nearly as good of a job as the "Master Cleaners" around the corner on 8th St. and provide a level of service comparable to the government when prompted with a problem.  If you decide to you them, please be careful with what you send them.
