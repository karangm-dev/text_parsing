32 Shea CATERING: I used 32 Shea to cater an outstanding Breakfast Burrito brunch  for Nurse's week for approximately 45 staff members.  The famous New Mexico Burritos got rave reviews and disappeared in a flash. 32 Shea is locally owned and operated and the owner was so accommodating and efficient that she came in extra early to assemble our order and had it available on time and even earlier than the 6:30 AM pick up requested. The house made  Green Salsa had just enough kick to complement the delicious bite size  egg, potato, cheese, avocado and bacon (optional) burrito platter. They also provided me with their exceptional Coffee- to- Go in a large ready to pour travel container. Next time I will add the outstanding Nutella Mocha Coffee, my personal fav.  32 Shea is a little oasis in the middle of a shopping center with easy parking and access, a lovely patio, and a drive through for those on the go. The owner and staff of 32 Shea are flexible, efficient, exhibit a total "can do" attitude, and radiate positivity. The quality of the food and the service cannot be beat for local, fresh, and delicious. They aim to please. I would not hesitate to use them again for all my catering needs for brunches, lunches, or meetings.
