This place is fantastic. I moved from Tucson a few months ago and spent some time looking at different (and affordable) vets.  This is the first place I took my dog (April) to and the staff is wonderful, helpful and attentive.  April (who is 10 yrs old) got her teeth cleaned by Dr. Svoboda and naturally I was extremely nervous dropping her off (because of her age and she has valley fever) so the vet tech had the Dr come to the room beforehand and walk me through the whole procedure. She came out of it better than ever!!  Also, during her first exam he didn't try to do a bunch of unnecessary tests with outrageous prices, which is another HUGE reason why I am making this her permanent vet!
