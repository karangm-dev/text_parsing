Served is a real Henderson gem.I've been here twice now and both visits have featured food that was fabulous.  Both times I had the Ono Wings with rice because that dish is just delicious.  I am not really a wing woman, but I just love the seasoning they use, maybe soy?  I recommend this dish for yourself or to share if you're feeling generous.  My second visit was with the boyfriend for breakfast and I had the Longsilog (Filipino) breakfast, which was just like eating at my parents' house.  This dish features longanisa, garlic fried rice, and fried eggs, all of which are  regular features in Filipino households, or at least they are in ours, my aunts' and uncles', and cousins' kitchens.  Longanisa is a Filipino sausage that's on the sweeter side and is usually eaten with rice. Heck, most Filipino food is eaten with rice.  Although Served is not a Filipino restaurant per se, there is definitely a Filipino influence due to one of the chefs being married to a Filipina: he's a smart man.  I really loved this breakfast and of course I'm probably biased since it just brought back all the warm memories of home and Mom and Lola's cooking.  The staff here is very welcoming and attentive and the overall experiences I've had here just make me want to return again and again.  Next on my list to try are the longanisa tacos, the Mac and Cheese of the Day, and the Miso Pork Belly Burger.
