The service here always sucks and the food is mediocre. Waited 10 minutes in the bar area without being greeted so we asked for a table, where we waited another 15 minutes before the hostess finally took our drink order. The appetizer came out a little burnt, with the wrong dipping sauce, and the wings came out at room temp. It was two hours before close and the waitress had about 3 other tables. She was very apologetic about the wait, but there is simply no good reason to leave a party of two waiting 25 minutes for water. We live in the desert. Next time I'll go to Hooters across the street.
