Wow, what a great little gem. As a celiac this place is such an amazing find. It is 100% GF. I had the biscuits and gravy with potatoes and bacon. It came with a decent portion size which left me with leftovers. My mom had the pancakes with their homemade honey butter syrup. My sister who is not a celiac got the Nashville hot chicken and she said it was amazing. I highly recommend!
