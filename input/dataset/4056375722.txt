I've been coming here for a little over a year now. Great service and friendly staff. The salon is run by Julie and her sister, Tammy, who are both extremely kind and accommodating. They're always willing to squeeze you in, and  even if they're very busy, the wait is never longer than five or ten minutes. Lots of polish colors to choose from (gel and regular). So happy I found this salon and will be coming back for sure!
