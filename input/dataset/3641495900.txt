Your candles are getting CHEAP In quality!  Most of them only burn down half way until the wicks are useless.  I have had to throw away so many that never burned down. The fragrance is also weak .... used to have great quality candles years ago but not anymore.   Glade makes better candles and actually burn completely and have a noticeable fragrance.
