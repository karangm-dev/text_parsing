This is the first review I've ever written on Yelp, but I felt I owed this to fellow consumers of Discount Tire.  I went in this morning to get my tires rotated.  They said I needed new tires.  They quoted me a price on a middle two star tire.  I told them I would like to price compare with Costco who are having a 70.00 rebate on Bridgestone. Let's compare apples to apples.  That tire at Discount tire was 100.00 more. The exact tire. But the assistant manager also told me to take the two star tire because Bridgestone has no miles warranty?  NO miles warranty??? Are you kidding.  I didn't believe him.  He also tried to change his story by telling me that the two star tire he quoted me on was just as good as the 3 star Bridgestone, when five minutes earlier he said the opposite.  I told him I would think about it it.  I went to Costco and the EXACT tire has a 70k mile warranty.  I will never go to Discount Tire again, and I suggest you don't too!
