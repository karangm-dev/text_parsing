Horrible business practices at this hotel. They over booked their rooms, so when we showed up our reservations meant nothing. Booked online and then the day before our arrival called just to make sure all was good. They offered to look around town to find us a room. Thought that was the point of making reservations. I'm sure if we hadn't shown up they would have still charged the credit card used to make the reservation.
