What a bunch of fucking idiots running this place. Tried to return keyboard that died & i had phoned into customer service..no problem, come on in. WRONG!!! Keyboard i had purchased does not match model # on receipt. Who's fault is that. Stupid computer did not read SKU correctly. So guess who is stuck with a keyboard that does not work..ME.  Tried logic with these high school dropouts, that was way over their heads. Anyway, last time i go to this store . Best Buy is dying just for reasons like this. Stick with Amazon. Best Buy will be Good Bye soon.
