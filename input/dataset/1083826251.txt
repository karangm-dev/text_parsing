This has to be one of the slowest Starbucks east of the Mississippi. I'm standing in line writing this because I have enough time, as the line is not moving at all. The customers aren't helping. How one stands in line for 15 minutes and has to think about their order when it's time is beyond me. Service is mildly friendly at best. You can't order from the app in advance at this location. The saving grace is that because it's a Starbucks, the drink quality will be consistent with the other million Starbucks worldwide. I'm still in line and have not yet placed my order. 3 people behind me have decided the wait isn't worth it. There's also a fly in the display. It's a trend. Make that 4 people. Ordered, left and picked up pizza. Waiting for my drink.....Finally, I have my drink. The barista was nice. Starbucks has to do better. They need to send someone from corporate to boost production here.
