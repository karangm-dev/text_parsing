When we got there we asked to wait on the side by the washroom, we grabbed a drink and a few minutes later we were seated at a counter table beside the kitchen. We had there appetizers and a couple rounds of drinks. Food was pretty good but felt the waitress was rushing us, taking away our food even while we still eating it, twice.
