Another great restaurant by this group! Had the bacon wrapped date meatballs, truffle oil fries, Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta, and rice au gratin with chicken. Usually get an order of the Cajun shrimp and chicken pasta to go. Everything was so delicious! Love Oyshi, Soyo, and now this place. The decor feels so elegant and the location is very convenient. Have had a few birthday dinners here and this restaurant was an accommodating perfect setting. Staff is great and very helpful. The manager is engaging and really does his job well. Always a pleasure eating here! There are a few new dishes added to the menu and I can't wait to try! Tried a few of the new dishes. Tried the smoke salmon crostini and the langosta bruschetta for appetizers. Both were pleasant. For the main courses I had BBQ baby back ribs and the basil sausage linguini. The meat on the ribs just fell off the bone, so tender. The basil linguini has great flavors, but also has a rich heavy cream kick that is dense. Was happy to see this place was packed! As always, a great dinning experience.
