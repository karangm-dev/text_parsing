Well what can I say.  The owners are very nice and try.  I think the wife should do more then seat people.  She could pass food around while the husband cooks diff meats.They use like four of the same meats but say their different, for example adding garlic sauce on it counts as one.  Wine comes with the Groupon, however if you don't want it, you only get one soda.I started feeling sick before I left and believe I have food poising.  I've been gone less then 25 mins and been in the bathroom three times already.    The meats are cooked on the grill not like Texas de Brazil when they have all the meats cooking on a rotational cooker.I would try it.  Spend they extra 10 and go to Texas de Brazil..  I wanted to like this place, I did.. oops back to bathroom!!
