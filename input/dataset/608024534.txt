Office on Miles Road is friendly and thorough. The dental hygienist answered my questions,  and I thought she did a nice job. When she finished, Dr. Glick checked her work, made small talk and was pleasant. I had new insurance and the front desk person told me about a few services with that insurance. I scheduled my next appointment. Very happy.
