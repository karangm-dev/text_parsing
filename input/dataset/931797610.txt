We ordered mozzarella sticks and marinara for a friend we're going to meet, a double beef n cheddar and an original beef sandwich. The woman that took our order was great... Order was quick and fries were hot so I started at 5 stars with that because that doesn't typically happen with fast food restaurants. Got into the car to travel to our somewhat distant destination and was too hungry to wait so we pulled out our sandwiches- oh hey! Look! They forgot my cheddar. Surprise surprise. Whatever, I got over it. I get an idea thinking, they only screwed up once and didn't forget my friends marinara. Nope, squash that. So much for that. Two stars down, I decided hey, you know what. We have to drive back this way after the couple hours we're out here for so maybe they'll fix this and refund the cheddar so I call. After about 15 rings a woman answers it and says "hold on a second" while I get placed on hold. About a minute later my phone gets that sweet click where they hang up on you. So I dropped another star and decided this review was necessary. Thanks for nothing!
