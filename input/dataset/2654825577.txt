I went in here with a friend on Saturday night- should've read the reviews on here first! We were in the beachwood area, and figured a big sports bar and restaurant would be the right place to go to watch an out-of-town hockey game. How foolish of us. Despite the fact that this place must have 30+ TV's, with 5 or more playing the same NCAA football game, and a few playing another out of town hockey game, the staff REFUSED to tune one of the TVs to the game we wanted to watch. We clearly said- "if you can put the game on, we'll stay. Otherwise, we're leaving." They wouldnt put the game on, so we left. Luckily another bar in the area was more accommodating and we got to see the game.
