I went to Burlington to look for school uniforms for my 3 grandchildren, well couldn't find anything so I asked the cashier what time they closed so i could go into az mills mall to look at other stores and she said at 9:30 p.m well it was a Sunday and I found out they closed at 6:30, that wrong info got us locked out  the store from Az mills mall entrance and I had parked in front of burlington coat factory parking lot, wow I was upset because me and my 4 grandchildren had to walk around the mall to get to our car, and that could of been avoided if that cashier from Burlington would have gave me the correct info.
