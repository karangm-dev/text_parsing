This vet is horrible! Used to be great but not anymore!! I went here because my dogs nail/toe was bleeding and dr LaShay said her nail wasn't broken like I had thought and it was possible there was a crack and to just give her some anti inflammatory and she would be fine. I paid $100.00 for this and Well today  I walked into my hallway and there was a ton of blood and she has a huge gash under her nail on her toe. Had Dr LaShay taken the time to inspect my dogs paw carefully this definitely could have been prevented. This vet over charges and I will be requesting a full refund or disputing the charge with my bank. This used to be a decent place even though they are expensive, but Dr LaShay does not take the time that other vets do and has a lazy approach. I highly recommend going somewhere else. They are negligent and don't even deserve 1 star.
