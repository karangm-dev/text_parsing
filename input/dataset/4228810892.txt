If you like to pay double then go to Automotive Specialty.  They do offer a free cookie at the end.If you like to save money and are trying to lose weight call around a get a second estimate.  That cookie is costing you hundreds.Trust me shop around and you will not return to Automotive Specialty.  Note:  We (my wife) trusted them for 7 years.  I always had my doubts.  Finally,  my wife says "I do not trust them anymore."
