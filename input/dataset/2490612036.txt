I had been searching for a cpap provider.   I took in the paperwork from my Dr.   they told me the needed one more piece of paperwork and would contact the dr.    Three months later after i called and left messages nothing.  I finally got ahold of someone. They told me that tue paperwork i dropped off still needed one piece of paperwork from dr.   I stated i know and they knew.   She stated they would now call dr to get itTwo months later after i called several time with no answer or return calls to my messages they tell me the same thing but now its been over three months so they need all new paperwork.    DONT GO. HERE.  The reviews are accurate and they don't care to change and it is a total waste of time.   Im now six months into trying to get anything from them and I'm worse off than when i startedDon't go here.  They need shut down
