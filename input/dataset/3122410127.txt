I have had a lot of waxes at a lot of places, and I don't think I will every go anywhere else! They don't lie, their wax easily is better and hurts less! I dread waxing because of the pain and when they told me their comfort wax wouldn't hurt as bad I did but believe them but it's true!!I see Jamice. She was pretty difficult to get to know, she seemed pretty stand offish amen I first met her but she is great now! At first I really wished she would be more personal especially because I was so uncomfortable but she does a great job and she has warmed since.
