Was in Scottsdale on business (fortunately I have family there also) and my aunt wanted to have Italian for dinner. Note: this review only includes a review of my entree. My aunt ate her dish so I'm assuming it was tasty. I ordered the pappardelle with bolognese sauce. The restaurant was fairly empty but the entrees took a long time to come out. The house bread was cold, hard, and served with a tomato butter type spread (didn't care for it). The nice waiter was very personable and continued to check on us, but the food still took too long. My entree finally arrived; large ribbon sized pasta with a chunky bolognese sauce in a deep red tomato base, with freshly shaved Parmesan on top. Looked magazine picture perfect, I was ready to dig in! The acidity of the meat sauce was very prevalent, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth. I took a total of four bites (thinking it would improve somehow); the meat sauce tasted sour (as in spoiled, although I'm sure it was not). If I had to summarize, the meat tasted like it came out of a can. The waiter asked how our food was (I was totally prepared to smile and lie, but my aunt encouraged me to answer the question truthfully). The waiter was immediately apologetic, took my entree off our bill (which I kept contesting no need I will pay, I'm just answering your question truthfully). He insisted on taking the entree off and asked a couple times if I wanted to order something else. By this time we had been there almost two hours (arrived around 5:45pm, preparing to leave at 7:40pm), and my aunt needed to get home. Fortunately, my work friends planned to dine at Ruth's Chris next door at 8pm, so I joined them since I hadn't eaten. The other patrons food looked great, maybe I ordered the wrong dish
