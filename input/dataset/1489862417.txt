I decided to give them another shot in hopes that I would get some HOT FRIES with my order #FAIL! Once again I get cold fries & a manager named Morgan who seemed as if he could care less. Terrible.  Corporate if you are reading this you guys should address this with your managers.  Not cool that EVERY SINGLE one of your Farmer Boys in Las Vegas serves cold or  french fries that have been doubled dipped fries to customers. Thumbs Down!
