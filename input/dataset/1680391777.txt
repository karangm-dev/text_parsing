My visit to Switch was disappointing.  Despite the fact that we had bottle service booked for a large party, we were made to wait outside in the pouring rain (there is no overhang or awning) for almost 15 minutes.  I could not figure out the reason for this, as who was let in at what time seemed arbitrary.  By the time we got in, my hair was ruined, and I was soaked to the skin and shivering.The decor of the club is really cool, with lots of exposed brick.  However, the layout leaves much to be desired. The large number of bottle service areas made it difficult to move from one place to another.  There wasn't a lot of room for dancing, which is too bad because I was enjoying the music for the most part.The washrooms are ridiculous.  The lineup was almost 10 minutes long for three miserable stalls.  I will say that the hostess for our section was really nice, and made sure that we were well stocked.  However, after having to wait outside in the rain again for 5 minutes for re-entry after going outside for a cigarette, I decided that I was over it, and made it an early night.
