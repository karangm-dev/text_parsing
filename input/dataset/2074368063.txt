Ok .... I'm a hard guy to please when dining out. More often than not I come home disappointed. This place has AWESOME food there is no disputing this. The rating is that high for a reason. Im not going to rant about the food, I'm sure enough people have done that already. What else can you say? I will however rant about the staff. From Management to the Servers, to the Cooks ( whom by the way should be called Chefs) All we're above friendly, Very helpful, patient (my first time..from NJ..live here now) all looked after each other's customers #STRONGTEAM, and the attention to detail was that of a fine dining level. NOT that it's a super fancy place, that's not what I'm saying. I sat at the bar far two seats to the right. Right in front of me was the Window where the Chefs put the food up.I saw food thrown away because it sat a little to long and wasn't to temp therefore , not up to the standards for their customers. I saw the small blonde lady climb to communicate and check the food, literally Lift eggs to make sure they were cooked properly. I even saw a cook pick out a single piece of potato because it was charred. WHO DOES THAT IN A BREAKFAST JOINT...I'm just blown away by all the happy employees working hard and working efficiently together for one reason... make the customers happy. As a Team leader in a Henderson Ford dealership who Ironically has a diner in it, I applaud you all for #1 probably the best meal I have had in Vegas yet. #2 Making the beginning of my day a great one...problem is... I now could never go to another place for breakfasted lunch. Thank youTom
