This was a very fun escape room! My dad flew in from overseas and so we decided to all go do this. We did the VIP package so the only people in our group was just the ones that came with us. At the end we got a free shirt, picture and hat. Definitely worth the $89 a person! Plus the actress we had with us she was amazing! All the rooms were great! They saved the bathroom for the very last room which was cool! We will definitely be going back multiple times I'm sure!
