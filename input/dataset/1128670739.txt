HIGHLY RECOMMEND! I've been coming year for years, even with my mom as a minor. My first visit I came here and got a double nose piercing. My piercer was extremely knowledgeable and quick. Later on Nicola did my septum and let me tell you it was my least painful piercing. My septum healed so well and the placement is perfect. My daith piercing was perfectly placed and pierced too. The last time I came in was on my 18th birthday to get my nipples pierced. Jd made the process really comfortable and it hurt way less than expected. Really on top of of their store and who they hire. Clean too.
