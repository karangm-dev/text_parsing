So happy they finally opened one in North Scottsdale. Love the set up, two stories, great patio and great service. We went here opening week and the wait was a little long so they paid for a round of our drinks for being so patient. This has definitely become a regular place for us to go.  We love bringing friends and family here, even if it's just for a drink.
