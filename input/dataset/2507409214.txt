I love love love this place!I have been twice- the first time I went with my husband and the second time I went with my cousin. Both times I loved the food and so did my lunch date. I tried the special on my first visit and had a marinara pizza with some amazing cheese- sorry to say I don't remember what kind it was but it was delicious.My husband tried the prosciutto pizza with arugula on top- also delicious and the ingredients were very fresh. On my second visit I indulged in the lunch special and for $20 I got an appetizer, main course and dessert. I had the caprese salad with beets first. It was nice and light. Then I opted for the duck confit pizza. It was so delicious! The duck was spread out on the pizza with pieces of pear that complemented it so well. The crust is perfect and I ALMOST finished the whole thing in one sitting. I was excited to take a piece home though for later. For dessert- coffee flavoured gelato! Perfect ending.My cousin had the cremini mushroom pizza- although I don't love mushrooms all that much it looked divine and she really liked it. The service is excellent. The prices are fantastic. The pizza is out of this world and the atmosphere is so inviting. I love the decor in the restaurant and I will definitely be going back. I have a tonne of friends already asking me to take them here for lunch.p.s. they even have purse hooks under the bar to hang your bag!
