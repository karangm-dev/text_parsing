Not really sure how to rate Tom's, we had gone a few times in March of 2017 and then again in September of 2017 so we're really looking forward to going back when we came in April. We had been salivating just thinking about the hash browns. It's the first place we went when we arrived on Sunday! But oh my horrible does not describe how bad they were!!!! The hash browns looked as though all they had done was thaw them and did not cook them at all. We base this on the fact they were cold, and the same color as straight out of the freezer and the cheese had never been melted. A women came over and asked how everything was and we told her the potatoes were not cooked and I had ordered Swiss cheese in my omelet and was given cheddar. She took mine back and they remade my omelet and gave me what I think were new potatoes. While the omelet was good the potatoes had not much improved they definitely were put in a skillet as the cheese had started to melt but the potatoes were lukewarm and basically raw. We had planned on eating all 3 days we were there but did not go back. Very disappointing.
