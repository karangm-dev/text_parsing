best filet i ever had. asparagus , mushrooms and au gratin were all to die for. smores dessert was pretty good and very nice touch to end the meal . only complaint was that my waitress wasnt too attentive being it was wednesday and not at all busy. she was more interested in gossiping with the hostess' but food made up for it.
