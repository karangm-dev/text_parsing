Some of the best falafel I have ever had. Definitely the best falafel in Cleveland. I got their falafel with hummus and tabbouleh, and my friend got the falafel with french fries. Can you imagine anything more heavenly than falafel and french fries?!. It was delicious! I loved the way the tahini sauce mixed with the sriracha. My problem with most falafel is that it's dry, but not this one. There was enough sauce, and the falafel was fried perfectly. Grab a ton of extra napkins though, as the sauce will start to drip all down your arm. I may or may not have licked a bit off in public. No shame.  Seriously debated licking it off the table I was at, but didn't want to get splinters in my tongue.
