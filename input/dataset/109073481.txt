Dined for lunch on November 27, 2015 - We made OpenTable reservations for noon. We came 5-10 minutes prior and were told they weren't open yet. Whoops! Hint: Then don't make a noon reservation available if you can't even be ready by noon. When the place was officially open, they didn't even seat us first. They let other people that didn't have reservations be seated first, then decided to seat us. Not cool. We of course had the pre-fix lunch for $25.15/person. It's not like there's any other choice. Oh, and the other things on the menu that seem like it could actually taste good are an additional $10.00. Really?!?! Then why show us??What I chose (without having to add additional $10.00 here or there):Appetizer: Greek Meze Plate - Tarma, Tzatziki, Salami manor cheese, olives & cherry tomatoesMain Course: Corade Royale - grilled Mediterranean Sea BreamDessert: Karidopita with kaimaki ice creamLet's just say I could only enjoy the freshness of the Corade Royale. Everything else I couldn't really eat and did not enjoy the taste at all. Maybe it's because I'm no Greek cuisine connoisseur, but I only enjoyed the entree...overall, disappointed in their service and menu, hence making my experience and recommendation a one star (thank goodness the entree was good).
