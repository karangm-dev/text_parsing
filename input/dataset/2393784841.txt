When there are SO MANY other choices, why shop from a place that has ZERO customer service and follow up.   This company is run by an absolute A*****E.. They sold me a "Kamado Rocket" which is a beautiful piece of art, but does not work due to terrible metal work, and they have no intention of fixing their $3,000 POS.DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT do business with this company.
