Absolutely disappointing, eggs were horrible biscuits were dry as the Sahara desert, brisket I ordered moist was dry, best thing hey had to offer was mimosas, bacon and French toast, I sat for an hour waiting for the server to come over so that I could speak to a manager she never came back safe to say I don't think I could be paid to return to this bit to mention 37.00Per person and I had to look at a dirty podium
