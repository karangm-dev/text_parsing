Not sure why this place is getting such mixed reviews.  Went with a friend for the first time last night and we had an excellent experience.  The waitress was very friendly and courteous, and made sure we were happy with our orders and kept our water glasses filled.  We decided to split their vegan tamales and chicken tacos, and both dishes were outstanding.  I'm actually not usually a fan of tamales in general, but theirs were flavorful, nice amount of filling, and the maza was just the right amount of thickness.  The chicken tacos were just as flavorful and very well portioned with lots of chicken.  We both enjoyed the food immensely and said we would definitely be back to visit again.
