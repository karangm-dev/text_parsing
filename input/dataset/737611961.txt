I went here for my bachelorette party last year & was here last weekend with my husband and family. I would say it doesn't feel like a steakhouse, but more like a lounge that serves steak. I did enjoy the ambiance, very Vegas-like with the colorful lighting and the upbeat music. Reservations is a must. We started with the caviar on creme fraiche & potato pancakes. Yummy.  For our entree we ordered the bone-in ribeye for 2 for $89. It was delicious! The service was excellent & our sommelier did a superb job. Along with the bottle of wine, we spent $200 for the 2 of us. Not bad. Can't wait to try their other dishes.
