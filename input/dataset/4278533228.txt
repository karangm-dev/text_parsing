We've been coming here frequently for over a year. Food is consistently good, and customer service is always helpful and pleasant! This is our favorite neighborhood Thai restaurant. Whether dining in, picking up, or getting food delivered, you won't be disappointed. Thank you for always feeding me Lucki Thai!
