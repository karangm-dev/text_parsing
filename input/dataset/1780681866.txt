Its no secret that Im as cheap as it gets and any place that serves up a delicious hot breakfast for $2, is more than alright by me.Seriously, nothing gets me fired up quite like a sweat deal - and good luck trying to find a better deal than this.We're talking eggs, your choice of breakfast meats (i personally prefer the sausage), home fries, toast and coffee.  $2 bucks - straight up.  I mean - seriously...  $2 bucks!You cant even buy a back alley BJ for that price anymore.  And I promise you that if you can, it wont be nearly as satisfying as this breakfast..
