My move in has been awful.  It started with being notified at 6:30pm the night before I was to move in to let me know that my apartment was not ready.  'Not ready' is an understatement.  I choose to move in Oct. 1st so I could have a newly renovated apartment - I signed my lease papers in July.  My 'newly renovated' apartment consists of a page long of problems - which will be at my inconvenience to have fixed.  The apartment was not cleaned from the last tenant - absolutely disgusting.  There is nothing 'ultimate in style' as they advertise.  The worst renovation style I have ever seen.  I was told 'it will be beautiful, everything new from flooring to appliances'.  Unfortunately the new flooring has paint all over it and the new appliances are either scratched or dented.  The newly painted cabinets look terrible and the door pulls are not even.  The newly painted walls left over spray on all the outlets and light switches, plus the ceiling and floors.  I offered to wait a week to move in, so everything could be finished.  The management said it would be ready in two days.   I would not recommend this property.
