Went to Cinema Hair based on reviews and the particulars listed on their website. All in all, I was completely happy. Nicole cut my hair exactly the way I asked and she made inquiries along the way to ensure I was getting the cut and style I wanted. Would highly recommend to any guy, as she knows her stuff. Great service and the price was very fair.
