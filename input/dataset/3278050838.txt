Horrible customer service, I purchased a 200 dollar software called dragon nuance for mac, the employee whether new or old when I purchased it opened the product and was informed by another employee that was against protocol. After realizing that it wasn't the software I needed I attempted to bring it back and was refused since it was already opened and it had been over a week despite the fact it was within the -5 day window and hadn't been activated. Very disappointed and will not be shopping at Best Buy at all going forward.
