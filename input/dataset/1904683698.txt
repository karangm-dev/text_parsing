I love this Capriottis! I don't eat meat and normally don't like most fake meats but they have an awesome vegetarian cole turkey. I highly recommend it. Their employees are really laid back and they are always super giving with the ingredients they put in their sandwiches. Try this sandwich shop and you won't regret it, trust me!
