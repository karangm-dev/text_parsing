Life center plus is a very nice facility but over the past year I have experienced little girls in the men's adult locker room where the open showers  are located.  Today there were two naked men in the hot tub along with a little girl while two other men showered in plain sight. She looked confused and in disbelief at what she was seeing. This is uncalled for when they do offer private changing areas and also have a hot tub pool side. Children do not belong in a hot tub to begin with. The locker room needs to be monitored to prevent this.these girls had to range from 4 to 8. It seems to be an ongoing problem.  I've filed reports also made it known to management again and intend to inform the mothers about what their obviously ignorant husbands are subjecting their daughters to. I won't be back.
