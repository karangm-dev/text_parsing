NOT RECOMMENDED!!!!    0/10   -Wish I could give this business 0 stars.Unprofessional staff, absolutely rude during party time. The bartenders were so rude, they were not even paying attention to the guests. I am so heartbroken for even organizing a party here. Some of the banquet hall staff members was just chilling with the bartender, talking, and one of the bald guys with glasses was actually downright offensive in his mannerisms, the way he was dealing with the guests. One of the older gentlemen in the party accidentally was about to walk behind the bar (he had a drink or two), and was stopped as soon as he was told by the bartender without any confrontation, but this overzealous staff member (they bald guy with the glasses) started chanting the Arizona statute for what happens when someone walks behind the bar like there was a crime in progress, and he wasn't even serving drinks, he was actually just chilling with the bartender, distracting him by just non nonchalantly talking.My suggestion to anyone who's planning to organize a party here, spend some more money and go somewhere else, the staff here is downright unprofessional and rude. They standard of providing service is not up to the mark as compared to so many other fantastic banquet halls in Chandler, Phoenix, Scottsdale etc.Thanks for reading!
