This place is pretty ordinary.  Not great but not bad.  As one reviewer noted, the physical structure is really big.  It seems like you are eating in an empty barn - a nicely decorated barn, but still big.We sat on the patio this latest time.  Very pleasant, although the music was too loud and blaring.  It was distracting rather than adding to the ambiance.  In addition, you could occasionally get smoke for the cigar bar a few doors down.  Also, there was a whiff either of the sewer or maybe excess propane from the fireplace.The food was okay.  We had appetizers.  The server told us the crab cakes were great, very little filler and lots of crab meat.  Nope.  Just the opposite.  It was filler all the way.The tuna sliders were excellent, although you have to like ginger and Dijon mustard a lot.  I do, so I thought there were excellent,  But they are heavy on the ginger and Dijon.We also had the Brussels sprouts.  Again, the server said they were excellent, saut√©ed with bacon, etc.  Well, there was no bacon in sight, and they could have been cooked a little more and a little more evenly.  Lastly, we had the tenderloin bits.  They were good, but only when you added one or both of the tasty sauces that came with them.  But they were pretty good.Overall, there does not seem to be anything special about this place.  Just a run of the mill big box steak house.
