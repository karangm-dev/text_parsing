Stoped in for lunch today for the first time. Atmosphere was cool with an open indoor outdoor seating and a huge rollup door. Very reasonable prices for the food. Tried the pulled pork, brisket, sausage and coleslaw. The meat was cooked perfectly not dry or overly salted. Vinegar slaw was also  wonderful. Great lunch spot, their chef Randy is doing a great job.
