I have noticed when 2 guests come and sit on a 4-seating table, the owner always makes it a point to move them saying that maybe there will be a lot of people who in and it will be a hassle to move them later so they shift to the smaller tables.i consider it pretty rude to do that when almost all the tables are empty and in the 2 days I visited, the restaurant was never completely full.
