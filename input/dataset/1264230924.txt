I have been needing to write a review for this place. Since this place opened I have tried multiple dishes. The last time I came in, my bf ordered a burger medium; When I say this is the best burger he has ever had, I mean they whole-heartedly went out of their way with an art. He said this is the best he ever had. This man usually complains no matter how legendary a restaurant is. I ordered the caprese salad which was memorable in every bite.
