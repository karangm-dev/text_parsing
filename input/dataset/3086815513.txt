Be careful with this guys, they're a bunch of crooks. Went in got a quote for $41 told them I had a $5 off coupon. They told me my new cost would be $49. WTF? They tried telling me my car required 6 qts of oil? Told them to stop anything they stared. Went down the road to Purcells and paid $19 for oil change
