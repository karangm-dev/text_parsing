Excellent fried chicken and biscuits.  Salad was fresh, not overly dressed.  Fried green tomatoes with toppings were very good.Wait staff was friendly, prompt and observant. Did not have to ask for refills or anything else, they were always on top of things.  I especially like that they change your plates between courses and make accommodations to the order sizes as needed.Very comfortable seats and nice ambience; elegant southern charm to the whole place.Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Las Vegas.  Located in the Venetian/Palazzo restaurant row.
