I had a great massage! The masseuse I had was really strong and made sure she wasn't using too little or too much strength throughout the massage. They also had really great service and good tea with the massage. I really liked that they made sure the duration of your massage was exactly what you paid for because some places start your duration earlier than when your massage begins.
