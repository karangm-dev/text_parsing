Bottom line: Any other rental car company at sky harbor is a better choice than Budget. Unless you are a masochist, probably a good idea to stay away from Budget rental car in general.Review: Budget rental car is actually the tenth circle of Hell that Dante didn't yet know about. An almost two hour wait to get a car. Three incompetent employees working the counter. It's the last place very bad people go after they've been through all nine circles. The experience of being a budget rental car customer is like paying to be tortured. The collected mass of disgruntled customers sharing the experience with me applauded in unison when two additional employees emerged from the back room, bringing the total customer service representatives to five. That genius staffing decision took 90 minutes to accomplish, yet somehow the line continued to move at a pace DMV customers would smile gleefully and laugh at. I will never rent from budget rental car again.
