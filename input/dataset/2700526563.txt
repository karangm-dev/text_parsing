So happy with my service today. I went in with a nail in my tire and a slow leak, in about 15-20 minutes I was back in my car and my wheel was fixed with not a single cent being spent. All of the people who worked there were polite and informative and fast working. I had come from a different location where I was told to wait 60-90 minutes from an extremely rude employee, but this location was the complete opposite. Not only was I in and out super quick, the service was done free of charge and they wouldn't even accept a tip. I will never be going anywhere else for anything tire related!
