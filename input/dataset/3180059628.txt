I saw the other reviews and thought - I'll try it- I came for lunch - first of all the loud obnoxious television was too much - stupid games shows in Spanish - you just can't get away from it- forget conversations with friends - terrible decor and the service was bad - part of my lunch order was with chips and salsa - never got it - the beer arrived after the tacos - NOT what the other reviews said at all!  Won't be back - try somewhere else - the carne asada tasted tainted and really after everything else??  Plus it is 103 degrees outside and no a/c and no ceiling fans turned on!
