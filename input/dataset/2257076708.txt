Ok, today finally tried this restaurant, I live in erie pa, don't have this kind of food, I was craving for this.  My husband order pork chop with white rice, only 1 little piece, taste so common, it cost $10, if it is taste good, don't mind, but....... order the Pho noodle, the soup was so so, just salty, little disapointed, next will try different place.
