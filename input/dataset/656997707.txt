The food and presentation is amazing, but the service and wait time for food delivery needs improvement. We sat in the outdoor area on hard wood bench seats and had to wait 30+ minutes to get our food. It took the waitress three trips to deliver the proper number of waters to a table of 7. After that point we paced ourselves on our drinks because we didn't know when the waitress would be back for refills. While waiting for our food, a waiter passed by our table carrying trays and ended up dropping them, splashing sauces on a member of my party--all on her arm, with spots on her shirt and shorts. The waiter did say sorry and bring wet towels, but when asked if we'd get discounted for an entree he said, "this happens all the time". Wow, no "I'll ask my manager" or even an offer for a free desert...nothing. When our food finally did come out the waiter first delivered to the wrong table. The food tastes great with good-sized portions, but I don't think I'd go back or recommend it to a friend.
