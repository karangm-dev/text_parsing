Honestly I get wait until Mid-September when this event starts. Ideally I would go at least one weekend day because the bands are different each weekend which gives each one a different feel. You can get a reservation inside for 6 or more but I'm not even sure how far in advance you need to call to get one so we just eat outside in the tents which works for me. The event has a family feel with kids until about 8pm or so and then it gets a little more adult after. Food is great. Beer is great and it is just a boatload of fun. Take an Uber there.
