Listen, I've written enough reviews about the many Filiberto's across the valley that I would be regurgitating old stuff over and over again. Seriously though, I've been to about 5 of them in AZ, and after moving to Boston I'm kind of hoping that AZ might be willing to donate me a Filiberto's. There is nothing like it anywhere. I used to be skeptical about this place, but then I tried it, and I've been addicted since. Sadly enough, because of my closed mind, I only got to have it for the last 3 out of the 22 years I was in Phoenix.If you're a snob who likes to eat arugula salads with steamed fish or some other healthy food, don't come here. If you're a Chipotle snob, don't come here. Don't get me wrong, I love Chipotle, but Filiberto's is just different.
