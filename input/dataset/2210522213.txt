Ate dinner here the first night we cane to Vegas, then decided to come here on our last day for breakfast. The food is good. It's diner style food, but I would say definitely better than Denny's. Extremely large portions, so if you'd like to share, it's plenty to go around. BIG disappointment when after finishing my food and the last stop of my coffee, i found that the bottom of my coffee cup had a long piece of hair in it. It was disgusting, considering i had already finished eating and had a refill of the coffee, but hadn't seen the hair when i drank the first round, since the refill came in before the cup was done. So the hair was sotting at the bottom the whole time.   I would have given this place 5 stars had it not been for the hair.
