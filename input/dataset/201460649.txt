I have been going to Ladybug for many months now & I will never go back. I literally had the order taker on the phone ASK me for a tip. Now mind you, I always tip. I forget one time on accident because I was on the phone at work & I feel like I'm being grilled about how they use their own car to drive to me & blah blah blah. Where they deliver to is literally 2 minutes away, if you can't afford to not get your $2 tip, you need to talk to your boss, not me. Not to mention, I had a toothpick in my sandwich. Not the one it's closed with but one actually in there. I bit into it. I told the lady on the phone & she proceeded to tell me they close their sandwiches with toothpicks & I told her I took that one out, this one I bit into. She proceeded to tell me that never happens & then offered to say she'd "take care of me" next time but with an attitude. Next time came & it never happened. So I'm done with this company. I'll go somewhere else from now on.
