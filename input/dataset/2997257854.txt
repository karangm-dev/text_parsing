One of the best nail salon experiences I've had. They were super welcoming and gave me a tour of the salon while I waited. The salon is designed beautifully and there's endless nail polish options. Christine ended up doing my nails and they turned out exactly how I wanted them! She's very sweet and precise with her work. I have super flimsy and short nails so she gave me recommendations on what manicure would be best for them and she will be working with me on growing/strengthening them. I don't think my experience could have been any better, I'll definitely be going back.
