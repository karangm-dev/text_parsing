I purchased a treadmill from this store and arranged to have it delivered and set up at a future date. I was told that the delivery window would be between 9 and noon on June 28th 2017. After completing the purchase, I texted my wife telling her that the 2 associates I had dealt with were "Idiots" they spent the whole time they were with me trying to tell the other to do the other one's job. At 9:35 AM, on delivery day I received a call informing me that the delivery truck would arrive in 45 minutes to deliver my purchase. I waited until 12:58 PM before calling the delivery service to see what had happened to the delivery truck, which never showed up. I spoke to a gentleman in New Jersey who informed me that rather than ordering a delivery of a treadmill, the order was written to deliver an exercise bike. There is a considerable difference between the weight of a treadmill and that of an exercise bike. The treadmill would require 2 men to deliver it. That being the case, I took a day off work,  lost a day's pay, have no treadmill, and have to reschedule the delivery of the equipment the I have yet to receive.  This will probably require another day off work. I contacted the store to get their side of the story and to determine what the next step would be. I was connected to an associate (Not a manager) who could not give me any answers of offer satisfaction.  Now I am left to wait for the delivery company to contact me to set up another delivery date. I have experienced very little but incompetence, laziness, and childish behavior during this process. Not the service one would expect after spending in excess of $1600.00
