Friends and I decided to try out an Indian restaurant closer to our place rather than trek up to the reliably tasty Bombay Mahal. Big mistake. The waiter seemed annoyed at our requests (e.g., an order of channa with our samosas) and got a few things wrong, even though we clarified in both English and Hindi. The sauces were bland and overly oily, the paneer was dry (almost hard, really) and strangely sweet, and most of the dishes tasted the same. The best thing was actually the plain basmati rice. Next time we'll be going back up to Jean-Talon, even in a snowstorm.
