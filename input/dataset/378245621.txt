First time ordering delivery and found 2 hairs in my pizza.  The long one was embedded in the cheese so when I pulled the hair from my mouth, the bite I just took was still attached to the hair.  My wife then found the smaller one (beard? eyelash? pube?) on her slice.  I try to support small local businesses often, but this is just gross.
