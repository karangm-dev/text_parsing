Placed the to-go order at 10:50.  Was told it'd be ready in 15 minutes. I walked out of Denny's at 11:33 with my refund right when manager walked up with my order. Not also did he not apologize or try to rectify the problem, he just opened the cash register and slapped cash on the counter and walked away... versus reversing the credit card transaction!  How impersonal & rude! If I had known it'd take that long, I'd hit a drive thru on my way. Or sat down to eat!!!I would have given 1 star but I could tell the cashier was getting agitated with their service and could tell if she could rectify the issue, she would have done so!
