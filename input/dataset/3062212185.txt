While John's (our server) performance was impeccable, I doubt we'll be returning any time soon. My crab cake was VERY fishy tasting and Tuesday's only offered a very blah cocktail sauce - no teriyaki, soy or other flavor masker. My bride's chicken fresco was noticeably dry and her favorite vegetable, steamed broccoli, was not warm enough to melt the "butter" that John served after being asked for it. Her mashed cauliflower (which she couldn't bring herself to insist I try) was "not quite what I remember".We didn't partake of the salad bar ... it was nicely presented but compared to Dessey's or a Sizzler it was seriously lacking.Bottom line, if we get another ($10 max) 2 for 1 coupon we might return for a (see previous ratings) highly rated turkey burger. On the other hand, In-N-Out  is hard to resist when it come to burgers.BTW, I'm glad we didn't take the (5 & 13) kids with us. There was nothing that would have appealed to them on the menu and we'd have had to stop at McDonald's to feed them later.
