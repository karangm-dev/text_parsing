I have friends who come here regularly so I thought I'd give it a try.  But I left very disappointed.  I should have read Julia's review prior to going because that is exactly how I felt about this place.This place is a hole in the wall.  Its access is difficult due to the proximity to Tyvola road.  It looks like this place is in an old Arthur Treacher's restaurant.  Like most mexican places,  the standard chips and salsa arrived upon entering.  The chips were crisp and unsalted.  The salsa was ok...nothing exceptional.  The pico arrived later in my meal and it was tasteless except for a little spice.  The tomatoes looked like they were once frozen.The service was decent except for My server recommending a burrito saying ti was really good.   Well that's where she was wrong.   The burrito was huge and smothered with queso.  It was the only thing on the plate and it was completely unappetizing.  It was filled with chunks of chicken, grilled peppers and onions and rice and beans. The was no real flavor to this and the primary flavor in this dish was the smothering queso.    It would have been nice if there was some color to the plate.Sorry, but service alone isn't enough to save this from a 2 star review.
