First time here while on a family vacation. Great outdoor shopping center with choices of variety of stores from food to furniture and anything in between such as jewelry, shoes, clothes, and more. Finding parking space is rather challenging due to its popularity and demand of this shopping center, but at least we were told about it at the resort when we were registering. There are water mists placed randomly throughout the entire shopping center, and it was much appreciated on a day like today where the temperature was 102F. It messed up my hair style, but I did not mind at all. We drove by here at night, and it had an ambiance similar to a well known city in southern California, Irvine. Great experience!
