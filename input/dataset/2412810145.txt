Recently in Vegas, stopped here twice. When you walk in its like being a kid again at the arcade with every type of game imaginable! 60's to the 90's, quarter machines and the coolest thing, no smoking, pinball, PAC man, and they give to charity, so you do good while having fun.  Not just pinball, affordable, worth stopping even if you're not on vacation! Be a kid, if only for an hour!
