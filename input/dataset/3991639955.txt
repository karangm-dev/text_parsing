Called ahead to make sure I could bring my dog in with me , the guy who answered was not very pleasant . Upon walking into the store I was not greeted by anyone working there , they all seemed too busy to look up from what they were doing or maybe too hot and miserable since this store was so hot and dank to stand being inside of. Since the store is poorly organized I simply needed a small recommendation on a good product for my puppy to chew on , something that would keep him busy but not go through in a ten minute chew session, feel me?... Explained this to the guy at the front , but he did not stop to look up while giving me a total lack of recommendation, not to mention I have my shih tzu puppy at my side so obviously if he looked up would be able to tell what kind of dog I'm shopping for . In other words , your customer service stinks buddy . I picked out my own products so I could get the hell out of there , the other guy who rang me up also terrible customer service did not thank me for me $15 purchase of 3 small bones/chew sticks. What's the point of being local if the big box stores stomp you in customer service , selection, and organization ? I guess by  jumping on the "locally owned" bandwagon this store somehow reeled me in since I just moved to Phoenix and am trying to support local business . Thanks but no thanks I will not return here  to purchase anything for my three pets even though your a five minute drive from my house, what a shame.
