I was also a bride that was violated by pearl bridal. I joined the Facebook group for the victims of pearl bridal. I was so not ready to start this dress shopping experience again, I was so nervous nothing would compare to the dress I had already bought. I kept seeing amazing posts about bridal boutique of az, a lot of girls found their second dress there, and how helpful they were for all of our situations. I decided to give them a try and I'm sure glad I did!! Their boutique is so cute and clean! They had a nice selection, with an amazing staff!!!! Brooke was my stylist, and I can't say enough nice words about her. She made the whole experience so much fun and about me! She treated me like a friend instead of customer. I ended up finding an even better dress with Brooke's help!! There were many hugs and tears exchanged! I can't thank Brooke enough or her manager, Jasmine, who has truely gone above and beyond to help all of the brides that were stuck in a horrible situation.
