I've been going here for years, and it is my go to cafe. I love the decor, the art, and the ambiance of the place. The staff is always super friendly, place is very clean, and it's a cafe that's different. they have super comfortable chairs and a full bar andddd.... I probably should have kept this place a secret. Def one of my hideouts/ places I go to get stuff done. Highly recommended :)
