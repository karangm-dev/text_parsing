We are visiting here on vacation and since our whole family eats gluten free were happy to stumble on to Jewels. We had breakfast the first day and enjoyed the chorizo omelet, pancakes and breakfast sandwich. The second day we came back for lunch and had grilled cheese, a BLT and the buffalo chicken sandwiches all with fries. Both days we brought home baked goods including muffins, cookies, cupcakes and donuts to try. Everything was excellent and we'll definitely make this a regular stop when we're in Phoenix.
