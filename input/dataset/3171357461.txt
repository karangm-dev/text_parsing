We came in last Sunday about 8:40 I would say. As soon as we walked in it was pretty awkward. We got asked if we wanted cold/hot food & we didn't know because we haven't looked at the menu yet. We got seated & the lady had told us they only have cold food because they're closed already. I asked "don't you guys close at 10?" Because that's what time it said on yelp and on the door it said it closes at 10 too if not I wouldn't have bothered to go in & the waitress said "no we closed at 8:30". We just got up left & took our business elsewhere.
