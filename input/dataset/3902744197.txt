I was shopping in this store with a Frind for a gift for someone. A sales guy came up to me and kept following me around trying to put some product on my arm. The product was in a big jar and it was clear that he was not changing the utensil he was using on each person as it was dirty. I kept having to repeat my self over and over again that I did not want him to smear product on my arm. He was gross and sweating profusely. He stood way to close to me and acted as if he was on some sort of drugs or had adhd. He then started reading every label around me as if I could not read. I very nicely ask him to just let me read be my self as I know how to read. I told him that if I needed any help I will ask him but I am really ok. The guy then flipped out and started screaming at me telling my to get the F out of the store and not to come back. I was shocked and told him he will get reviewed on yelp and I then took his photo which I am attaching.
