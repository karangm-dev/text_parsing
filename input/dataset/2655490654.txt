Ok, I've been living in Madison for over a year, and had been trying to find a place with decent but inexpensive chinese food. Fugu was ok, but overpriced and their delivery is slow. Ichiban seemed just ok. I've tried others with no luck. Finally I tried double 10, and I'm soooooo happy! It's really good, but also way cheaper than anything else I've found in town. I really liked the garlic sauce they have. They also had super fast service. This is my new go to Chinese place!
