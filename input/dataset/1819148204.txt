If I could give this place no stars I would. This was one of the WORST experiences I have received. I contacted them in regards to my COMPLIMENTARY consultation. (Which pretty much sums up the cost of FREE) They told me that I could come in and get an exam, and when I got there they told me I had to PAY THEM $50 out of pocket for a COMPLIMENTARY CONSULTATION and when I explained to the assistant that I was told this was for a COMPLIMENTARY consultation and I just wanted to see what my costs would be to get my braces on, she told me "It's required because we are using the machines to do X-rays", I automatically said, I called and asked if your office provided a COMPLIMENTARY consultation and she said she "called her manager" but I waited for a good half an hour and when I told her I had to leave (BECAUSE IM NOT PAYING $50 FOR A SO CALLED COMPLIMENTARY CONSULTATION) she said the manager is right outside, I went outside and did not see nobody insight, & I also waited about 5 minutes in my car to see if the manager was really there and turns out NOBODY DROVE INTO THE PARKING LOT, NOR WALKED INTO THE OFFICE. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS OFFICE TO ANYONE!
