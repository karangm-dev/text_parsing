Agree with previous posters. Order the same thing again and it will taste different. They are so inconsistent here. Also, they always seem to be running out of items like cups, lids and even some ingredients for the juice. They are also extremely slow here so don't think you're going to stop by for a quick juice on your way to work. I think these guys would be a lot busier if they got it together. But, for right now, a casual attitude and poor attention to quality and service means that they will only be successful until a more competent competitor opens up shop.
