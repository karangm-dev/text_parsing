Great location near the lake. I could walk out of either door and literally throw a stone into the water. That in itself is a great reason to stay here. It is only a couple of steps to the famous State Street of UW Madison and there is always something going on there too. It is also pretty much across the street from UW campus. The apartment itself is kept in relatively good repair compared to many of the places that I've seen directly off-campus. Mary,the owner, is a kind old lady. She's fair and she's honest. She's always busy, but she knows everyone and is super cool with them.
