So finally I found a good Indian food place in Charlotte. Tried Hyderabadi style biryani and sheekh kebab. ... but the best part was the pudina (mint) chutney which was actually made of mint and not just coriander and onions. ... however a word of caution to all my American friends who are not used to spicy food: Make sure you tell the server to tone it down :p
