Good value for the money but surprisingly bland. Anytime you can get all you can eat for $8 it's a good deal. I love Indian food but I tried everything on the buffet and did not break a sweat. For me part of what I like about Indian Food is the heat. I did notice at the end of the buffet there was a bottle of Mexican Cholula hot sauce. I guess I was supposed to use that? Even the chutney had no spice. Butter Chicken wasn't bad, Lamb Curry was very bland and watery. Can't see myself going back, I've had tastier Indian frozen meals.
