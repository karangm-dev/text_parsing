What a great apartment complex.  Have been here a few months and was invited to a Wine & cheese social for apartment residents to get together.  Not only was the presentation, beverages and appetizers first class, everyone who came had a great time - met some other very nice residents and have met other friendly people who have pets  on walks who live here.  The staff was awesome, as always.  If you have any questions or issues the staff is always right on top of it. Nice environment to live at.   Thank you.
