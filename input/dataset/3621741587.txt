This place is a hidden gem! We moved to Vegas from San Francisco last year and have been here several times since. I took some friends here last weekend, that were visiting and they fell in love with it too. The play yard in the back is a blast!! So much fun!! Drinks are super affordable. We had an adorable waitress named Anne Marie and she was awesome! Super nice, quick with our drinks, very attentive and personable. I've been a server before so I'm a bit picky but she was on it! Love this place!
