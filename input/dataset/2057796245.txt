Bought a car a used car from (newport motors)Had some issues and brought it back to be fix and was told by a suppose to be a so called "mechanics " that there was nothing wrong with it and its normal for it to be grinding/vibrating sounds when your trying to reverse. Their trying to tell me that foreign cars do do that and that its older (leas than 7 yrs)  i had one older than that and never did that and its also foreign car. Other issues wasn't fix either, was told if its not acting up right now they cant fix it.  That they ran some test and didn't find anything. Well not only that the machine is malfunctioning  i guess sane as the idiot testing it. If you cant fix it because your not certified to work on real cars then I guess you shouldn't  be working as mechanics or at least have a real mechanics look at it.
