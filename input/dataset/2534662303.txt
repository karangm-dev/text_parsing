I've been a client of Mr. Stone for the past 12+ years.  I find him to be deeply knowledgeable, highly competent, as well as honest and trustworthy.  I always feel that he has my best interest at heart.   In terms of communication - I find him to be very precise and concise when answering questions, which I greatly appreciate.  He always seems to be able to get to the root of a matter very succinctly.  His staff are super friendly, responsive, intelligent, and have great communication skills.
