This is not a resort! It is a rv park with hookups next to a large truck stop with a fabulous view of the freeway. Minimal landscaping, no water features, no tables at your site, no grass, not gated, no clubhouse. Basically all the things you would expect to see at a "resort" are not here. And it is way overpriced. It sits right on the 10 fwy which is extremely noisy!! While it is clean that's about the only positive thing I have to say about the place! Oh and yes it's priced like a resort!!!!When I spoke my concerns to management I didn't even get an I'm sorry your not happy. How can we rectify the situation. Just a comment that I should of looked at the aerial view.  Not my idea of good customer service, especially from a "resort".
