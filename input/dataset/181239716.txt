Just left after visiting during Happy Hour which is 3-7pm every day of the week. During Happy Hour we had Shrimp Cocktail and Ceviche both cost $7.95. Well drinks only $3.50 but couldn't taste any liquor in them at all and I had vodka & 7 so I should be easily able to taste the vodka.The food was OK at happy hour price but not worth more. Our main problem was the waiter was a total ass literally throwing an empty chip basket right on my place setting and my lemon that was in my water came flying out onto the table. No apology was made. I see every other review here is positive so maybe he was having a bad day but it was our first visit so we won't be back.
