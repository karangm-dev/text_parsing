Bad service and poor management. We went to dinner for my birthday. The waitress failed to get us serviceware, small plates for appetizers or refill our water.  She then brought me walleye when I ordered perch. The manager questioned whether I ordered the perch and failed to apologize for the lousy service. As we exited, the manager expressed no concern. We should have been surprised as she never came back to the table after our incompetent waitress was replaced with a waiter. We won't be going back for a long time, if at all.
