WooHoo, why wasn't this place here when I lived on Langtree.I came out to watch some college basketball and it happened to be a Primal Brewery takeover night.  A rowdy but respectful full crowd, lots of other beers on tap, and plenty of tv's.  There were even some games in the back such as shuffleboard and darts.I ended up meeting a lot of cool people that night just sitting on the front patio.  I even met a few employees and they were all super nice and helpful.  Shae and T.C. especially.  I guess they were off, but still willing to show me around and such.All in a great bar that apparently is a barber shop as well.  I'll be back if in the area.  Supposedly they even offer shuttles there and back to other location.
