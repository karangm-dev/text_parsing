I have been here a couple times now and each time I have the best time.Last night my best friend and I did BOOZE YOGA!! ‍ We had soo much fun. We arrive around 6:15 per the instructions, sat down and started a wine tasting. They accommodated our unrefined palates and let us do an all white tasting. Love that! Once our tasting was done we moved to the Grape Expectations room and got our glass of wine with the class. We chose the Rosè. We both loved that one a lot, though the other white are delicious as well. Wine and yoga was a lot of fun. The instructor was having fun while teaching which made the class light. My best friend is a yoga noob so it was nice that Tas explained things as we went. We did a few yoga poses with our glass of wine as well. :) After the class we decided that we wanted to watch the rest of the Vegas Golden Knights game and take advantage of the game day special they have. Purchase two glasses of wine, get a free pizza. The pizza was good and the couple more glasses of wine we had were excellent. The customer service by the staff is impeccable. I forgot my phone in the yoga room and my friend left her mat on her chair. Both were there and taken care of when we went back. I absolutely love this winery and am so happy to have it in Henderson!
