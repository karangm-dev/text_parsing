Bad staff...staff was not welcoming at all . I checked in online for my two boys and within 5 mins we were at great clips . On screen we were shown the first to get haircut , however they took other in . When I asked why is that -staff with raised voice this is how it works and you r next -I waited for next one and again they repeated same taking other in before us . With raised tone and bad . I left with my 2boys from there without getting haircut . Will not go again . Bad bad staff....they do not have a curtesy to talk to a customer .Worst staff
