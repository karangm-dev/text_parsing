I found this place here on Yelp - So thank you fellow Yelpers!!!It's tiny, It's cozy and very welcoming. I felt like I was at someone's home. We were 7 and squished our way in. The live music was just wonderful the food was delicious and was just like home cooking. I would suggest that they consider making a house salad dressing as the Kraft dressing was well Kraft dressing.  Every single person at our table loved their dinner. The desert crepes were dreamy. We had so much fun, we will be going back. We all hugged the cook on our way out!
