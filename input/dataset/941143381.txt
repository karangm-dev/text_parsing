$78 for three dinners and two appetizers "to go" here.. Got home and found the salad was all the white bitter core from cheap head lettuce not to mention inedible because it had a nasty rotten lettuce smell the minute we opened the plastic containers..oomph.. and the spicy shrimp appetizer was chinsy and sub par (smallest shrimp I've seen) and the chicken dinners appeared and tasted tough and microwaved.. No extra Parmesan as requested.. Olive Garden prices are horrid for the quality of food that is served here and at $18.99 an entree our dinner should have been an awesome experience whether dinning in or taking out period. Not worth the price.. I've paid less for a fabulous dinner elsewhere
