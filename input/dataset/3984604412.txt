My friend and I came in on a Friday around 4pm. There was no line which was super nice not having to wait. The dining area and the buffet stations were well cleaned all throughout. So that's a plus. Our serve Wayne was so sweet, nice and quiet funny! He was on top of his game on refilling our drinks and clearing out our dirty/empty plates. Which is something I look for at buffet services. He's definitely an awesome server. Request him if you can!As for the food, they have a sushi area with a variety of rolls and nigiri it's delicious! You can also make your own hand roll! Just ask the person behind the sushi station. They also offer caviar! FAANNCYYY! Lol first time trying it, it's definitely a texture to get use too. They offer prime rib which is juicy and warm pink which you can never go wrong in having! For the seafood loves they have crab legs. UHH YUMMMM! Crab legs were easy to break off and the meat was soft, juicy, and meaty (depending the leg size). Their dessert section is pretty bigg! They have all kinds of cake slices, variety of macaroons, cookies, fruit tart, donuts, ice cream, anddddd it goes on and on. Haha But other than that I definitely enjoyed my dining experience here. I walked out super stuffed and satisfied.  will be back!
