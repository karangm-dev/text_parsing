I went here my first night in Vegas with my mom who had talked this place up so much before we came. I was pretty disappointed when my burger arrived and the patty was burnt and tasted like someone poured the salt and pepper shakers over it for a good two minutes. The fries were the redeeming factor for this meal since they were sooo good! The service was great too which is my reason for the second star. Maybe I ate here on a fluke night, but next time I would prefer McDonalds to this place.
