I love this place! Clean and professional. I first found it on Groupon and decided to check it out. I've been going ever since and that was about 1 year ago. Genet was in her own rented room before and she is great. Professional, friendly and such a nice woman! She recently moved into her own building and hired a few estheticians, who are all friendly and welcoming as well. Most wax places are super pricey. Genet has a great deal that if you reschedule within 30 days of your last appointment you get a discount. Who doesn't love those?They are very prompt at sending our email reminders as well to let you know that you should reschedule. Then you simply click the link and schedule tight there online.
