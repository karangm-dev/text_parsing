The happiest place on Earth!OK, not quite, but this place is terrific. Really enjoyed the depth of their collection, as well as the quite interesting curatorial info cards attached to the older machines.But the best part about this place? Seeing a family of three generations simultaneously enjoying this place, for three different reasons. You don't see that every day, especially in today's Las Vegas.
