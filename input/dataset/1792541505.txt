First time here, never again.  I ordered the chicken BBQ on rice and the pieces of chicken were fatty!!  I did not know chicken could have the same fattiness that steak has but this was disgusting.  My husband had the lamb meatballs and liked them but for the price I could have had authentic Indian tandoor at cafe tandoor restaurant in Cleveland heights that is FANTASTIC.Since we were on our way to the cinemas at Chagrin we tried this place but blech - I'll never waste my $$ here again.
