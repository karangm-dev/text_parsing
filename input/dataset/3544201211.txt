THE late night spot in Phx for high quality American cuisine - lamb chops are the real superstar; the bone marrow will blow you away with flavor & simplicity; the pork chop was also a hit. Combine the impressive nocturnal menu with its chill ambience & very professional service- Joe's is the go-to spot for a civilized dining experience after 10pm. I will certainly be back!
