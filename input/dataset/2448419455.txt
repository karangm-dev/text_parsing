I waited almost five months for them to look at my knee .when I arrived for my appointment there was a line ,so I waited patiently .when I finally gave the person at the desk my information I was told I I was late for my appointment and would have to be rescheduled, the next appointment was six months away.first,I arrived well before the fifteen minutes requested by them before the actually appointment .second,i did not appreciate the comment on my cheap government insurance ....it's not my fault I was forced on it ....after reading some of the other horrible reviews I am quite happy I am not one of their patients.
