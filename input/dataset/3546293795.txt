This Pizza Hut used to offer buffets at lunch time (not sure if they still do), and although it sounds like good, clean pizza fun for $12 or so, it isn't. For whatever reason, Pizza Hut feels they don't have to make quality pizza for the buffet. They don't put as many toppings on and the crust seems to be made of cardboard. There's also a weird chemical taste, which troubles me.Anyway, they guys have to smarten up. Even their expensive pizza isn't as good as it used to be (skimping on ingredients again). I think a lot of people have already given up on the place and I have too.
