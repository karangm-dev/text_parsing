Wait time: 20 minutes. Service: pretty good, it was busy and there was only two servers so understandable that we didn't get checked on a ton. Food: AMAZING! My friend and I both got the pinko drinko smoothie and the server made sure that bee pollen (which isn't vegan) was okay with us. It was delicious!! Highly recommend. For our entrees we got the avocado basil sandwich on multi grain bread, with a local greens side salad. So good! The bread was toasted and the sandwich was delicious and filling. The salad was also great!Price was fair for the amount of food. Will definitely be back!!
