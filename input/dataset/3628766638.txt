We had heard how good this place was and got to the airport a little early so decided to partake while we waited for our plane. It was quite busy, but we were seated quickly and the waiter promptly greeted us and took our drink order. When he returned with our drinks we were ready to order our food. We ordered a couple of different pies (pizza) to share. One came out fairly quickly but the other was missing. Our waiter, Ryan, quickly realized the oversight and addressed it directly by apologizing and promising to get the other pie out as quickly as possible. After a few minutes our pie still hadn't arrived and our waiter told us he was still working on it and would take care of us. A couple of minutes later he delivered the other pie and also brought his manager by to also apologize and let us know that they would comp both pies. It was unfortunate we had this mixup, but they handled it directly and graciously and you can't ask for better than that! To top it off the pies and the drinks were delicious!! I will definitely be back next time I'm in the Phoenix area!!
