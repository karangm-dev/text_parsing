Worst experience ever.... I guess it's my first time left negative comments but definitely for me won't go back anymore. I have made reservation for the day and when I arrive they told me they don't remember they have confirmed my appointment n already other guests waiting there but they re closing in a hour. Still the lady told me it's ok they could do it. So I sit down n soak my feet into cold water... n after 20 mins, the lady told me n another girl that actually they could not help us today as they re closing soon n one of the staff actually have to leave soon... so I don't know how good they re as I guess I ll never know:(
