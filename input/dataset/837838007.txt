I rent vehicles on a regular bases and this was THE WORST experience I ever had. First, there were no cars available for customers. (Wait was 30-40 mins) Second, when I receive the vehicle, it was Filthy Dirty inside: and it smelled like cigarette smoke. Third, the car was given to me with a little over 1/2 a-tank of gas. The car was scratched and dented. PLEASE BE AWARE OF THESE THINGS SO THAT YOU WON'T BE ACCUSED OF THESE THINGS...  So, to make a long story short... BEWARE!!!! I WILL NEVER RENT HERE AGAIN!!!!
