Worst experience ever.  Ordered a prom dress for my daughter early February.  Was told by owner Lola, that the dress would leave the factory by March 14.  She told me that the gown would arrive 5-7 business day from this date.  After several calls to the shop, I was told several different stories.  I was told the dress was there; was told the would arrive the next day; was told by Lola that she had to pay extra for a speedy delivery, etc...should I go on?  Finally, on March 27, I went to the store wanting a refund.  Lola was the most nasty, arrogant, unprofessional person I ever had to deal with. After going back and forward, she finally gave me back my money.  I then had to scramble for another gown with prom being 1 week away.  Naturally, it was not going to be unique but at this point we had to take what we can get.  I would NEVER shop here again or recommend this shop.
