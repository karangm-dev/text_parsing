The worst food I have had in Vegas in 15 years !!! The etouffee $6.99 + $3.00 for a few crawfish meat that was stale at best,lobster 1.55 lbs $35.63 was so tough I almost could not get it out of the shell let alone eat it tougher than the cheapest steak not able to chew it,it was way over cooked,the claws were almost empty of meat.This place is a fraud and sham,the only good thing is the root beer and the service was very good,they should train the servers to cook and dump the cooks.
