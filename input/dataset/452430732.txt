This is the only Starbucks that charges $3.80 for espresso regardless of whether you get a double, triple or quad shot. When I asked about the price. The barista,Jennifer, said she didn't make the rules, that was just the price & to get out of her way. Poor service & exceptionally high prices. This Starbucks is not good.
