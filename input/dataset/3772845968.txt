With so many wonderful restaurants there is no reason to come here.I will never come back.Service was bad, food was bad (except the soup), atmosphere was nice although it opens into the slot machines at Luxor.If you sit at the bar, there is a huge pillar with a flat screen, which is great for watching sports, but hides you away from the bartender if you sit to the righthand side.  I had to get up and get his attention because he couldn't see me.The girl that sat down next to me actually moved to one of the tables in the lounge because the service was so bad (she did get great service from the cocktail waitress though).The Wild Mushroom soup was amazing, that is why the restaurant gets a star.  Have the soup, then go somewhere else for the main course.The steak I ordered was tasteless, I had to order a side of bearnaise sauce to get it down and I love steak; I would eat steak everyday if I could, but not from here even if it was free (which it definately wasn't).  And the bearnaise was tasteless as well.  If I hadn't enjoyed the soup so much I would have thought something was wrong with my sense of taste.The wine also tasted like it had been opened the day before or maybe even the day before that.  I'm not a wine snob, but it was like vinegar.  The bartender didn't even bother pouring a little for himself to see if it had gone bad.This was the first time in my life I had to refuse a glass of wine.
