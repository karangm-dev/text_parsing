This place was an absolute gem! You certainly do not expect to find the most delicious food inside a gas station/car wash.  I ordered the beef brisket and slow-cooked pork platter and was not disappointed. The meat was all very tender and juicy replete with an amazing selection of BBQ sauce to drown your meat in.  Personally, I do not like it when any dish comes out of the kitchen drenched in sauce, so this setup was definitely a plus in my book!  Come here if you like BBQ and good meat!
