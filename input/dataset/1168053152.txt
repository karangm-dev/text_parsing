We came in for lunch here. The restaurant has two levels. We we're group of 9 adults and a kid. The place was pathetic. We were not given napkins or silverware. The green tea came in plastic cups because they said their dishwasher did not come today. The pho was poor and trying to eat with aplastic spoon was a challenge.Would not recommend this place for service or food!
