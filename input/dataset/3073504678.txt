L'Orignal has a fantastic atmosphere and some great options. Our server Shannon was more then helpful, having great knowledge of the menu. The pear salad was a party in my mouth, so much flavor! For the main we both had the chicken dish with the mushroom puree, I had to restrain from licking my plate! When you are in Montreal I highly recommend stopping.
