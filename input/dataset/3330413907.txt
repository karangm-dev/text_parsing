There are some delicious sweets in there for sure, but: - everything is definitely overpriced. I understand everything is imported from France, because the owner keeps repeating it anytime you look interested in something (she's so overwhelming), but after I paid for my pain au chocolat, I wish I hadn't..- Staff always look awkward in their suits or in the way they interact with us- some of them (including the owner) talk to you in English, after you just answered them in French... wow.- The concept is nice but they are trying TOO hard. I come here to get a few things to get a few things I like, because I know them and even though it's pricey, I feel it's okay especially when I feel homesick. So they do get the few people from the French community like me who suck it up and pay the extra. But if they are looking for a wider clientele, they should really try another strategy. The average Canadian that doesn't know about French pastries might feel uncomfortable spending that much on something he doesn't know.
