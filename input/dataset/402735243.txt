Chicken is freaking DELISH! I've eaten a lot of fried chicken in my time and honestly didn't have my expectation level set all that high - so it was to my BEYOND PLEASANT SURPRISE when we walked in and MIKE greeted us in the most welcoming, friendly, and food bearing way I could have ever wanted to be lured into a new establishment! Our sample was phenomenal, so we took some advice from Mike & ended up with two full trays! 4 THUMBS UP! MIKE MADE THE ENTIRE EXPERIENCE (& the chicken was great too!)
