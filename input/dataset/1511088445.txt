I like coming to this Safeway because the prices are cheaper then other grocery stores in town. I think they are cheaper then Walmart. :)  The staff is really friendly and are realy helpful too.     So,  if you are ever in Mid-Town and are looking for a grocery store to go to.  You should head over to Safeway.
