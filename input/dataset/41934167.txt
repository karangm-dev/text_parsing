I used to frequent Maya often, as the Japanese stylists were sweet and skilled; however, I cannot justify patronizing a salon with such poor management and service any longer. My main issue is with the individuals who run the place. Time and time again, my appointment times have not been honoured, and they were rude and condescending when I last broached the topic with them. This was the straw that broke the camel's back, and I will not be giving Maya the satisfaction of wasting my time anymore.
