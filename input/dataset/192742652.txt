Awesome almond croissants and kouign amann. The kouign amann was a little heavy for me but stillDelicious. I luckily got a piece of a fresh baked one and hot and flakey. The sugar on top crystallized and was a nice touch. The almond croissant was just as good as Mamie clafoutis so I can't rly say which one is better.
