OK, this is definitely my first review of a gas station, but I thought I would add on to the other negative reviews.I don't know what the story is at this place, but they have an amazingly high traffic, convenient location and they waste it.  Many times, I have pulled in and they have been OUT OF GAS!  It is a gas station, so I think it is pretty important that they keep some gasoline in stock.  Also, if you go inside, they don't really keep anything else in stock either.
