I stumbled across this quaint nail salon  in desperate search of a mani/pedi and was amazingly surprised. Super cute boutique style nail shop with an airy beach aura, I immediately fell in love! I was greeted as soon as I walked through the door unlike many of the nail salons in the area. Another highlight was that the staff was engaged with clientele! A big hit was them speaking English in front of the clients and not just  speaking over you as if you're not there or talking about you while servicing you. Drinks and snacks are complimentary which they offer to all guest. My experience was A+!!! The best part is my nails look amazing...I'll definitely be back! Awesome service!!!
