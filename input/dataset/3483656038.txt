Obscenely expensive and over flavored. I was so looking forward to getting good macarons but was very disappointed. I had the honey lavender, rose lychee, creme Brule and caramel crunch. They were too cold and chewy, and the flavors were so strong it tasted like I was eating a bath bomb. I spent over 12 dollars only to discover they were nothing like the macarons I had grown to know and love. Will not return.  At least the service was friendly.
