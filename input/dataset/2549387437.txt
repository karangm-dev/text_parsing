We chose this place to split lunch and it was an excellent choice. Waiter was very enthusiast and funny. Had a good beer selection (mostly bottles) which was refreshing after much walking. BLT fried green tomato appetizer is a must have. We split the blue plate for our meal. Watermelon was tasty, chicken as well. Chicken wasn't anything special for me, but I am by no means a fried chicken expert. Only downfall was restaurant was a bit dark for lunch.
