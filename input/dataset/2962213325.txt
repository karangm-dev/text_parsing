This was a first for me.   Only two people at the bar but we couldn't sit there because there was still plates and glasses from previous customers lined throughout the almost empty bar.   It was a disorganized mess.   Ordered an appetizer and left.  Another customer came and sat at a high top and left shortly after for lack of service.   It felt like no one was managing and nobody cared. Can't comment on food because we never ordered due to the lack of service.
