My husband and I were looking for a place to eat. We decided to stop by Roberto's and try it out. For $27 we got one shrimp and one fish burrito and combo # 17 which is Diablo skimp with beans, rice, lettuce and tomato on the plate with a side of two tortilla. The tortillas were home made and simply delicious. They have a hot sauce, cucumbers and carrot and jalape√±os bar. Even though the food was almost $30 it was worth every penny and to be honest we barely finished our food.  Apart from all of the above, the bathroom was out of soap, so bring your own soup .
