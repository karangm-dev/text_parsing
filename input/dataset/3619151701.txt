Have been here a couple times.  If you like Mongolian this is a great place.  Drinks were good, service excellent, and the food selection area - which is important to me - was very clean!  HuHot keeps the meats frozen so raw juices do not get all over the place.  That is VERY smart.  Their selection is huge, and the sauces plentiful and good.  Last time we went my vegtarian frined was worried, but they cleaned a space on the grill stone, cooked her meal in a vegetarian pan, and used separate spatulas, so this place is vegetarian friendly.  Both times, good meals.  Looking forward to going back.
