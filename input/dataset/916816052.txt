My husband, friend and I finally made it in to Abugida for lunch this past Saturday. It's a great lunch spot! Warm, helpful and friendly staff welcome you into thier "home". The converted home is the restaurant. It sort of reminded me of the layout of Copper but there is a small kitchen area in the corner where coffee is made/served. There is an area where the coffee service is performed as well. It was warm out so we all got water and two if us got the veggie combo and my husband got the meat one. The meat combo is the veggie combo but then they come out with a hard-boiled egg and braised chicken and a spicy chili sauce that they add to the veggie platter. The veggies are not spicy as in hot but they certainly taste delicious and they bring you all the injera to scoop it up with that your heart could desire!The cook/owner came out after our meal was done and asked how everything was and she had said she hadn't done any marketing yet and this was all word-of-mouth and yelp. Go visit!
