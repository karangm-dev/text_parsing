This place is great!  My friends and I went to Vegas last year and were looking for some food after our flight. We wandered the strip and came across fat burger. It was great. I can't remember exactly what we ordered but I do remember the milk shake was fantastic and I was sad we didn't get a chance to go back again before we left. I was also sad to learn there are no fat burgers by me. If you are in Vegas and looking for a good burger, go here.
