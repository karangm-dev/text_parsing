The service as well as the lead manager Adam was horrible to me an the people dining.  We sat down and instead of welcoming us to Fern, he was abrasive and immediately stated "we need this table in 20" and left.  The couple next to us was appalled.  We love Something Classic and really respect The owner. We also understand sometimes the talent hired isn't a good as once thought.My family owns restaurants and service is everything I have already shared our horrible experience and solely base this on our experience with the staff.  Friends have shared the same and will be posting and not returning
