Wow, really enjoyed this place, so much that we went back to back days on our trip to Vegas.The bagels were some of the best I've had and the cheddar jalape√±o smear was just superb. Also had the scallion smear which was also amazing.The bakery section just all looked fantastic and can't wait to go back!
