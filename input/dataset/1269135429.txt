NEW CHEF!We had been visitors before the remodel some years back and never made a visit to the remodeled El Chorro. While I miss the funky d√©cor of old Scottsdale, I like the updated version also! We visited on a very chilly night and after a drink at the bar, my husband suggested we have our early dinner outside on the patio under all the heaters. I scoffed. It's really cold. The hostess suggested blankets. So she pulled out cozy blankets to cover our chilly laps! After sitting at our intimate table underneath the heaters, I really didn't need it and enjoyed the moonlit sky.Our server was Andre and he was great! Attentive and friendly without being too chatty. My husband had the sea bass and I had the pork tenderloin. We also had the wedge salad. Sticky buns yummy as always! Our food was moist, delicious and perfectly cooked. Soooo happy! Only complaint was that our wedge salad (which Andre had divided into two for us) had too much dressing on it.Second complaint was that the food was so good, I overate. My pooch is sticking out as I write.In our conversation, Andre mentioned that there was a new chef in the kitchen when we said how great our food was. Strongly recommend El Chorro.
