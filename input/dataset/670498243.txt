I am the guy who thought it would be a great idea to install an Appradio in my car myself. Everything went well, except I didn't have any sound. That's a small feature that I think is necessary in every car stereo install! lolI went here and was very impressed. They were able to fix my stereo so I finally have sound. They also installed the antenna for the navigation and the microphone for the phone. Also, the brackets I bought did not center the unit on the face of the dash. I told them about this and they were able to center everything. Everything was done clean and professional. The price was reasonable and I couldn't be happier.Carlos, the owner, even spent an extra 20 minutes after the install explaining to me how the app radio works and telling me about different types of speakers when I asked. I could tell he is very passionate about his business and car audio. Thanks again for everything DC Sound, I am glad to be listening to music again while driving!
