NOT MY BEST EXPERIENCE AT HAMPTON INN:   Noisy, Noisy, Noisy.... you could hear every door on the floor open and close... when you flushed the toilet, you would think a Hurricane was whipping through the room and the pillows, well let's just say they didn't offer much comfort.  Usually am pretty pleased with Hampton's but this one rates VERY LOW on the Totem Pole.
