After walking up and down Stephen ave to find a place to have lunch with my friend we finally decided on Original Joes.  We were greeted at the door by our server and the hostess, and picked a table in the dining room.  The server came over with menus as we sat down and immediately asked for our ID's.  My friend is 37 and I'm 28 and neither look underage in any way.  I informed her that neither of us would be drinking today and we were just here for some burgers.  She insisted on seeing our ID's and my friend gave the server his, however after searching for mine realized I didn't have it with me (didn't think I'd need it to order a burger and potato salad at 1pm on a Wednesday). At this point we were asked to leave and told we could not be in the restaurant even if we were not drinking and/or were not sitting on the bar side of the restaurant, unless we had ID with us.  I was flabbergasted and we got up and left, hungry and pissed off.  Since when is this the case?  I've seen many families and younger looking people eating happily in the restaurant side (back end) of original joes, in many cities.  To the best of my knowledge this is not a minors prohibited restaurant so even if i was 17 I should have been able to sit down and eat.   I can understand asking for ID if i was trying to get a drink or had already been drinking that day, but having to have ID to get a burger in a family restaurant at lunch time is a bit extreme.
