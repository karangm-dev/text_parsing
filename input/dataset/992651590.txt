Amazing!!!!  We live 5 minutes away and pass by it every day but had never tried.  Well I can't believe it took me so long.  I had the vegetarian mushroom risotto, delicious.  Very extensive wine selection as well as a great selections of beers.  Very intimate place, not very big but very nice.  Like the open kitchen aspect.  Will definitely be returning!
