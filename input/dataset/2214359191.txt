This is a gamer's Dream come true. They have hard to find collectibles (Nintendo, Anime, Sega, Xbox).The new selection is what you would expect from any game store, they have promotions sometimes.The used selections are pretty good but it changes fast. The staff is pretty sweet, there is this really chill older lady that runs it. She knows a lot about games which is something I was not expecting. My wife and I were buying a bunch of used starwars games and the staff at the time threw in a free game. So we love that place. Worth the drive at least once.
