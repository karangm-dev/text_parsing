Husband and I stopped in for an early lunch.  There were about 5 customers.  As we walked in, there wad a couple placing their order.  As soon as they finished, we stepped forward to order.  The girl who had been taking orders said she would be right with us and proceeded to walk about 4 feet and started slicing avocados.  Then she proceeds to stop what she was doing and decided to have a conversation with another co-worker.  Another employee walked over to where we were standing and decided that was her cue to lean on the counter and draw hearts on a piece of paper.  I asked if she could please take our order but was completely ignored.  We decided at that point we would go somewhere else.  We have been regular customers at this location since moving to AZ last year.  Horrible customer service.  Never again.
