Let's start with the customer service.  Or lack there of.  The people at the ticket sale booth are almost non-existent now, with them opting to use self-serve kiosks instead.  I can't help but notice they were installed right after minimum wage went up too.  I guess that's one way to drop both costs AND customer service.My last VIP experience was rather sub par too.  I'm guessing the cleaning crew were running late so we were let into the theatre a little late.  Which is fine, but holy, there were WAY too few people taking orders.  My group of five were literally getting our orders taken when commercials started and didn't get them until after the film started.  Wouldn't have hurt to push the film back five to ten minutes, would it?I know everyone hates commercials, but can we leave out the random Asian commercials?  Like seriously.  They show Asian movies at the theatre (which I think is a neat concept for that audience) so leave them for those.I've still had very few problems with the regular films, but if this weren't easily the most convenient location to watch VIP films, I'd consider going elsewhere.
