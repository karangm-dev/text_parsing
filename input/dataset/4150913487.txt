I selected Flores Family Dental after a recommendation from a friend. I went in and was able to make an appointment fairly quickly. I was greeted very nicely, the office was clean and everyone was very friendly and professional. My hygenaist Jaycee was super nice, so was the dental tech and Dr. Flores. I'm a former dental tech so I'm extra picky when it comes to dental offices and treatment. And no, I did not disclose this information with them. All in all I had a great experience. Everyone works very well together. I was particularly impressed that their office manager was out on an emergency and Dr. Flores processed my insurance and payment information and the tech helped make my next appointment. I love places where you can tell people enjoy what they are doing and they do it well. I'm making my husband switch to them...lol
