I really don't understand how this place has so many good reviews. I went here based off of the good reviews but, they don't listen to a word you say and messed up my order 3 times. I said fish they gave me shrimp. I asked for carne asada style fries without meat and they gave me something completely covered in veggies when I specifically told them 3 times I don't want veggies and explained exactly what I wanted on it. Their self serve hot sauce has no lids for take out and looks disgusting - they don't clean it. On top of it, the food wasn't even that good. Definitely never coming back.
