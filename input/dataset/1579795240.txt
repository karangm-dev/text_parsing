Think Spanish tapas, but with an Asian twist.  Then think a handful of traditional cocktails, but made with very high quality sake instead of vodka or gin.  Then think of genuine aloha spirit, and you have 808 Tapas.  Great concept, great food, great place to eat, drink and socialize.  Been here twice (once on the grand opening and again right afterwards) and ate different things each time and each thing I ate was damn delicious.  The menu is extensive and has many choices for a wide variety of tastes.  Go and give it a try.  Location is great - watch a movie and walk down to 808 Tapas afterwards instead of spending $37 on a soda, popcorn and Bon Bons.  I will definitely be a regular.
