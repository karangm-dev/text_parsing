Our hotel had complimentary shuttle service to anywhere in the city so on our first night we hopped in and said "take us down to the strip district, we just want to find a restaurant."  He said "you don't want to go to the strip district, you want station square!"  Coming from a native who drives visitors to places for a living we could not ignore his advice so to Station Square we went.Station Square is like that really sad airport mall, where to get a lease you have to say you will keep your shop open 24 hours a day, even though you know that although planes are coming and going no one is really in the market for socks or clever shirts about the destination at 3 AM.  We went at 5 o'clock 27 days from Christmas and were the only people in the mall minus the people working at the stores.  I am not exaggerating.  It was sort of eerie.  Even the restaurants were completely empty.  We took the incline up and got a good look of the city at night.  Took the incline back down and called for a pick up. Surprised that we were returning to the hotel so soon the driver asked what happened.  "It just wasn't really what we were looking for,"  I said.  "Well what are you looking for then?"  The driver said.  "I don't know really, I think we are just going to go back and get our car out of the garage and drive around a bit.  I think we might catch a movie."  At this point he mentioned there was a new Twilight movie out and that, assuming we had seen the other ones so we wouldn't be lost, maybe we would enjoy it.  If he would have opened with this suggestion we would have known to not trust him.  So although that part of our night was a bust, I learned the valuable lesson to temper hotel worker restaurant and nightlife questions with movie recommendation follow-ups.
