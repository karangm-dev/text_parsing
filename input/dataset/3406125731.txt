Crazy good.  Best cirque show yet!  The music was well done and speakers in the headrests of the stadium seat helped drown out the lady singing along in the seat next to us.  Non stop dancing and so many costumes to look at it was hard to take it all in.  Beautiful acrobatics nicely choreographed to complement the Beatles tunes!  Well worth the price of admission.  This was the highlight of our Vegas week.
