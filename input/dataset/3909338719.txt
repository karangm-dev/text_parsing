Went with my mother who's vegan and we got the Lemongrass Tofu Banh Mí and Fried Tofu.The Banh Mí was perfectly toasted, full of crisp carrots, cilantro and well seasoned tofu. The fried tofu was golden and crisp in the outside and soft in the inside. With the Thai Chili Sauces and Sriracha in the restaurant one can heighten the spice as desired. Had a great time and will definetly be back, oh and she got a passion fruit tea with chia and boba and I got the Thai tea with boba, both were awesome as well.
