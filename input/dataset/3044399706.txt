My girlfriend and I discovered this place late one night and it is one of our favorite spots in Vegas now! We try and get something new every time, which is kind of scary because the food from each previous visit is so good that we are afraid the new item isn't going to be as delicious...but nope. Everything on the menu is amazing!The panang duck is incredible and if you want to save some money, you can get chicken or steak instead of duck and it's super cheap. Like $9!  The Moo Hong (Black Pepper Pork Belly) is one of our favorites!The larb is much better than Lotus of Siam, in my opinion.The drunken noodles and pad Thai are excellent too!Everything is really really good and the prices are shockingly cheap compared to other Thai restaurants we've been to.Then there's the service. It was always good before, but after introducing myself to Chloe and Gap after the third visit, they've been even more friendly and amazing. Before, the service was 10/10, but now that I know the staff, I feel like family every time I walk in!  Service is STUPENDOUS now!  3,892/10!  Is that a realistic score?  Yes...yes it is.
