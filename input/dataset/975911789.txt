The place I work is very close by, so I find myself here often.  The servers and bartenders couldn't be more sweet!  The kitchen is usually pretty lenient on substitutes and the dishes are consistent.  I've found, personally, that some of the food is definitely better than other dishes, but have never had anything flat out BAD.  The bathrooms are clean, there is plenty of floor space (super ada friendly), and the outdoor seating is nice.  Bring your dog!
