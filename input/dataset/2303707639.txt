I have interacted with Peter Goldstein and his office for the past several years. He handles police brutality, misconduct and wrongful death cases like no other. He is compassionate about his representation and his clients. I send all referrals in this area to him and I have never received any negative feedback back. He is honest, sincere and dedicated to pursuing claims against law enforcement when they step out of line!
