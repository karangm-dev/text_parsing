This place is the best. Quick service, delicious food, and friendly staff. I have been a customer since the day I moved into the neighborhood and I still can't get enough. I love the authenticity of the preparation and the laid back vibe in the place. I have absolutely no complaints. This is consistent NY style goodness! Perfect for the family or a casual date night.
