It's like dating someone really pretty with no substance. Attractive on the outside, but super disappointing on the inside. Service sucks- super slow, rude and did I mention they're super slow? The food and drinks were decent when we finally got them, but not enough to bring me back. We had to walk up to the register to pay our check, then we walked over to CPK where they had excellent, friendly and attentive service. Take notes, Public School.
