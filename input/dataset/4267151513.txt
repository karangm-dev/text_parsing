Great food and atmosphere.  I visited this place twice while in Vegas.  I would have eaten here everyday of my 4 day visit but didn't think it was cool to do that to my companion. The Al.Carbon steak in any of.it's dishes are worth trying.  I had there steak nachos and Green Chili Smother Burrito.  Freakin awesome.
