Food came out at room temperature. We were the first there on a Saturday and expected fairly fast service. The flavor in the Tacos was good but nothing on the plate was hot. The food temp seemed like it was sitting for awhile. I'm not sure what is going on with Hot Taco in regards to food not coming out hot. The service was great and our waitress was excellent, but the food not being HOT really disappointed us. The manager came out and apologized. He also took care of the bill. I want to give them a second chance but it seems others have been since our visit so I'm apprehensive. I think this place would be great for drinking but not eating. Kinda sad since there are so many great options for dinning in this area and I hoped finally we would get a great place for Tacos. I guess we will wait and see if the reviews become positive before visitng again.
