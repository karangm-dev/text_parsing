I went to Vegas for my best friends birthday and we decided to make Sugar Factory the birthday breakfast.  There were 3 of us and we each got something different. I had the Strawberry Brioche French Toast with a scoop of ice cream, she got the Apple Pie Waffle and he got Red Velvet Pancakes. Re-read this last sentence so your mouth can water once again. The food here was delicious and the service was great. We even stopped in next door at their candy shop for some sweet treats for the room for the rest of our visit.
