I've been here 10+ times now and each time the service has been excellent. They have slowed down a little since the grand opening like most places do which to me has only allowed them to improve.  I will continue to frequent this convenient location. The quality of the food is still great and there's nothing hidden about how it's prepared. While you wait in line to order you can view openly where they prepare the food, so you know it's clean and up to standards. No complaints here!
