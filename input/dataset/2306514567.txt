I had a great experience here. I've been to a lot of different threading places all over the country as well as in bigger cities than Charlotte and this is no worse. I had Kimi and she did such a great job! I am always terrified of going to a new place, but happened to be in the area so this was convenient for me. I'll certainly be going back! Kimi was also so sweet to chat with and completely understanding of what I was looking for!
