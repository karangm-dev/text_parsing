My wife was so distraught after our meal @ Rotanas and wanted to do her nails! As a husband I don't usually pay attention to the details of nails but she was so pleased and the staff were great friendly and fast! Her nails look stunning!! To bad you guys have such a horrible restaurant next door because my wife will be back for her nails again! Great work!
