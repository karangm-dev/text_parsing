After a long very hot long day we came into grab some food stoned and really hungry.John was working the register. I ordered a salad for myself- the berry one. I also saw Mac and cheese on the menu.  I asked John if it was good.  He promised me it was and told me it was his favorite.  I asked him if he's just saying that because he works there.  He promised me it was really that good and told me to have my bf try it too and see what he thinks.We didn't dine in.  The berry salad I had was the best salad I've had in a long time.  Rarely do places like this have good salad but the ingredients were all super fresh, good proportions of everything, plenty of berries.  Definitely going to come back for it.The Mac and cheese though, that shit was dank.  It was like the dankest of the dank!  Josh, thanks for the suggestion.  Shit was delicious.
