Jewel's Bakery is surprisingly amazing. I was looking for gluten-free options thinking I would pick up a small pastry, but ended up eating the French Toast on the breakfast menu. It was not a traditional French Toast with generic sliced bread, but almost a cinnamon roll type consistency that was small and satisfying. And whatever syrup they give you is absolutely the best syrup you've ever tasted. Add in some slightly browned potatoes and nicely cooked bacon, and you've got one of the most satisfying breakfasts I've had in a long time in Phoenix.Be prepared to wait for your food. It seems like quality is preferred over quickness here. And let's be honest if you're out to breakfast why not enjoy the experience for as long as possible.The Pumpkin Spiced Latte was excellent as well. Homemade syrup that was flavorful without seeming chemically. If you're in the area skip LGO and head to Jewel's Bakery instead!
