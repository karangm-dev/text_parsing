I really wish I could give this place a better review but I'm so frustrated with this location. I come here every Saturday after working out because I love their coffee. Today it took over 30 minutes to order and get a bagel with cream cheese. They always have so many employees, but it never looks like any of them are doing anything. This happens every Saturday. My friend that goes with me always gets the wrong order. This location is just disorganized and it always seems like such a cluster behind the counter. I wish they'd get their act together.
