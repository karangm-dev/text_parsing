Wow.After being gone over a year I get a call for my appointment next week. Huh? I call the office, wait for 5 minutes on hold, hang up and push the billing button, someone picks up immediately (I guessed billing would answer at this office). The lady in billing was VERY nice I must say and apologized, she said the office schedules a physical every year in advanced for you, how kind. What a great way to make money - my wife got the same call and hasn't been a patient for longer than I. So had we not called to cancel, an appointment we never made we would have been charged a no show fee as indicated in the email I also received today. This is a deceptive practice - I sure hope people stop going there and whoever is running this place reconsiders their money making schemes.
