1st visit: I was greeted by Kyli and Jill both were very nice. I watched an information video. Kyli then proceeded to do a walk through of the site she was through and i found it very informative.I got into the pod  and relaxed for an hr,, my suggestion is to try and relax, if you can just let your body go into limp mode, IMO you will probably get the best results. Once I got out of the pod, I had some water and house tea, I also decided to also try the oxygen stations, I did that for about 15-20 min and it was nice and relaxing. I was shown the membership packages, but decided to hold off on them for now,  I would strongly recommend trying this if you have the any interest.
