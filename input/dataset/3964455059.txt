I don't really know anything about Chinese cuisine, however I thought this place was the real deal!  Well thought out interior, great open dining space. Our service by Eddie was terrific.  Eddie was kind enough to make several recommendations. The house three chili chicken was spectacular and they give you plenty of it to share.  I tried pork belly for the first time and while it was not my favorite dish it had a good flavor balanced with sweet veggies. They have  both an authentic Chinese menu and a Americanized Chinese menu with many options for picky eaters and children.  We will definitely go back in the future.
