I went to newport motors yesterday to buy a new car.  I bought 2 cars from them previously. They have a new staff now. The new manager there was awful no people skills what so ever.  He didn't speak when we 1st came in he just sent a new guy out to us who didn't know what he was doing. He had to go back and forth to the manager the whole time. Long story short. The manager didn't want to work with my daughter and I. He never came out of his corner. The old staff was great. No matter if they could help you or not they treated everyone with the best customer service. If you want to get a car from newport motors go to the new one on west Sahara. Avoid ( East Sahara ) like the plaque! !!!
