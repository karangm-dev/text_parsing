As a rental tenant and having to deal with this company as a third party, my experience has been HORRIBLE. Called in on Monday to the property manager to report our AC was out. Was called the next day for the electrician to set up an appoinment, (why not an AC tech on the first trip, when that's the issue I called in...) The electrician who showed up in a van that said HVAC/Electrical/etc... told me that the AC unit was the problem and not the electrical....(I knew that). He said that an AC tech would have to come back the next day. Wednesday I was supposed to get a call and they never called. Thursday, NHW called and said a tech was on his way, so I left work, got home and the tech was rude, unprofessional and did not know what he was doing, he figured out that the compressor was bad and would need to be replaced. Friday they sent a tech in the morning to clean to the coils to verify if they could replace the unit under warranty, Friday afternoon, they sent ANOTHER AC tech that verified that the unit would need to be replaced and would be done by Saturday. NO calls TUESDAY and finally had the unprofessional come back and spend the entire day to replace the compressor.... If they would have sent the AC tech the first day, I could have had the problem fixed by Thursday or Friday and been happy. I spent $300 at Lowes to get a portable AC unit and left work on 3 separate occasions.... This company needs to get their SH!* together.... I know when I buy a home that I WON'T be using this company for anything....
