"Captain" John and "Crewmen" Matt and Cameron were sent to help facilitate our move. From a 2000 sq ft 3 story home in Mountains Edge , to a 4000 sq ft 2 story home across town in Whitney ... My family and I knew it would be quite a task for just a normal moving day. Let's just say they completely stepped in and got it completed in less than 3 hours!! Our experience has left us feeling like we can only be "Faithful" to these guys and no one else!! Our first contact with Christopher Moving came after reading all the grand Yelp reviews, from that, I thought what could it hurt to add another "Great" review? From the first phone call to the wrap-up of the move;  I would like to say that our experience was definitely worth taking the time to write an additional review. Our "Captain" John came in right away to coordinate the move and route his crewmen in the right direction. They were PROMPT!, PROFESSIONAL! and were always On-The-Move! As much as I dread moving, Christopher Moving took all our worries away and left my family and I completely satisfied with our results. If anyone is looking for a great moving company with very reasonable rates, this is the place to call!
