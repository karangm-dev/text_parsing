I asked to come to this restaurant as we had dined here previously with our neighbors so what better place for a romantic Birthday with my honey. He had made the reservation and advised it was my birthday which he did as a surprise to me. The surprise was they forgot, some 50th birthday celebration that was. As we got up to leave they pulled my partner back in to apologize.  Too late then when I had already left.The food was really tasteful and arrived promptly, but the experience is not just the food, it is the whole evening. I am crossing this off my list of favorite places.
