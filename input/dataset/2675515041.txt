Some of the best/freshest Italian food I've ever had. Every bite was scrumptious. I appreciated that the menu was simple and straightforward, not too many choices but just enough to have options. My mom got the pappardelle which had the perfect blend of flavors and melt-in-your-mouth freshly made pasta. I had the Sonny Boy pizza and I really appreciated the fresh mozzarella - it was the perfect amount and really refreshing. Our food also came out quickly; they literally just whipped it up and sent it out. Can't wait to go back!
