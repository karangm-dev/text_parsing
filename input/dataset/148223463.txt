That was a short business trip to Phoenix in December and I got to stay at Palomar hotel just for one day and one night. I had a red-eye flight and couldn't sleep all night. And I was feeling sick.. with a sore throat. What could be worse to enjoy your hotel stay? When you get good memories out of such situation, that means hotel quality. Very.. very.. nice staff. The interior design is out of this planet. The chief architect is a man to look up to! Very very nice and comfortable rooms. Nothing fancy but the room sure made me feel like home and have a good sleep! Located in the heart of Phoenix downtown, which I got to discover and loved a lot. I felt sad when I was checking out.. that never happened to me before.
