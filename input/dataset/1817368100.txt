Would have been a 1 star except the great ambiance, lively band and wait staff (which was a bit slow) but helpful & friendly. This was my 2nd visit with 4 or more business associates. Both times we ordered the charcuterie (V95 board) appetizer and both times that was awesome.  This visit (2/28/15) I chose the flatiron steak as an entree.  It was the worst steak I can recall ever being served, I asked for med rare / med and it was a severely undercooked, sinewy excuse for a $30+ dollar piece of meat.  I wasn't sure whether to ask for the steak to be sent back or for a sharper steak knife to cut it! I won't send meals back though, I just don't return to the establishment - a plate at that price should be done right the first time.  To top it off - all the next day I had very "fluid" reminders that I shouldn't have forced myself to eat 1/3 of that steak. The wine and wine list were good & the duck the rest of my party had was as well. With tip the bill was  $200, which would have been fine had I been able to eat.  V95 as of yesterday does not off the flatiron (mis)steak on the menu, maybe they figured out its atrocious, I won't be back to confirm.
