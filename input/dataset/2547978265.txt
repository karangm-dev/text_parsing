WARNING...Absolutely Horrible experience. We had 20 people for a 50th birthday party. The first club we had to wait over an hour to get in. It was packed and not pleasant. We were rushed to the 2nd club. They were told everyone was beer drinkers and only had 10 beers for 25 people. They did not even have water for the non drinkers. We were turned away at the 2nd club that was too packed. They wanted to take us to a replacement club which would have been fine if the bus was there to take us. Over an hour and a half of standing around and still no bus. I felt bad for my sister, it was her birthday and a bust! They refused any refunds. I am trying my credit card company and will write reviews to give people a heads up that THEY DON"T CARE about the client.. It is all about scamming the money from out of towners.
