WORST company ever.  You'll be put on a horrible phone tree, which will get you to the wrong department, that department will try and 'upsale' you before finally transferring you and then pow - you get your bill and surprise - it's wrong.  When you call about being overcharged you will be given the same number to call to 'reduce' your service and the hours you can call will be truncated because you are not a 'loyalty' customer so you keep having to call back - just to get back to the service you originally signed up for.  It's like dealing with the horrible combination of a used car salesman and an insurance salesman all at once.
