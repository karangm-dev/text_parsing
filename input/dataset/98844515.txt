I am probably cutting my nose off despite my face but something needs to be done about the "LACK of CUSTOMER SERVICE" provided by this business.  My wife and are looking to purchase a modular home located in this community.  We worked and agreed on a unit and then submitted the application along with a $250 app fee.  I understand there are some cost involved in getting these reports but I paid it and moved forward.  We were approved without any problem and I am attempting to schedule a closing date and move in.  Well today, August 3rd I find out this community will not allow us to sign the lease or move in until I can deliver to them a copy of the title for the modular home with my wife and me listed as the owner.I can pay for the home start paying the insurance to cover the property but I cannot sign the lease and move in until the state of Ohio issues a title with my name in it?  In the state of Ohio that can take up to 30 days.  This is the CRAZIEST THING that I have ever heard!  I called and left a message asking the park manager to call me but I would bet a large amount of money that she will not return my call.  I start my job in the Cleveland area on 9-1-16 and I am not willing to pay to stay in a hotel if I just purchased a modular home and making payments on that unit.So I hope someone from Columbia Park or their parent company is paying attention to reviews and social media.  I hate to say it but if we cannot clear this up then I have to cancel the purchase of this home and look at another location.  The annual lot fee is over $6000 per year so this is a big item to me.  I will update this rating when I have more information.
