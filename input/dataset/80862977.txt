I used to go to the Bikkuri on king street quite often and really liked the sushi there. So the name stuck with me and when this place opened a few years ago I was happy there was another location. However the food wasn't great when I tried it before. The sushi wasn't great quality and there was a lot of rice. Yesterday I ordered take out from here because I was on the area and decided to give it another try to see if things improved. It hasn't. We ordered the sushi for two dinner and a salmon teriyaki. The sushi has a bit nicer presentation but the fish is sliced very thin and there is a lot of rice. Some of the fish seems not fresh. The salmon teriyaki was a good portion but the sides was two pieces of broccoli and two pieces of carrots. Based on my most recent experience not sure if I would come back for take out. Overall not memorable place for sushi takeout.
