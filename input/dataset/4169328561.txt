Absolutely the worst customer service center I have ever dealt with. The associate Sandra was condescending and very rude. As for the other associates. The one supervisor they had trying to look up the transaction didn't even communicate with me that they could not locate the transaction via the date and card number and just walked off. A gentleman by the name of Dave was the only positive experience. Listening to the conversations employees were having with themselves as well as the way they were treating other customers has definitely put me off from ever shopping here again. This place keeps getting worse.
