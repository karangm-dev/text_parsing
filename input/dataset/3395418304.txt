Just stumbled upon this place by chance on a Sunday morning. Long wait is usually a good sign. The food was excellent. Very creative spins on the usual stuff. I had the stuffed brioche French toast and my wife had the salmon omelet. Both were excellent and had so many side dishes we have enough leftovers for dinner!
