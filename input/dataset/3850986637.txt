Horrible service and staff, even after showing them my confirmation number for my reservation they didn't honor it, staff acted indifferent and cold because their hotel was booked full and they had no record of my reservation. Hotel searchers beware!!! Don't book this hotel, no reassurance you will even have a room when you arrive. Ruined my anniversary trip with my wife, had to stay in North Scottsdale and had to cancel dinner reservations we had for that night in Cave Creek. Not only did this hotel lose my business but they lost the business of my friends and family.
