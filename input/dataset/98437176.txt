Underwhelming- upscale interior, slightly-inflated regular prices on menu, nice range of seafood options. Since I was only doing takeout, I just made the cut for the lunch specials from 11AM-3PM (also valid on weekends!) and opted for the garlic chicken. Per the menu, lunch specials come with soup (when you dine in), salad, fried rice, and egg roll (I thought this was a Thai place?), with entrée protein choice of chicken, beef, or pork,  surcharge for shrimp. My dish was  one flavorless spring roll, a heap of wonton strips (who eats those except on soup?), and a chunk of ice berg lettuce with some matchstick carrots. And my (half?) portion of garlic chicken: lightly flavored sauce, tender chicken, and a good shake of pepper on top? Very odd. Oh and the "entrée" section of the takeout box was largely dominated by a gigantic heap of white rice. Not fried. This would be better placed where the wonton strips are.Service was quick and polite. Order did not meet my expectations. Did not eat half the order: won ton strips and dressing-less lettuce were tossed, could not stomach the flavorless spring roll or more than a few bites of the white rice that was hogging the space that should have been occupied by more garlic chicken.Likely would not come here again.
