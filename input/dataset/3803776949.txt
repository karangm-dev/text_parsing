Im going to be fair with the Dr and practitioner, both ladies are really nice, front desk could be nicer, and nurses assistant are really nice as well,i will not complain of them treating my son wrong, they were really nice, my biggest complaint is of how irresponsible and how unprofessional dr can be,hard to get an appointment with her, hardly ever around,so you get to see practicing, even you're pretty clear about who you want your baby to be seen. It's impolite to just turn away people when already in the same room , im changing because of this reason,and as a cash patient it's hard to be spending the money and time from work to work around the appointment they want to give you. I hope they pay close attention, as you will continue loosing patients.
