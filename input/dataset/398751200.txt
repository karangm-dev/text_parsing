I visited Upper Deck on a Saturday of Memorial day weekend during a UFC fight.  We were looking to watch the fight and there were tons of TVs and large tables upstairs so we got just what we were lookin for as far as the sports part goes.  As for the grill part, I'll cut them some slack for me having picked a busy night and weekend, but my drinks took a long time to get there and the second one was wrong.  I would have given a more favorable rating except that the food wasn't great either.  I ordered a philly cheesesteak with potato salad and some wings.  The wings were pretty good but the rest was kind of blah.
