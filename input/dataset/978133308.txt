I also give Maryann Mangan Lourenco from Farmers Insurance at 7501 W. Lake Mead Blvd 89128 a one, because a zero is not an option. I had all my business Insurance with her office, she delegated my commercial account to an unlicensed representative in her office. Unfortunately at NO fault of our own, we had a claim. We were misinformed by this unlicensed person directly from Maryann's office. ( Which Maryann authorized to handle our business account, we have all E-mails ).When we questioned Maryann about the we were cursed out and yelled at and hung up on. This misinformation delayed our claim and cost us thousands of dollars.Joe D. Feel free to contact me(702)204-7177
