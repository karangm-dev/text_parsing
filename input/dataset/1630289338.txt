Had dinner here with a couple of co workers and wow the service was the best! They bring chips and salsa out first with some kind of bean sauce that is AMAZING. I had the appetizer sampler which had quesadillas taquitos and nachos and it was so filling. We ordered the cheese quest bake that they have and would definitely recommend that as well. Our servers were so attentive and nice they really made the experience for us!
