My girlfriend and I are visiting Toronto from Edmonton and happened to stumble upon this trendy and upbeat Italian joint after spending the afternoon at the ROM.  From the outstanding and accommodating staff to the phenomenal food this restaurant deserves a 10/10.  We both loved everything about this place and intend to be back.  Thanks to Jean-Paul and the rest if the staff at Dimmi for making us feel like we were a part of the family.Sincerely,Mikal and Georgia
