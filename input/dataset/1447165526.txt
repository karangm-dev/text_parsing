My wife and I are expecting and trying to get the nursery together when we discovered that one of our dogs has been using the spare bedrooms as there personal potty rooms. We needed new carpet and fast!I found affordable flooring through yelp and went to the show room, we were in and out of there within 1 hour with carpet, padding and an install date set. We paid 1/3 the price that was quoted  by HD and Lowes.They came and installed the carpet yesterday and were on time, fast professional and clean!It was a pleasure doing business with Travis and his associates! I would definitely do business with them again before I go any where else!!!
