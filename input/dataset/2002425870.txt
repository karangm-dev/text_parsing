The two most important things that people should look for in a mechanic is honesty & skill. Sam is by far the most trustworthy and knowledgeable mechanic I know. I cannot tell you how grateful I am to have found him. He is the only mechanic that I will refer to others and he deserves all of the business he can get. His prices are more than fair, he finishes his work in a timely fashion, and he genuinely cares about his customers. I have gone through Sam several times and Caspian Auto is the only shop I will go to. His old shop was less than a mile from me which is how I found him, but now he is 8 miles from me and I still continue going to him. Honestly, he could move to Glendale and it wouldn't stop me. Give him a chance and I promise you will not be disappointed!!!Thank you for everything Sam!
