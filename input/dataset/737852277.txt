My original review was very positive I did enjoy my message from Breida. I am now glad I didn't right my review that day because I walked in healthy and nothing wrong now 24hr later I have pink eye. Of course they tell me I didn't get pink eye from there location but considering I went from my house to this location back to my house didn't leave afterwards. It's they only place where my eyes came in contact with anything. So disappointed
