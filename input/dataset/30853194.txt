I'm not that into the pool parties in Vegas, but Encore Beach Club is my favorite thus far.The pool is huge and I really like the setup of all the cabanas.  At many other pool parties, there is simply not enough room unless you have a cabana or daybed.  Since EBC is so large, I think it's possible to have a great time whether you have a cabana or not.Easy access to the bar, good music, and a fun ambiance make EBC stand apart from other pool parties.  Not the best place to sunbathe, but if you are looking to party, I think EBC is one of the best day clubs.
