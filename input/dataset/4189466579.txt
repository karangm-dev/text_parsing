Nice store..............terrible service.  Have visited this store twice.  First time I walked out because the line was too long and only 1 cashier.  This time, I had to have a particular item then waited past 20 minutes in a very long line while 1 cashier had to deal with the stress.  It took 15 minutes for the 2nd one to show up.  By that time I was so aggravated.   Will NEVER return.   There are just too many other stores and online sites to buy the same stull.   Either their manager is a moron or their corporate office is just a moronic for making them stick to a ridiculous budget.    Very stupid management either way
