This is hands down one of my favorite places in Mentor. Not only are the subs beyond tasty, but the owners really make customers feel welcome.I've been a customer at Dave's for about 6 months and everyone who works there knows us when we come in - they even know what substitutions to make on our subs!Prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is very hippy, chill. Be sure to sign the wall if you eat there!
