Love the breakfast here! Tastes like a home cooked meal.  Portions are huge! Usually have leftovers to take home, the prices are great, the servers are extremely friendly that give your great recommendations! Can't go wrong here for breakfast.  I pick this place over Denny's, ihop, and village in any day of the week!
