This was the second time we have shipped a car with DAS, and both times were super easy and efficient.  We were drawn to them by AAA and their recommendation, and they did not disappoint.  Timely and nice people we dealt with on both ends (shipped from the Dallas/Fort Worth area to So Cal/Orange County), and our car arrived to us in perfect condition.  A very good experience.  We are grateful for that, as moving can be nerve racking enough as it is.  DAS made the car shopping part a breeze!
