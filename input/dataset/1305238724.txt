Service- Horrible. We sat there for 10 minutes literally trying to flag someone down because they were too busy on their phones. Food- Dessert was alright, but like other reviewers have noted, a bit pricey for the portion you get. We ordered the black sesame, taro sago, fried milk custard and walnut dessert. Taro sago was definitely the best out of the four.In conclusion, nothing special and I probably wouldn't come again.
