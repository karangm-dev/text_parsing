Choose this Pharmacy because it's 24 hours I had gone to urgent care for 4 A.M. took their with my script in hand only to find out that the doctor had incorrectly written the dosage. The pharmacist on duty really impressed me because he had other customers the drive-thru going off he still managed to call the Urgent Care Center and get in touch with somebody to clarify my script and get me on my way and what I consider a very short amount of time.
