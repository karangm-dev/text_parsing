Had my eyebrows done here today and I am absolutely in love with this place. I lwave the country today and they were able to get me in last minute. It's so cute on the inside and everybody was soooo nice. Victoria did my brows and was such a sweetheart and did an amazing job. I had really bad experiences in the past with getting my eyebrows done at other places so I am so happy I came to this gem  I will definitely be back!
