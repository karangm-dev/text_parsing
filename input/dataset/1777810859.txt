GO NOW!!!There's a Groupon that's not good for much longer. If you can book one of the remaining time slots (yes, you may have to book a week or two out) for the groupon price then this is the best escape room value in the city.NextRelic is easily accessible off the highway and the room is excellent. The tech in this room is better than anywhere else in the city, both in quality and how well it's incorporated into the game. My group of 4 paid $50 total with the groupon and taxes. I'd recommend four in your group, unless you're inexperienced at these rooms in which case one or two more could be ok. The downsides are how tough the room is to book, since they only have one room and it only runs once every two hours. As well the theme is a little on the weak side with minimal back story given. Overall I'd say this is one of the top 5 rooms in the city in many aspects. It's very tech heavy, but it all worked and didn't cause any real frustrations. Even at the full price this place is definitely worth it, but try and get in for cheap while you can.
