Have to vent about this place.The food is fine.But if you ever book one of the private rooms at this place, be prepared if they give away your reservation to another group that they think is more important than you.We booked the large private room for our wedding rehearsal dinner 3 months in advance.  Then approximately 1 month before the date, the restaurant called and asked if we really needed the large room because another group wanted it and whether the small room would suffice.  I told the restaurant yes, we need the large room.The night before the wedding rehearsal dinner, we called them to confirm our reservation.  They told us that we were in the small room.  I then got into an argument with them about it and they apologized but said the group that wanted the large room were regulars.  Maybe that's how you do business in Korea, but that shouldn't be how you do it here in Canada. Anyway, we cancelled our booking, got a room at the other Seoul House (different owners) and have never been back to this one.
