Very impressed.  Very expensive. I am gluten intolerant. The chef came out of the kitchen and walked me around the entire buffet,  and showed me every item that was gluten free, non cross contaminated,  and even went to the back to provide me wh chicken soup prior to adding the noodles. A fresh gluten free pizza was made for me as well in the back. Thank you.
