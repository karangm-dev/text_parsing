My car was picked up from my home in Houston on Memorial Day, May 28, with an ETA in Minneapolis of June 11.  The car sat in Houston for a week and was then taken to Mesquite, where it sat for a week.  It then made it as far as Markham, IL. I was assured on a daily basis by "customer service" that is would be loaded that night.  It FINALLY left Markham (8 hours away) on June 17 and arrived in Minneapolis on the 18th.  I had paid to have it delivered but opted to pick it up because it wouldn't have been delivered till the next day!  I understand that the ETA is only an estimate, but they went 50% over the estimate and lied to me over and over.  I would have appreciated an honest answer.
