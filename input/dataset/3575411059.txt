Visited this place for the first time yesterday...office staff and Dr K were great!  We brought our 15 month old sheltie in for her shots and well check since we just moved back to the valley and needed a vet.  Dr K took a fair amount of time visiting with us answering all our questions and giving us what we felt was valuable and very informative information so that we could make decisions on whether we should do a particular medication or not.  It wasn't about up selling us, it was what is best for our dog.  Very comfortable that we have the right dr for our pet!
