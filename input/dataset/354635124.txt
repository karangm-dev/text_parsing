No complaints here. Fairly cheap for the overall quality of the place and service. Appointments aren't necessary BUT I suggest it. They were fairly dead when I got there but within the matter of minutes it became a full house of mani+pedi walkins.Alex is great, always kept asking if what he was doing looked okay.
