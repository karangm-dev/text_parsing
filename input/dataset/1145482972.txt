I happened across Laser Away while walking around Scottsdale Quarter. I have been dealing with scarring from cystic acne for years, but due to where I live (northern AZ), options for scar removal are limited or non-existent. I made an appointment and upon consultation, was presented with several options that suited my needs. I opted for a package deal that while upfront was more expensive, actually broke down to being cheaper. I am getting Clear and Brilliant for my scars, highly recommended (I am a "seasoned" veteran when it comes to lasers). I would also like to acknowledge James for his hospitality and always accommodating my needs. I make a 4.5 hour drive just to come here, it's absolutely worth it. Thank you, Laser Away, for being open on weekends so I can actually not miss work and make the trip. The road to rebuilding my self confidence started here! :)
