DO NOT PURCHASE A PREPAID DETAIL FROM THIS LOCATION. Took my vehicle here for a car wash and salesman was pushing a detail package which I explained that I did not have the time to sit for two hours and wait for my vehicle. He reassured me that they are really slow right now because of the monsoon and I could bring my vehicle back anytime if I were to prepay the detail that day. I agreed and the next Saturday called at 2:30 pm (They close at 6pm) to see if there was time for me to bring my car in just to be on the safe side. The person that answered the phone said they were no longer accepting prepaid customers for that day. I explained that the sales rep said I could bring it back anytime and asked if it would be best that I bring it back next Saturday morning.  She explained that I could but I would have to leave my vehicle there all day because I prepaid. I asked if I could then schedule an appointment and she said no that it was first come first serve for prepaid customers. So basically if I were to drive down there right now and buy a new detail package they would be able to get it done but since they already took my money they are treating me as if I am less than the customer that does not prepay. I usually only write positive reviews on Yelp and if I have had a negative experience I try to give the business the benefit of doubt but after reading other negative reviews involving the same bad business practice I feel the consumer needs to be warned.
