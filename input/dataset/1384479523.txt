I am sitting at this doctor right now ... All we need is a prescription refill ... I have not been treated nice, the lady in the front doesn't know very much and I have been waiting for 1 and a 1/2 hours ... Absolutely ridiculous ... This is not a place for people who actually have a life ... They want you to spend it here in their four ugly walls . I would not recommend coming here if u don't have all day time ... This sucksUpdate: so then the last time the doc said next time when u need a refill it should go very fast.  So now we need a refill, guess what, the lady in the front is a total bitch, I mean so unfriendly ... Unbelievable ... And Dr. Josh lied. Now we are stuck again ... This sucks ... But avoid this doctor's office if u can ... Absolutely horroible !
