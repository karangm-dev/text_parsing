Reed Pirain.. in my opinion,  is a unprofessional and rude realtor at PPM. His conduct responding to a request for information regarding one of "his own listings" was un-cooperative and rude.I called him because he was the listing agent and my buyer  agent was out of town and unavailable. I was planning on making an offer. I wanted to  validate the HOA fees and a few questions about the bylaws. I needed "only" the phone number of the POC for the community association that he had as listing agent. I called him and left him my number and the info I needed. He called me back and said to call my agent for the info and that he didn't work for me. I explained that my agent was out of town and regardless  did NOT have that info only the listing agent had it.  He was resistant to giving me any info on his own listing. I told him I needed the info to make "an offer" for his own listing. After much back and forth he finally gave me the number. He basically didn't want to cooperate and was completely disinterested in providing any further info on his listing which I was trying to make an offer on.The most unprofessional Realtor that I ever encountered. Do yourself a favor stay away from Reed Pirain of PPM Realty. BTW, His listing had a number of untruths and it showed his limited knowledge of basic info about property. Data such as HOA fees, laundry facility, storage area, capital contributions, incomplete seller disclosure and unknown occupancy of unit. Sloppy listing with plenty of errors and misrepresenting the property and his client. Believe it or not he is the President of Pittsburgh Realtor board of directors. He is an embarrassment to the Pittsburgh Board of realtors.I am sure the Pa Board of Realtors will want to know about his unprofessional conduct and they will.
