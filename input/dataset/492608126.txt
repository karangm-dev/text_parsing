So I'm only giving this hotel an extra star because of the customer service I received from Alicia. I'm one that takes reviews into consideration but I also like to come up with my own. Arriving at the hotel it seemed nice. Slightly run down but nothing to bad. Upon entering the room was a different story. Immediately when we went into our room it smelled like sh*t literally. The ac unit on the wall only made it worse blowing out warm air. The carpet was dingy, the sunken tub was filthy and there were burn marks everywhere from the room to the restroom counter. Even though they advertise non smoking can't blame them for stupid people making breaking the rules. Within the first 5 minutes I honestly had to vomit from the smell and did. We immediately went back to the front desk and let Alicia know that we just couldn't stay. She was very apologetic and helpful and let me know that if I notified groupon for a refund she would honor it. So thank you Alicia for your customer service. If rumor can get the cleanliness in tact with the customer service that Alicia gave their profit and customer feedback can improve.
