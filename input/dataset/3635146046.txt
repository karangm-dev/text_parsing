No complaints about the staff. The main problem seems to be their system, or process.  I reserved a car online days in advance and showed up to get it on time. When I reached the front of the line, which took over 10 minutes, the clerk told me that she would have to call for my car. This took about five minutes in itself. Why do they have to call on the telephone for a car that I already reserved when I show up on time?In all, the process at the rental car desk, with waiting combined with processing me, took over 20 minutes. This is way too long.
