After moving to Charlotte, there was one common refrain that I constantly heard: "You need to go to Cantina 1511.  It is excellent."Well, I went.  And it was far from excellent.The food itself was good, but it was not outrageously delicious as I had been promised.  The food was just as good as at any standard Mexican restaurant.  Everything else, however, was far different.Despite having a reservation, we waited for almost an hour to be seated.  There was a huge crowd of people in the waiting area, so the wait was uncomfortable.  Also, the bar was so crowded that it would have been very difficult to get a drink for the wait.  And the huge crowd also magnified the inadequacy of their parking.The atmosphere was nice, definitely a step up from a standard Mexican restaurant.  However, you pay for that step up, and pay dearly.  Unfortunately, I can't remember any specifics, but everything was expensive.  I doubt anyone could get out for under $15 unless they skipped the drink, appetizers and desert.  The guacamole is allegedly great, but I am not a guac fan, so I passed.  The drinks are also very expensive.  A pitcher of mojito went for north of $60, as I recall.In summary, the food was good.  I have since gone to a wedding reception that they catered, and it was great.  But the wait and the prices make Cantina a poor choice in my book.  There must be plenty of people that disagree, though, based on how busy it was.  Cantina is a place to see and be seen, not to get good food for reasonable prices.
