I picked this airline because they have good pricing and they offer alot of benefits to the military. Well wi that said I am very upset with them. My fkight was supposed to take off at 0700 and it is now 1146. First they move gates, then the plane they move us too has a flat tire, which they find on a preflight inspection 20min before boarding? I'm in the airforce, we complete these checks at least 2hrs prior to flight. Then the Nav CDU craps out then they get an engine indication light. They remove and board us 3 times then ground the plane. They still dont know when or if we will get a flight out. They give us meal vouchers to use in airport, of after you get your voucher it says in the fine print that by accpeting the voucher you cant lay anymore claim to the airline. Fooled you. This airline is a joke, their planes are garbage and in top of everything else I missed my grandmother's funeral. Thanks
