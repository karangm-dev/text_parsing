Came here on a date. I absolutely LOVE the atmosphere. The bartender was super nice and entertaining. The drinks were VERY good (I had about 4 of the Peach on Peach drinks from the happy hour menu). The calamari appetizer was pretty good...I'm not the biggest fan of calamari, my date ordered it so if you like calamari definitely GO FOR IT!! My entree was the Bone in ribeye... It was DELICIOUS! It needed a little more salt but it was cooked perfectly! The asparagus was cooked PERFECTLY as well! The risotto was ok but needed some salt... I liked the cheesiness of it tho. Overall great place, good food, WONDERFUL staff!!!
