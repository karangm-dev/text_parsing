I have been to many nail salons in Chandler, Mesa and Tempe, by far Award Nails is the BEST place and I have continued to return for years. The staff is professional,  friendly,  creative, and will keep you satisfied.  The salon is clean, welcoming and recently upgraded with current decor and paint. The cost is reasonable and affordable!  They have many nail designs to pick from or you can bring your own and they will  duplicate it. Everytime I'm out in public I get compliments on my nails, and definitely refer them to Award Nails. Anyone in salon can help you,  but my preference in techs are Amy and Ryan.  Please see the collage of pictures I have posted of just a few nail desings.
