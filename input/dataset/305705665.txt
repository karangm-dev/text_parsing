Soho is always delicious, a great alternative to sushi prices.  Think of it as a giant sushi roll or handroll.  I always customize mine, start with the Triple S, no jalapeno & no chipotle mayo.I add sesame soy sauce, add ahi tuna, add green onions, and everything else it comes with is ok.  Some extra sesame soy sauce on the side so the burrito doesn't get mushie.  The staff is friendly and clean place.
