Called & talked to Lee in commercial about replacing or repairing a rollup door on a commercial bulding. He laughed at me & said by the time he gets a quote done he could already have the work done. I then told him my company requires a couple quotes submitted prior to getting any work done. He then said rudely "call them, they will screw you good". I said thanks & hung up. They only want easy sales & not put any efffort in. Ironically, i had a garage door installed at my house a couple years ago by overhead door. They won't be getting my business in the future.
