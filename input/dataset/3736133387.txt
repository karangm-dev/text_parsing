It was OK.  I am really glad I got a heck of a deal on livingsocial, or I would have complained about the prices.  We had a total of 4 actors, everything else is filmed.  The actors are good, and to their credit they do know a little about the geography of the country, interacting knowledgeably about the area we a were from.  I will say they stayed in character regardless of the situation.  You have to read a lot, which is not good for kids under 13.  They start the videos before you get done reading.  It isn't well timed.  People were right on our heels.  There's not a lot for kids to do once you get past the initial 5 minutes of the skit.  It's a bit of looking at artifacts, which is boring.  My husband and I would have read the displays more thoroughly if they had something for the kids to do.  Overpriced merchandise at the end, as always.  LIVINGSOCIAL has a better deal than Yelp when I bought the tickets.
