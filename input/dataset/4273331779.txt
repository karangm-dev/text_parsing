I had to wait 45 min for my car. Then the one I got smelled like ashtray so I requested another car. The car was really good, worked perfectly, no complaints there. Access yo shuttle is not good. Place is not with all other car rentals companies, about 5 min away. The price was competitive but for inconvenience it is not worth it to me. I doubt I will use it in the future.
