Today, I had a horrible experience with Professional Clean Carpets and Vents!The carpet tech, Joey, gave me a price to clean my stairs and hall and I agreed to get them cleaned.  After he cleaned my first room, my family room, I felt how saturated with water my family room carpet was when I stepped on it.  I told him I did not want the stairs, hall or even the rooms on my Living Social voucher cleaned.  I said that I was going to call Stanley Steamers and he could take my LS voucher and go. I did not want him even touching my other rooms that I paid for with the voucher!When I was on the phone he went and sprayed chemicals on my carpet and  he was very haughty and said, "that I said yes to him cleaning the stairs and that he had already mixed the solution.  He was packing up and was not going to clean the stairs  because i said i was not going to pay and I took his nozzle because he was just  going to leave it damaged.  The police were called and he did end up cleaning the stairs but now they are a saturated, muddy, mess!  I called and spoke to Michelle, the owner and said she should come see the saturated towels I used to sop up the mess!  She said since I did not pay for the carpet cleaning on the stairs, that it was not a concern of hers since I was not a customer.  I would advise anyone "buyer beware"!  Michelle advised me to stick with companies I know and that Stanley Steamer uses a different system.PCC uses a portable system and that would be fine if they did a good job, but they did not! I would also say they are anything but professional!   This was the worse company I have ever dealt with and I really suggest  again BUYER BEWARE!Barb Toman(With damaged carpets)
