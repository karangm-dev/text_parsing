The food was good, but literally had the worst service ever! Took about 10 minutes for anyone to even greet us. The appetizer we shared came out with no plates! We had to ask a host walking by, not our server, to get us those. A food runner brought the entrees out & had to ask him, not our server again, for refills. The server finally did stop by and ask if everything was ok, after we already had everything we needed!! Won't go back unless I sit at the bar, the place wasn't busy enough for the service to be that bad!!
