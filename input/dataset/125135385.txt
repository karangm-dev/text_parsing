This bar is the manifestation of bigotry and homophobism. There is currently (1/17/16 2:30 AM) a bouncer working at Bar Madame Lee who was so disgusted by my appearance with my partner that he came up to us, asked me if I was bothering anyone (which I was not), which obviously made my drunk self angry. You may argue that I was drunk that's why this event occurred, but this bouncer hired to be ready for this type of behavior. I proceeded to tell him to mind his own business. After this, he took offense from my ridiculously "gay" behavior and put me in a headlock, dragged me out the door, and threw me into the middle of the street. I did not fight back. After I began to get up, this homophobic bouncer took me by the head, and threw me back onto the ground. He left me alone after this. Madame Lee, if you keep this bouncer hired after this repulsive night, I will make sure that not only does your club suffer legal action, but furthermore it will enjoy no more visitors. This bouncer was of a brown complexion, probably around 5' 11", and had a beard.
