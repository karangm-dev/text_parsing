I originally placed a comment on yelp in regards to the lack of service from this agents office. The fact is this agent has a complete lack of understanding of listening and acknowledging issues that arise.Such as incorrect information, my policy information being sent to someone that I had requested not be sent certain information. as well as incorrect information stated and the lack of taking responsibility. I recently received a call from the agent Mary advising me she had received my request to switch agents, which I sent much earlier on. The agent had taken a lengthy amount of time to transfer my policy, which I confirmed does not take much time to take place. Even after my policies where transferred to the new agent she or her office still failed to send everything over which caused a delay in obtaining a life insurance policy. Mary personally requested I remove my yelp page comment. I advised I would not. She explained that she feels its incorrect. I explained she can comment on my review as I have done for my own personal business. I advised her I felt it was very unethically for her to ask me to remove it. At that point the conversation came to end.Today 10/13 I received an email from Yelp reference case 5065974 advising me they had removed my review of yelp because it had been brought to their attention by the yelp community that it fell outside of their content guidelines because it did not provide enough detail. It a little funny that someone had said that to yelp, after receiving a verbal request from Mary herself to remove it. I will pursue this unethical action further.
