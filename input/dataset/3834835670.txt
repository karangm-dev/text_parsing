AMAZING PIZZA!!!!! Love this place!!!!!!I LOVE the 800 Degrees in LA, so I was super excited to find this restaurant on the strip!All the pizza options are awesome....I especially loved the verde one, cause I'm a sucker for green sauce. The toppings are yummy and fresh.....love the capers and kalamata olives. If you like spicy pizza, DEFINITELY get the chili sauce topping! It's to die for!  I even bought a bottle of the chili sauce on my 3rd visit here. EXTRA plus......it's walking distance from Aria.....so you can get great drinks and then head to 800 Degrees for a satisfying dinner :)
