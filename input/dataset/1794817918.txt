Beyond and above the best service and quality!Joy and Stan helped make my marriage proposal epic.  I ordered my tux in Houston with the plan of picking it up here in Las Vegas.  I called ahead and spoke to Joy.  I explained that I had only minutes to pick up and dress up before my proposal and wedding would take place.  She was wonderful and when I arrived everything was perfect.  Stan was fantastic and altered the Jacket sleeves to fit perfect.  Both people helped tremendously.  I had the perfect tux and everything went perfect.  lol, Joy even gave some advice that I followed during the proposal and it was spot on.  Thank you so much.  I put it on you tube, and am attaching a link where you can view the actual proposal.  It's kind of funny.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvgEZGHYFO4&t=51s if this does not work you can search youtube, just type in; Las Vegas Proposal, Ring, shoes, jewlery and a Dress. She said yes.
