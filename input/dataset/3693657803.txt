I went into this salon at 530 on a Wednesday evening there were only two other customers in the bldg.   I normally have the same girl do my nails, but she was doing another ladies nails so they gave me to another lady as I was explaining what I wanted done she had a hard time understanding I tried my best to explain,it was pretty simple ,she rolls her eyes at me and begins to get rude.  I am not gonna let her roll her eyes at me when I tip these girls 20 per visit.  There are 10 or more nail salons in this fiver mile radius. I won't ever walk in there again they only do an ok job anyway
