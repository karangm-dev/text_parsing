Love Love Love this restaurant. Food is so tasty and nicely served. Rudy is great, comes to your table to make sure everything is good, which it always is. Service is great, kudos to Rose and everybody else. So happy this gem is in our neighborhood. My husband always orders the Cioppino and I order something different every time and have never been disappointed. Thank you Rudy and staff.
