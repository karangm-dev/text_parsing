where can I start slow unfriendly service... I ordered a mangoneada lets just say it taste like tamarindo... and it's supposed to be mango the mango was not even ripe and raspado was tasteless  and very coarse and clumpy ice...I also ordered tostilocos huge portion but once again bland and tasteless will never come back
