I had lens replacement surgery with multi focal implants done today with Dr Micheal  Myles and couldn't wait another minute to tell you how AMAZING the whole experience was.        First of all. everyone from the receptionist to the surgeon was impressive.  Professional, knowledgable, and at the same time patient and caring.  Special shout out to Dr. Beach,  a very bright  star in the Lasikmd constellation.       Ok, having said that, I didn't go there to make friends, I went there to get my eyes fixed cause I hated wearing glasses.  Well, I had lens replacement surgery a little over twelve hours ago, my glasses are in the garbage and I am writing this on my ipad quite comfortably (Geez, I can even read where it says ipad in tiny letters in the upper left corner of the screen next to the wifi signal strength)    Quick And Painless.  Unbelievable results.  Absolutely worth  the money.I had my free consultation done downtown Toronto. and my surgery  at the Mississauga clinic and found the same degree of professionalism and care at both locations. An extremely impressive clinic full of people who are proud of what they do.   Could not be happier.
