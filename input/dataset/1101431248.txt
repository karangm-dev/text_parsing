Los Olivos has obviously stopped trying. The food was below average, even by gloppy Mexican food standards.  Our party of 12 was served efficiently and with warmth by the staff. Lovely people. But most of the food is just ok. Everyone liked the cheese crisps, which were on very thin, crispy tortillas. The beef burrito was beef and a tortilla -- nothing else; very bland. I had the fish taco. Rubios is far better. Combo plates are in the $12-15 range, which I think is robbery for food this average. If you're craving 70s Mexican food, with soupy refried beans, gobs of cheese, this might be your place.
