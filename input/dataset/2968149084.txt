Triple chocolate Tsoynami.......love!!! Greens. I love everything I have tried here.I have tagged along to Tempe several with hubs on "work" meeting trips and I really glad that I did, would have never discovered Greens.Its funny EVERY time we see our omni friend he mentions the Big Wac (which is a similar version of Doomie's Big Mac only WAYYYY better) at Greens! Super funny, soon I will hear of a omni driving to Tempe via Vegas to get a Big Wac. I always get the Buffalo Chkn' sandwich which is similar to Garden Grill. Its a cute little casual place and the service has always been fast and friendly.I really need to try different things when I come here next time.......but our standard choices......always fulfill!!!! 5 stars!
