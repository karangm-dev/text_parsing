Absolutely hate it here! Management sucks, a/c sucks, loud renovation sucks. Everything sucks! Especially the infested ass facility as a whole. I'm over this place. Lease is up in 2 months.My main concern is the water. The boiler never works! And since it is always malfunctioning we are either left to take ice cold showers or have no water at all. I work until 10 pm, so when i get home i expect to take a warm shower. Not here you won't! It seems as though the hot water goes off at a certain time. That certain time i always after i get home. Its ridiculous!As others mentioned the a/c and heater issue, I'll mention it as well. Because they turn the boiler off and on, you don't have the luxury of setting your desired temperature. For instance its been hot out lately so the heat has been y turned off until November, only cold air is available. Now that may not sound too bad, but it has been raining heavily the past couple of days. I would love to come in my apartment, turn on the heat and warm up after being drenched in rain water. Sadly that won't be happening. If I'm cold i just have to suck it up or wrap myself in blankets because i cannot turn the heat on. Its really unfortunate!
