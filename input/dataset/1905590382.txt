I really had a bad service today with Atlas, after 1.5 years of being loyal to the company. The cab driver charged me 10 dollars more because he said I was moving when I wasn't. I was carrying my bags to my boyfriend's house because we are travelling tomorrow. Of course I was going to call Atlas to go to the airport but now I just changed to Diamond. The driver was condesending when I asked him to take a different route, saying he knew Montreal better than me. I was so angry that I didn't even let  the driver touch my things. I practically gave him a $10 tip for nothing. This is what you get for loyalty. Zero appreciation in return. And this is how you lose customers.
