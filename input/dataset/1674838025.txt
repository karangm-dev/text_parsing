Very happy with everything from the first call I made to set up the appointment, to the inspection, and finally getting the report.  I really appreciated the extra effort they showed during the inspection to show and educate me about certain features of the house.  I am a big fan of supporting a business that shows that they care about customers and I also like supporting veteran owned/operated businesses.
