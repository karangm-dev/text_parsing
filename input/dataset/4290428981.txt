Not sure if its me but the food out here just isn't tasty as the south..  Took my fiance out for dinner here and had the mango habanero wings and I'm going to say these were possibly the worst wings I've ever had.  It was if they were just deep fried with out any seasoning and dipped in some sauce and the chicken still had that raw taste.  The salmon taco and the queso tasted bland, not to mention we found not 1 but 2 hairs in the food.  1st impressions are important in my opinion so we probably won't ever eat here again.
