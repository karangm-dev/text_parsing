Being a Chandler based company myself, I think that Max. Title loans is nothing but a poorly managed and poorly owned company, that is if you can call them a real company !! The management was supposed to call me about a first payment 50 % off that I was supposed to be granted, I never received a call from them, so I called them today, and still no resolution. I am Arizona born and raised, and a Chandler based business owner. I never would allow any of this type of shady business to even come close to my business morals. I took out a small 400 dollar loan for promotional material, and wow, I have learned my lesson o dealing with a title loan facility !!  They are there to rip you off, and make money by making your financial situation even worse than when you started business with them !! Don't ever do business with Maximum Title Loans !!!!!!
