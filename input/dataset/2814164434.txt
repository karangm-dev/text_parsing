Nice people.  Terrible TERRIBLE service. I left a simple zipper repair that they told me it would take two days at most. I left the samples apple repair that they told me would take 2 days at most. I called 4 days later, and my wingsuit was not yet done. I told them I would be out of town for one week, and would like to pick it up when I returned.I called on my return, and left a message for them to call me back.No call came.Three days later, I stopped by the store, to pick up my wing suit that should have been done 2 weeks before  it still wasn't done.It was a simple zipper repair, a single 19 inch zipper the needed to be replaced. Nothing more. It was something up had done many times another shops around the country. Usually, it takes a day to 2 days to get it done. This couldn't do it in 2 weeks. Terribly disappointed as I have several sport sewing needs.Most of all, I was disappointed that my weekend plans were destroyed.
