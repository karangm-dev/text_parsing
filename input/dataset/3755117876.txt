Confirmed our rental twice the day before we were supposed to pick up the car. Arrive the next morning to pick it up and they tried telling us we rented a small car instead of the Nissan Armada? Then they proceeded to say the Armada had been recalled this morning and they took it to the Nissan dealership...keep in mind we showed up at 7:45 so they would've had to take car earlier than that. No one seemed to know what they were doing it is an absolute mess here I do not recommend whatsoever. Seemed very shady
