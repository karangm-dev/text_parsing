I needed my annual eye exam and decided to try Focused on Eyes. I'm happy I did! It was a pleasant experience. I didn't have to wait to be seen, they were prompt in all areas, including reception area, and fitting of new glasses. Dr. Lucas gave me an extensive eye exam, answered all my questions and concerns and was very nice and professional. My eyes aren't too bad but in my aging process things are changing at a rapid pace and I found a place that I can feel confident in taking care of my eyesight and glasses needs for years to come! Thanks to Dr. Lucas and her team!
