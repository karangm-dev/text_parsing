Honestly, it is a hit or miss with great service at this location. Couple of months back, I received great service with employees wanting to give me service (they all asked if I needed help or being helped). However tonight was the worst night at Best Buy because of one rude employee. At the check out she was talking to another employee making inside jokes when I wanted to ask her questions. When we did ask her questions she showed impatience and responded with not so kind attitude.
