Unbearably AWFUL logistics. Yesterday we went to pick up our bibs, and gear and the computers didn't work so we got handmade bibs and our race times were way off as a result.  The provided sportswear was way too small. 4 for 4 of us felt like everything was at least a size off "normal". My biggest gripe though has to do with the getting in and out which so overshadowed the actual race and chocolate that we'd never go back. These geniuses basically made 10,000 people who did the 5k that started first (???) wait while the 15k runners lingered on the course which conveniently blocked the only main exit from the parking lot, BRILLIANT!!!! Thousands of us just stood around for an hour and twenty minutes waiting for these runners to clear the course/road which blocked the exit.   Just to be clear, not blaming the runners, blaming the race organizers who planned a course and start times that have the longer race starting later and then routed the course right in front of the only major exit from the parking lot. Do yourself a favor, go for a run, then go to Starbucks and get a mocha and donate $10 to Make a Wish and you'll be MUCH better off, save a bunch of money and have far more fun than we had today.
