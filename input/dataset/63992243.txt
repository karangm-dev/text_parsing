Handcrafted cocktails, gorgeous patio, awesome live band, good weather, friends play a part too. Sign me up!!!! Maybe I've been late to the game but seriously amazing experience, it's much needed here in Vegas. I was attracted to this place by the band, the lead singer looked like Johnny Depp and had the versatility of 500 songs. The patio has couches and plush velvet pillows along with tables. Also, there is mass wall that opens the interior to the outside, it's really unique.The cocktails are priced at $14 a pop which is decent for handcrafted, customized, quality drinks. You will have a good buzz after the 1st and 2nd one for sure. The cocktail menu is to the point they have your traditional ones except with their own signature twist. I ordered the "Mule it over" and it was fresh perfect for these warm summer nights.The inside decor is dark with avant-garde type feel. Plush dark accents featuring experimental artwork. I absolutely was mesmerized by the live band and ambience of the entire venue. I had the perfect chill night under candid lighting.
