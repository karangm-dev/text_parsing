This Dairy Queen has a history of messing up orders at the drive thru.  Today I sent my daughter to pick up food for our family.  When she got back home we discovered that they shorted us my son's burger meal.  My daughter called and the girl said she remembered putting it in the bag and hung up on my daughter.  My son now doesn't have his food and I'm far too angry to go back there.  I can understand the missing food but denying it and hanging up is unacceptable .  The food isn't all that good for this hassle.
