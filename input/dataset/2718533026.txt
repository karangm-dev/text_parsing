My husband and I absolutely love this place! We frequent it a couple times a week almost.. The food is always consistently delicious, the management and staff are very friendly.. especially Luulis! ( WE LOVE LUULIS! sp? ) The vibe is very kick back.. great atmosphere and great, healthy food! And you can't go wrong with the $2 beers on tap.. yummy!  A gem in Boca Park indeed! Try the $6 'brunch' on Saturdays and Sundays with all you can drink mimosas!
