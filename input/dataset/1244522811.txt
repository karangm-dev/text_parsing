Loved! But I might be bias because I do love anything country. Was my first time here, good food and good drinks. The staff was very friendly and food came quick, although it wasn't really full when we went. Found a new favorite drink, it's a specialty drink called "Whiskey Girl", which came in a mason jar. I'm a fan of Jack so I had to try it. If anyone remembers what is in this drink feel free to let me know. Got to have more of this drink!
