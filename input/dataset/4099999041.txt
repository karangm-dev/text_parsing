Top 5 worst transaction with a business, overall worst for a restaurant. I hate leaving reviews, and have never left a negative review. I usually show dissatisfaction through never going back. However, the manager's inability to do their basic job makes me feel like I need to spread the word. We went Memorial Day, it was busy, but expected. Coming in we had eaten there last year and it was awesome, so when we were told it was a 20 min wait... we thought it would be worth it.  During that time I overheard 2 people getting checks "adjusted" and I thought "hmmm cost of a busy day."  We were seated in only 5 min so I brushed it off and thought "home run".  Service was typical busy restaurant, slow but friendly. We waited 45 minutes for biscuits and gravy and a eggs Benedict, which came out cold. After 2 bites, we asked for the check and we told her the food was cold/gross.  Waitress apologized and offered to adjust the check. I thought that was fair and it was my mistake for coming on a day in which they were overwhelmed. The check came back with 5 dollars off a 30 dollar tab... And she acted like that was fair and left. I was sooo pissed I paid, left no tip and left as quickly as possible because I did not want to embarrass my girlfriend.  In the car, she asked why I didn't ask for a manager and proceeded to call.  She got a hold of the manager who claimed she would get me a refund and call back... no refund, no call back.  Never going back.
