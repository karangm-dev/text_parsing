Yes the line is long. Yes it seems like it takes forever, especially if you were up until 5, or 6am. But it moves faster then it looks, and it's worth it. You have to get the cookie, and go with whatever breakfast sandwich you desire. The classic biscuit you can't go wrong with. This isn't a place that just tastes good because your hungover, you can really taste the heart, soul, and fun that they put into the food. It's what gets the people going when in LV!
