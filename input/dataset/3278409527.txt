One star is too many! 10/24/2014 Long line, long wait. Agent spent at least 15 minutes haggling with me to "upgrade." What a waste of my time! Just give me what I reserved. ONE damn gate open for EVERYONE to exit through. Extremely impolite, disgruntled gatekeeper says I'm in the wrong car. Jesus. We both look at paperwork which says otherwise. She's obviously further frustrated by their blatant mistake, as am I. The agent assigned me the wrong car. She instructs me that I am going to put this wrongly assigned car back? God forbid a Budget employee or manager should correct their own mistake! She then tries to make at least 10+ cars behind me back up so I can turn around and drive through oncoming traffic in order to put wrongly assigned car back. That went well. All the while she is yelling driving commands at me and gesturing at me in a most degrading way. How embarrassing!  I have NEVER, EVER been treated in such a way by another human! I was SO upset I couldn't possibly drive after that! I hope that gatekeeper gets herself right with the Lord! Budget, you seriously need to weed out some people!
