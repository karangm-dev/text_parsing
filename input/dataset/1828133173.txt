I was here last night after the game. The place was packed full. There was bull riding and cotton candy served in very large metal martini glasses. We asked for a table for dinner with a 30 min wait. This was not surprising and we got a table sooner then what they guessed.  However the place was so packed that I lost the host trying to navigate us to our table.  So I went back to the host stand and explained I lost my party. They did not lead me to my table when I ask where my party went. The guy just told me they were somewhere in the front and pointed in a general area. I had to text my date to come and get me. The waitress was friendly and always checked in on us regularly.  The part that really sucked, after we placed our order my date wanted to show me the fire pit to ask I wanted to roast marshmallows.  We left our drinks on the table and we're gone less then 3 minutes.  In that time the host sat another party at the table and took our drinks away. It was bad enough that we lost our table but it was horrible that my $15 drink was taken before I had even had a chance to try it. I think they should have given me my drink back instead of making me buy a new one.
