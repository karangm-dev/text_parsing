I found West Russell Animal Hospital over two years ago when my dog, Oscar, had an issue with his paw. Now my husband and I have Oscar and our two Golden Retrievers, Max and Ellie. All three LOVE going to see the staff at West Russell. We take the dogs there for both their routine vet visits as well as boarding while we're away. Their pricing is extremely affordable and the entire staff is beyond amazing. I recommend them to anyone looking for the best animal hospital in town, and many of my friends go to them and have to same appreciation for them as I do!
