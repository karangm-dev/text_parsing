Would give negative stars if I could. My girlfriend and I were forced into a week and a half of hell because Grifols couldn't be bothered to ensure their screenings were correct and gave me a false positive for syphilis. Furthermore, after being cleared by the Southern Nevada Health District, I was informed I would be deferred from selling my plasma for 12 months anyway.These are irresponsible, reckless blood farms, and poor farms at that, treating its plasma mules without respect nor professionality, giving out false information otherwise as well, from telling me incorrect information on my next steps to the amounts of donor fees to the schedule of donor fees to handing out false positives for serious diseases that they continue to treat like positive results.It is much more than unfortunate that I need to sell plasma (let's not b.s. here - this is no donation, they make well more than $1,000 from every sizeable bottle of plasma you sell to them) for money in the first place. Try basically any other plasma center than Grifols/Biomat/talecris. There is a reason these locations are established in the ghettos and barrios of America.
