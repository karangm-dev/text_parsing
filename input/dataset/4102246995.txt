Multiple times now, maybe as high as 50%, where the drive through staff takes the order wrong, puts in the wrong food, or shorts an item. Just was shorted an item again and didnt realize this time until after driving away.  When you ask to get it fixed you are usually greeted with a put-out attitude or downright rudeness. Consistently horrible service since the first week it opened. I'd give 0 stars if that were an option.
