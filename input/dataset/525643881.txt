Unpredictable service .My order back in February 2016, was filled without an issue. On my order of July 2016, all I got was the run around. It is in stock and shipping today.... no wait the item is not in stock, it will ship on August 4th.....; no wait now another item in your order is out of stock, your order won't ship until August 11th. GPS City customer service representatives could not have been more disinterested in assisting me.Rather than order from GPSCity, spend your hard earned money on a Vegas slot machine, you'll probably get a better return.
