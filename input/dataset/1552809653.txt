Service was horrific.  We couldn't get napkins without begging.  I ordered Fajitas and waited at least 10 minutes after they were delivered to get a plate to eat from.  The chips are really thin.  The house salsa was way too lemony.I am amazed that this is a successful restaurant.I'm from texas and am tough judge of texmex.  The charro beans were the best I've had in Charlotte.  Only place I've had really good tortillas but they had way too much flour covering them.
