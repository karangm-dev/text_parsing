This is the worst mechanic I have EVER been to. The owner Jim is a lying smooth talking thief. He charges for work not completed, does unreliable work, nd is extremely unreliable. I've had brakes done, engine work, and it has all ended horrendously. Please, save yourself and don't go here. Your health and wallet will both thank you. I give 0 stars
