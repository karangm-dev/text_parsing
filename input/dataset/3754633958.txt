Only picked one star since 0 wasn't an option.  Like many of the other reviews, this is a scam.  Not sure how this business remains open.  I purchased a facial for my daughter as a Christmas present through Living Social.  She booked the appointment during her spring break when she was home.  Michelle rescheduled the appointment last week.  When my daughter showed up, the place was dark and locked.  She called 3x and waited 30 minutes.  The adjacent salon owners said Michelle had been there earlier, then said she was leaving for the day!  This was 3 days ago and she has still received no response.  Thankfully, Living Social gave me a credit for the money I paid.  Don't waste your time or money on this "business"!!
