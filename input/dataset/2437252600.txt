What an awesome aquarium!! I like to stop in at the Silverton and check out the fish tank or have a drink at one of the themed bars around the casino.  I like how this casino has a more relaxed feel yet still shares the excitement of the Vegas scene.  They also host a lot of events like the Pure Aloha festival and the Food Truck Fest so I find myself at this casino more than most.  Plus, I hear that the buffet has a Polynesian night on Thursdays?  Gonna have to review that and let you know in the next review ;)
