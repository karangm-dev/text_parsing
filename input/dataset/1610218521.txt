I hate coming to this urgent care but Because of my insurance and the proximity to my house its my default urgent care.  There is no sense of urgency what's so ever here.  Some of the medical assistants look like they jut rolled out of bed without showering or laundering their scrubs. The front desk can be very slow.  Some of the dr's hate being there.  If you have a choice go elsewhere.
