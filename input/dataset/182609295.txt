Bright Lights Big City is Las "Fu@king" Vegas! One of the greatest city's on the planet in my opinion. Where else can all your vices become reality in one place and its legal? Las Vegas is a playground for adults. Whether your into gambling , drinking, sex, shopping or    Voyeurism is your thing it's all acceptable. This desert playground caters to the young & old. I come out 3 or 4 times a year for some gambling, personal vices & Tiki Drinks @ FRANKIES! Your not really living life if your not consuming rum based drinks in Vegas... This playground offers some of the finest live entertainment around. Whether it's a concerts, XXX strip clubs and night clubs with unbelievable DJ's including Paul D from the Jersey Shore ( Heyyyyyy Buddyyy )!Dining is paramount when I'm in Vegas. I've sampled unbelievable steaks ( Joe Vicarios) , Italian ( Piero's ) and Thai food ( see La Thai on Fremont street) along with wonderful bottles of wine. Vegas is truly the bacchanal for food lovers  & beverage consumption.I'm sure you'll locate what you need in LV but it's my damn review so deal with it!Frank & Elvis have left the building!
