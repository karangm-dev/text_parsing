Ok, so yes, I've had some work done but having kids can really take a toll on your body!  Dr. Angelchik's office staff is top notch.  From the first call, I felt extremely informed and welcomed.  They inundate you with information, which can be overwhelming but they leave nothing out.I had consultations with other doctors who didn't give me half the information and certainly didn't make feel as comfortable.Dr. Angelchik is pretty dry personality wise but I'm not paying for someone to be charming or a stand up comedian.  He is straightforward and serious about what he does.  That intensity certainly comes through in his work.  Dr. Angelchik gave many warnings about the different outcomes that were possible but my outcome was nothing but perfection.  (Yes, I love my new ladies!)I highly recommend  Dr. Angelchik and his staff.
