Please think twice when buying a pet from Petland!THE LATEST.....Petland insurance requires to purchase 3 items a quarter (food being one) but what do you do when they don't have the food you have been purchasing in the past??????? When your dog has sensitive stomach you can't just switch to another kind. Yes, they ran out of food and they still make you liable if you don't purchase three items!
