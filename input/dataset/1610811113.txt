This is a very fun restaurant with amazing food. I go to the other location just about every day and wanted to give this one a try so I did and was very pleased. It feels like a different restaurant because of the size but it's the same great food and same fun vibe. The staff is great and I will definitely be coming back on the regular to see them. Come in twice a week till you've tried the entire menu,  i promise you'll be glad you did.
