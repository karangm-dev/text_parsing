It is so difficult for me to wrap my brain around the fact that I was in a traumatic car accident and then to be verbally abused by the tow truck driver, which is what happened to me. I am so upset.  This company has a contract with the City of Phoenix, their contract should not be renewed. They are a rip off, would not tow to my house, and I had a truck full of valuable tools, DV Towing insisted my vehicle go to the yard first so they could get the fee, and then to my house.  I refused medical treatment at the scene as to not leave my vehicle with all of my expensive tools in it.  I was injured and the tow truck driver for DV towing told me to go get a rock to put under my tires.  I told him to buzz off, and then he went and complained to the cops about me!  I had just been t-boned by another driver and then have this jerk to deal with.  Needless to say, I called another company and they towed right to my house.  If I or anyone would be incapacitated and not able to express our wishes for our vehicle and the location that it should be towed to,  DV Towing would use this to collect as many yard fees as they could.  The driver was verbally abusive to me and they are dishonest.  City of Phoenix pay attention! I am going to the City of Phoenix to file or complain to whomever will listen.
