Went for Saturday Brunch. Wait was doable compare to other buffets. We paid about $38/person which was standard for Vegas buffet. However, everything was underwhelming, nothing really stood out from their selection. For the price and to pay just a little extra, I'd recommend Wicked Spoon or Bachannal
