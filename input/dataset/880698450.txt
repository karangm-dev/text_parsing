CHOCOLAAAAATE Yes, I am contributing into the vast majority of people who likes chocolate, especially dark chocolate, bitter dark chocolate, very bitter.I came here with high hopes. Hunting for a dark chocolate crêpe, I dove into the rich and mouth-watering menu. My eyes reading through every word and glancing at every pictures, I read until I could find those three words: "dark chocolate" & "crêpe". The hunt has been a success. I've hunted down this bitterness. Satisfiction within my grasp and within my mouth. Mmmmmh... yes, it is the Mochaholic. Behold! And yes I strongly recommend the Mochohalic for anyone who likes or can stand the taste of dark chocolate. It was a perfect blend of sweetness and bitterness. Not too bitter nor too sweet. Drinks are good too, but I'd rather have something to chew!Also, there might be a waiting queue outside. But they were kind enough to give us cups of hot chocolate while we were waiting!
