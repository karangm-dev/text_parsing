The WORST wings I've ever eaten!!  I cancelled my main course order because the wings made me ill.  I was still charged for the wings, and the chickencrap manager didn't have the guts to come out and talk!  They did send a lettuce salad "on the house" after I was told the wings would be taken off the bill.  Of course, the wings were not taken off thebill, but the server was nice and I didn't want to create a scene.  I paid, but will not go back to Outback in Chandler, Az!!  Oh, by the way, I spent an hour on the Hershey Highway when I got home!  Unless I get at least an acknowlegement from the manager, I will not go back, and will continue the email campaign against this Outback in Chandler, AZ (located next to the Chandler Mall)!!  If you go, stay away from those poop inducing wings!!
