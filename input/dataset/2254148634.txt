I've been a follower of Loose Moose Theatre for Kids since my kids were small - that's about 20 years. Now I take my grandchildren and we all love it. The seating is really good - you can see clearly from any seat. Your kids can have their snacks during the performance and are encouraged to interact with the performers during the play. How awesome is that? It's comfortable, great fun, usually has some jokes built into the play geared for the adults (clean of course) and afterwards the kids can meet the actors to talk and get their programmes signed. Terrific entertainment and not too lengthy for the kids. The location is good as well because you can explore the market and galleries which reside in the same building. Yes! Enjoy!
