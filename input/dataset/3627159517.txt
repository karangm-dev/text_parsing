We should have checked Yelp first... We went for breakfast, mainly out of the convenience of it being downstairs. I love buffets, but this one was SUPER underwhelming, and expensive to boot. Almost $20 for breakfast? We stayed at the Monte Carlo last year, and their buffet was better and less expensive!There was a ton of food - I thought they had a good selection, but nothing was really that tasty. The bacon was all underdone and greasy, the salami/cheese/antipasto table seemed like it had been sitting out for FAR too long, and I grabbed an eggs benedict cup (made of a little sourdough bowl with the egg, etc inside of it) but didn't eat it because the egg looked so undercooked once I was back at the table. The omelet bar was really the shining star, but there was a consistent line of 10-12 people there at all times and we were on a time crunch, so I didn't get a chance to try it out. To be fair, I only had breakfast there, but based on the food I got for breakfast I wouldn't go back. Buffets in Vegas are a dime a dozen, and this one had absolutely nothing special to it.
