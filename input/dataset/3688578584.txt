They have great quality stuff here.  I was escorted in by my brother who is more fashion forward than I am.  The staff was helpful selecting jeans that work best for me based on my descriptions.  Since I don't speak the fashion lingo, they had to interpret my words and find the right jeans for me.  The brands change, so if you know enough to be looking for something specific, maybe you should call ahead.Basically, I was looking for something that would be stylish, but not so much so that it would be out of a style in 6 months.  When you're paying several $100-200 for jeans, you'd like to get some mileage out of them.The staff was great explaining how the jeans would wear and break in.  They also were particular to explain how to wash them (or not wash them).  They also do free alterations, which I've never done for jeans, but makes total sense when you're trying these on.  We live out of town so they took our email and followed up a few days later with the tracking number on the package to arrive soon.  It's this extra bit of service that makes it worthwhile.If you're thinking "why would I pay so much for jeans?", consider that these are the kind you'll wear all the time and will look great with the custom fit that comes with the tailoring.  If you're willing to pay several hundred for a suit that you wear to the occasional wedding or funeral, why not invest a little in your everyday wear?They also have a frequent buyer card where after enough purchases you get half off.  They took the half off the most expensive pairs which really impressed me.They currently do not accept American Express which surprises me given the quality of merchandise.  :(
