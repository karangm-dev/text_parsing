Alis is a genius.  I came to her with orange hair (instead of the intended honey blonde) and a cut that did NOT suit my natural curls.Because I have naturally thin, frizzy hair in a naturally very ashy brunette, I had worn it short for over a decade, thinking I could not pull off a longer, feminine style.She has corrected my color and, for the first time in over ten years, has been able to guide it back into some length that's actually beautiful.Her personality is warm and friendly, and her professionalism is impeccable.  She is a true artist with a passion for her craft.  She sincerely enjoys helping her clients look and feel amazing.She is booked for weeks out so if you want her, schedule well in advance.  She's worth the wait.
