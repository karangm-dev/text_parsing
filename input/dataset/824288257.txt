M. Trois now serves authentic Szechuan hot pot in an all you can eat format.The base is prepared from scratch in house with imported spices and beef broth is used as the foundation for the soup.The owner went to her wife's home town in Szechuan and trained for 3 months on how to make authentic spicy broth and brought back dozens of spices from China.You can have the spicy broth, non-spicy broth, or half and half.I guess the only potential shortfall is that they only serve hotspots in a large format for now (which is the traditional way), but that means that you'll have to be ok with everyone dipping their chopsticks into the same boiling pot.
