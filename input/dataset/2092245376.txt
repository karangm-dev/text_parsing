First let me say, I cannot attest to the prices because I went here for a pre screening of Ted. (Hilarious by the way...) But, looks are deceiving that's for sure. I had never been to the Concord Mall and when you go over by the movie theater there is a mall entrance and a door that says separate entrance to the movie theater, or something along those lines. It's kind of a weird walk way into a tan door that leads into the mall by Forever 21 and the theater is to the right. It was a nice looking place and we got right in with our tickets. We decided to get popcorn, and that right there is a major reason for the 5 stars... not the popcorn itself, but the butter. OMG. I told the kid behind the counter that I wanted popcorn with alot of butter, and he pointed me towards the end of the counter..."The butter is at the end of the counter." WHATTTTTTT???? I get to pump my own butter? Do you realize I may die from clogged arteries right here in the walkway?? And that's exactly what it was like, they took the responsibility out of their own hands and said, "here ya go movie patron, make yourself as fat as you'd like!" UM OK!!!! I of course drowned my small bag of popcorn with that delicious stream of warm butter and happily strolled into the theater to find my seat. The actual theater is your typical place, nicely done and decorated. I felt like the theater we were in was a bit small, but that could have been because of all the people. There wasn't an empty seat in the place. It's a bit of a drive from my house, so I'd probably not venture out there too often, but if it's by you, I'd give it a thumbs up.
