I had a reaction to the wax.  When I went back to days later to see if they had any recommendations.  They took down my information and told me a manage would call me back.  No call back.  I went back again after another two days.  The manage was there and couldn't be bothered to come out from behind the desk to look at my skin.  She was not helpful and her resolution was to offer me a complimentary service.  Really?  I don't want to go back to have your team mess up my face.  She comment to me "I am not a doctor.  I can't give you medical advice."  How does a business that offers skin care services not have a protocol in place to handle adverse reactions?  I am not upset at the welts the product caused on my face, I am upset that they didn't seem to care or have any remedies.  Surely, I am not the first person to react to the wax in this way.  Completely unprofessional mgmt experience.  Stay away!
