I will never go to Toni & Guy again, and I do not recommend it. Roberto used to be my favorite stylist.  I thought he was really gifted, and also funny and charming and expensive.  Until my last appt.  I arrived on time, and he was still working on a previous client.  Thirty-five minutes into my appt., he was able to see me.  He rushed through my cut, and I was out of his chair in 25 min. flat.  This included the "style".  When I got home I realized he hadn't even finished the cut.  The quality was so far below anything he had done before.  My hair was horribly uneven on the bottom, and I had to trim it myself.  To top it all off, the young guy stylists in the adjacent two stations talked trash throughout my appt. about getting drunk and being lucky with the ladies.  Seriously offensive.  Roberto never apologized for being late, which would have made a difference to me.  No respect, no clients.
