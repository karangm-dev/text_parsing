One word.  Sangria.  I am a lightweight with the alcohol, and I had two glasses of their sangria.  It was excellent!  I had the spaghetti and meatballs for my main course and it was delicious.  We started with calamari for an appetizer and it was very nice as well.  It is a very cute place  I will definitely be going back.  I want to try some of their ravioli.  Excellent!!!
