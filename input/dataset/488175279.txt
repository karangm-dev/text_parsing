Cafe Monarch was hands down the best restaurant I've ever been to! Not only was the food phenomenal but the service was even more impeccable! Such a beautiful location for a birthday or anniversary (or in my case both ;P). So in love with this restaurant concept and can't wait to return for our next special occasion!
