I don't have much to say (which is never a good thing).. Service was slow.. We came on a Friday night so we expect it to be busy, but for the wait staff to be able to hanled it. I was brought the wrong drink after  already waiting 20 minutes for it. Appetizer came out with food. Wings were lacking flavor all around. I don't know why we ever bother going to any of the Buffalo Wild Wings. Never a good experience. Skip this place and head over to Olive Garden next door where they at least pretend to make their food from scratch
