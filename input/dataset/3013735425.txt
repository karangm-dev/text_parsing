This hotel is so beautiful!!! I love how they give the aesthetic of Venice with the waterway running through the shops. I've always wanted to ride the gondolas, but I've never really had time to. I love the specialty shops and stores that they have. They even have a living statue that caught me completely offgaurd in a good way. Their food court even has super delicious options like the place that sells lobster rolls at a decent price. Their moving walkways are super convenient to get to the Sephora on the street or to Madame Tussaud's. Most of the time when I come here I'm walking through to get to something specific, but I really do want to stay here sometime.#6/100
