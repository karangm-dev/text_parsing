Went here for a working lunch and he service was great! We went during a busy lunch I joe and got seated right away for 6 people. The ambiance was relaxing and the food was delicious and plentiful. The wait for the food wasn't bad either! Definitely a good spot if you want to have a business lunch or just a place to eat good food and get good service!
