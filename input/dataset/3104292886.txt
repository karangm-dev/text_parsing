I can't say enough great things about my experience here this past weekend. I had gone to a different location months back and left pretty unsatisfied as it seemed the number one goal of that location was just to try and sell me as much as possible.  When I let them know I was unsatisfied... it was "well we will only charge half the cost for a full hair to lighten it more." I had gone into get my dark brown hair ombr√© and realized that it may take a few sessions to get it as light as I wanted but when the staff didn't seem to care it turned me off. Needless to say I was scared to try and get my hair done again from this location so I searched yelp and found the location on windmill and pecos had some great reviews..:I called in the morning and was scheduled shortly after. Brittney was my hair stylist and I had told her about my previous experience... She was shocked to hear about the last experience and assured me I would be happy.  During the whole process she was amazing... explaining every step.  My hair went from literally a line of copper brownish-blonde  to beautifully dimensioned array of highlights and lowlights:  I was so happy by the end and can't wait to go back.
