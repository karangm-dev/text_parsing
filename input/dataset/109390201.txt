On Thursday afternoon at 1:00 PM there was no problem parking. They did reserve seats for our group. This is a clean, quiet, no frills Mexican Restaurant.  We got attention as soon as we sat then five minutes after at which time we ordered. The Chips and salsa were very flavorful.  The service was brisk, and the food was served hot. Each plate that I saw was covered with food. The person that ordered tongue got to nice slices. I had  #14. The Chili Relleno was of good size, filled with cheese and smothered in a piquant sauce that had both liquid tomato and chunks. The chicken taco was about six inches long and four inches high. It was filled with chicken, and tasted strongly of that meat and the shell it came in. The rice was firm and the bans were smooth. I cleared the plate. Something I did not intend to do, that's how good it was. This is a no frills Mexican Restaurant. It's five stars because it does what it is so well. The food is reasonably priced. The service is quick without being rushy. It is clean throughout. I don't know what more you could want from a place like this. I give it FIVE STARS.
