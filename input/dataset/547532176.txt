Very clean and well-maintained KOA. Pool is pretty and weather was perfect for swimming. The mini-gold was extra at 2$ a person and 5$ charge if you lose the ball. The playground is super nice and the kids give it two thumbs up. The grounds are perfect for riding bikes and scooters to burn off that last little bit of super kid energy before bed. The showers are extremely clean as well as the bathrooms. The laundry room has lots of washers, dryers, and even laundry tub with folding table. The staff is very friendly bilingual. This is a great location near the city but able to have a relaxing wind down evening. Would recommend this location for families and anyone need to relax.
