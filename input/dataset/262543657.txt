Good service and great staff! was just looking for a winter beater at first but the sales rep Roger Yip offered to show me a much better choice. Ended up getting the new ILX in a super reasonable price and im honestly loving the car, whenever i have a question I would just email him and he'd reply me in a second. Definitely check out this dealership and this rep if you're looking for a car!
