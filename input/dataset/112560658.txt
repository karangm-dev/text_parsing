I've been coming to Armando's since they opened, I've only drive through and at any drive through you have to expect the person taking the order might have trouble hearing for whatever reason. Tonight I went to the drive through and the menu board light was off. I asked the person to turn on the light so I can see the menu. They didn't understand what I said so I raised my voice so they could hear me he said to come to the window. When I got to the window the I said I asked you to turn on the light so I could see the menu. That somehow insulted the person and I was told to go somewhere else. Ok easy I went to fredricos on happy valley problem solved. It's a shame the Help can't understand plain English. I will never bother them again. Mediocre Mexican food is everywhere and not hard to find. Armondos just lost a customer because the sensitive snowflake can't understand what I was try to say. I recommend filabertos, frericos, or even Taco Bell before Armando's.
