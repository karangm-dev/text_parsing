I am so incredibly happy we started coming here!My son had seen another dentist in Henderson. He needed a lot of work done, and it was taking multiple sessions at the other place as well as (what seemed to be) frustrated staff. After the third visit of trying to have extractions performed, the dentist gave up and we were rushed out of there left with the only option of paying $600 for anesthesia, NOT including the cost for the crowns/extractions/fillings. I called Just For Kids for a second opinion. I wasn't questioning the treatment but wanted to see what else we could do.The office staff and Dr. Dhillon have went above and beyond all expectations. My son has completed all the work he needed within 2 sessions and isn't upset or stressed like the other place made him.I thank all of you so much for what you do! We will absolutely come back for preventative or other care needed.
