I ordered the all you can eat rib special they have going on. The ribs were delicious. I also got 2 sides. The baked beans and Mac and cheese were great. even a piece of garlic toast. The sides are all you can eat but if you've read my previous posts I'm not taking up valuable meat space in my belly for a few beans I'm going to fast as it is. They have all you can eat specials that are weekly as well. Chicken ribs and pork are on there. I'll be back to see what the red neck egg rolls are like.
