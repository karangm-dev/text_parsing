I walked in and immediately asked how much a gel manicure would be, the gentleman informed me $25.00. I had my nails done and when I went to pay, my nail tech told me $35. I got a basic gel manicure. I'm unsure who was right and who was wrong but none the less, I felt deceived. Instead of arguing I said goodbye to my $10.00 (still tipped well) however I will not go back. It's a bummer because I liked my nail tech, but I want a salon I can trust. Never again!
