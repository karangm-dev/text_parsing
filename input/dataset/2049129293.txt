I was told as this being one of the few places that offers Korean BBQ buffet style. Went there on a Thursday night and it was pretty packed and chaotic in there. Service was decent and someone would come around frequently to change the grill plates if needed.But since my dining partner and I came for the meats, we were very disappointed. First off, few of the food items are labeled. Being familiar with Korean cuisine, I was able to recognize most of it but my friend was very confused about what many items were. There is a decent selection of meats, but none looked very fresh. And the conditions were a bit unsanitary as tongs were haphazardly thrown around and covered with meat juices. We tried a bit of everything, some beef, chicken, and pork. They tasted fine for the most part, but nothing to rave about or go back for seconds.The thing you need to keep in mind is that this is a buffet style place, so if freshness and really tasty food is your expectation, I wouldn't recommend going here. But for a small group, this might be a fun way to spend an evening.
