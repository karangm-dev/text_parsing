This was my wedding hall in 2015. Although when I checked it out at the beginning, it didn't look like it would be an impressive hall (it wasn't decorated when I saw it and it was in the process of being renovated), after decorating it for my wedding, the hall looked very nice. Suzanne, the manager there, did a great job of organizing everything in a very short period and on very short notice (2.5 months!!). She recommended the florist, DJ, photographer and the caterer, who all happened to be great and very affordable. This helped a lot considering that I was not from Phoenix and I only met with her and all the providers once. The wedding turned out to be beautiful and very organized. I depended on Suzanne and I didn't regret that one bit. Everyone talked about how the wedding was done beautifully, and how the food, music and service were all great! Everyone worked with me and got things done the way I wanted. I was at the end, a very happy bride :)
