I've been about four times now and every single time I am impressed. I usually get the mimosa salad with shrimp added, which is absolutely amazing, but today I decided to get the back porch BLT. Best. BLT. Ever. The fried green tomatoes are an awesome touch. Our waitress was super kind and helpful. Every time I've gone I've seen the owner around, which to me is a sign of a well-run business. Fair prices, amazing food, wonderful staff and beautiful wines. My only complain is I live pretty far from it so I can't go as often as I'd like.
