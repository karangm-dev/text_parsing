Thought about giving a 4-Star rating but that just wouldn't be fair.  If it's Diner food that you're looking for, this is definately the place to go.  The Hamburgers have perfectly cooked Angus beef on a golden grilled bun. The fries have that impossible to find crunchy outside & tender inside, every single one of them.   The Pastrami is tender, juicy, and plentiful and served on buttery grilled rye bread.  Be sure to order the "Scorpion" drink for a whole new twist on "Burger & Shake".  I wasn't expecting the "King of The Hill" of Diners but after 20 years of trips to Vegas,  this  was a long overdue & fortuitous find.
