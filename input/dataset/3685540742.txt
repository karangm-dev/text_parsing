Went into this restaurant after a terrible day. I was planning out how to kill myself cause I saw absolutely no point in life. I ordered my last meal and a genuine gentleman named Patrick took my order. He could tell something was up and asked me how I was. He was able to talk me back off the ledge and made me realize just how nice some people are. Men like him make this world go round. Please promote him, he deserves it.
