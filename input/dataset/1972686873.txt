Unrecommended.The food was mediocre at best.  However, the service here was absolutely crap.I ordered steak and eggs which they managed to screw up.  VERY RARE steak and egg whites only.  Nope.  These fools gave me a well done steak and scrambled the eggs.  They didn't charge me for only asking for egg whites so it's whatever.  I purposely waited until the check came before I ate my eggs so that in the event they did charge me extra, I can prove they did not give me what I had asked for.  I couldn't ask server Kayla because she disappeared off the face if the earth after she took our orders.The service was atrocious, at least from our server Kayla.  All she did was take our order.  Someone else brought out the food.  She never came back to ask how everything was.  She never came back to refill anything.    If fact, she didn't do jack sht.  The next time we saw her was when she came back to drop off the check without a peep.  Not even, "Can I get you anything else?"She comes back to get the check after I had signed for it and has the audacity to just stand there awkwardly at our table and stare at it... As if she's getting more than what she truly deserves!  Oh wait, she already did!For a food network star restaurant, food is probably a 2 or 3 (not horrible, but still disappointing) but service from this chick... 0.  She's lucky she got anything out of us.  I should have played the stupid foreign tourist card and left zilch $ for zilch effort.  There's a math wiz.
