I brought my daughter here for a trail class. We have enrolled her in sports (karate and rock climbing) to help her work through her fears. She's done so well over the summer that we thought we would look into parkour as the next step. We were at another gym last night that was a disappointment which made me want to see if all gums were like that. They aren't!  So far I am very impressed with the coaching and how engaged all the trainers are with the students!We'll be back here!
