We had such a fabulous dinner at Roy's this past weekend.  Everything was terrific.  The lobster potstickers were a huge hit as were the rib appetizer.  The ono and salmon were fantastic and the toffee blondie dessert was so delicious we practically licked the bowl it came in.  Our waitress was beyond nice.  HUGE TREAT to go here.
