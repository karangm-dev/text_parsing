Had a bad experience 12/03. Employee asked if my husband or I were veterans, answer-no. She asked if we are from Sun City, answer-yes. She said that qualifies us to pay the lowest price on the sales ticket. We shopped for half an hour or so and then took our purchases to be checked out by the same employee. She asked the same questions, we gave the same answers. She now said we have to pay full retail, the highest price. I pointed out that she told us we would pay the lowest price, she said she knows that but she was wrong.  Won't be returning.
