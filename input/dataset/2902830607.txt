I LOVE fry bread, so I was very excited to try Emerson Fry Bread.  I was not disappointed.  It's definitely not state fair fry bread.  The gentleman who took our order was lively and personable.  The time flies while you wait for your order because he's so entertaining!  I ordered the D$ (chicken & green chile).  It was actually no longer on the menu, but they hooked it up.  And I'm glad they did, because it was delicious!  The fry bread itself was perfect and wouldn't have changed one thing about any of the toppings.  The mixed greens were especially nice...definitely an upgrade from the tasteless iceburg that most places serve.  I will absolutely eat here again.  I have to try the steak!
