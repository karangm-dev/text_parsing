This is a strong contender for worst LCBO in the city. If you go there on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday evening, you will encounter 3 lineups of hipsters that run the full length of the store, effectively blocking most of the aisles and making shopping nearly impossible.The selection is not great either. They have decent enough beers, if only because of all the hipsters. Inevitably, there's always an alcoholic of some sort, who is already intoxicated and trying to buy a single beer in line. On one occasion, I witnessed the cashier defuse the situation really well, telling him in a really uppity tone to just come back in and hour or two when he had 'walked it off'. Of course the store would be closed in an hour but he didn't mention this to the guy and eventually he left without putting up too much of a fight or causing a scene.There's always a beggar or busker out front, which makes me want to go there even less. I really only buy alcohol here when I run out or need a gift quickly. I also use it as a place to get cash without having to pay an ATM fee since they do cash back. There's no TD Bank in the neighbourhood so it's pretty sweet unless you encounter the line, of course. I really wish they would expand this location. With the dollarstore at the corner of Concord and Bloor going out of business, this could be prime location for a new LCBO. I've also heard rumours of Wine Rack opening in the area, which could take some of the burden off this place. I like international wines but I would definitely go to WR, over this LCBO.
