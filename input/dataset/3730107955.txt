After doing my fair share of research for a great spot in Scottsdale I stopped in for lunch today and boy, was it worth the wait in line. I had a half grilled veggie sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese. The sandwich was very tasty; bread was perfectly toasted, veggies were cooked and seasoned well, and it had the proper amount of cheese. But the star of my meal was the mac and cheese. I tried to eat it slowly to savor every last bite. Easily the best mac and cheese that I've ever tasted. The one drawback was between waiting in line and waiting for the food it was a long lunch, but the food was well worth it. Fantastic.
