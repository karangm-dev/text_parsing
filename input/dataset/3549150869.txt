Watch for the charges at this place. They add 4.00 dollars to your bill without informing you that this is for a reported charity. They termed the charge AUGUST CHARITY  and say nothing about it to you. While I was there two other groups and myself complained about it. Who knows where the money goes?  Imagine the extra money they bring in. The food is typical Hooters.
