Very conveniently located off the strip. Very friendly and courteous staff. I especially appreciated the lighter complected black lady with pretty eyes who helped me after I stood in a long line. I didn't have stay long with my couple of items. She went out of her way to ensure I was treated great, I thank you!  :) I'm not from here, I was just eating over at the Ellis Island and needed a few things to bring back to the hotel room. I noticed that it was very quick & easy to hail a taxi. Funny thing is, the taxi hailed us!  lol :) Not a bad experience with this 7/11.
