This place is awesome. Small town feel in the city. Super friendly staff and very prompt.  I went there for the first time last year.  I was extremely sick with allergies.  They gave me a steroid, a few prescriptions and I was relieved in about an hour.  They always refill my allergy meds without issue and without coming back into the office.
