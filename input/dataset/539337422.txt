Found Payless Car Rental through Orbitz, due to it's cheap rental prices and conveniently placed near our destination in AZ. Don't be fooled however on thinking you're getting a great deal. On Orbitz, car rental was expected to be $21 a day this wasn't the case once we got to the front of the line however.After waiting in a long line of people who walked away from the desk with huge disappointment lingering on their faces and cursing under their breath, my mother and I realized what all the negativity was about.The car rental tacks on so many charges and fees, that $21 is long gone by the time they're finished telling you your total amount. Additional charges if you'd like a second driver, GPS, if you don't bring it back for a full tank you have to pay them to fill the tank for you, there is a deposit- which is understandable and of course you cannot make trips to Mexico.Payless is all about business and no customer service. We took our Nissan Altima for the weekend and brought it back to the rental center. This will be the last time we'll use Payless in the future.
