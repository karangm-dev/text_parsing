Services are reasonable priced and they are HONEST. They did not try to sell us unnecessary parts or services and they back up their work as well. Before Colburn, we had another plumber company (they advertise on the fwy billboards ("Yes, they can rip you off") come in to give an estimate.. What they quoted was 200% more expensive then what Colburn worked on for us. I called the office and asked why they are so expensive. The person on the phone told us that, "We are the best".... Well, I have to respond, "Best at ripping us off!" and hung up the phone up.Let's just say we will definitely use Colburn Enterprises again and again.
