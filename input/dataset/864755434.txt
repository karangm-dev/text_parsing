We were there in the morning on a Saturday, the line for the place stretched around it and back to the elevators. Clearly 45 minutes. This is sort of a fast food situation, not a sit down restaurant, and by that I mean you buy the food and fight for a place to eat at a very few seating options. I'm sure the food is good based on these reviews, but don't make a special trip to go here if you are in the area, like we did. We ended up going somewhere else. No eggsluttiness for us, unfortunately.
