This belated thank you is inspired by an recent unpleasant visit with my young daughter to a competitor. Beware- There is a difference!!!!!!!!!!!!Physiotherapy and Associates on Broadway has helped me through four surgeries. From my first rotator cuff surgery in 1997 through my labrum tear in 2015 I have felt valued and cared for every time. Much of the staff has remained the same over the years, providing an environment with a delicate balance of motivation and empathy. A warm thank you to the therapists who do the detailed body work, the technicians who guide you through the exercises and the especially the management who keep smiles on faces in a work place where pain and discomfort are fought with care and concern.Well done Physio!
