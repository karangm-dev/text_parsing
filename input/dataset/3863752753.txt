By far the worst salon I have ever been to. I went here asked for balyage and later I got orange hair with spots. paid a ton of money and decided to wait till my next apt with another stylist to get it fixed. She said she would fix it and during the process used the wrong toner and it turned my hair one color. She then had to ask another stylist how to fix it after she apologized and they decided to strip it out!!! I was so upset because it is not good for your hair.Then she had to use another toner and 4 hours later my hair was the exact same as I came in. I talked to the salon manager and she was very rude and said I still had to pay for everything. This place is outrageous and they don't care about your hair at all they just try to get a ton of people in and charge you outrageous prices. I went home crying and called back to see if I can come in another day to get it fixed and they told me I had pay for the products to get it fixed after I paid so much in the first place. Please if you want to save your hair and bank account do not go here! Find a place that listens, doesn't schedule a ton of people at the same time and charge you double. GO TO A SALON THAT WONT CHARGE YOU FOR THEIR SCREW UPS!
