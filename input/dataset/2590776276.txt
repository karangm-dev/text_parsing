Just moved to this part of the Valley and assumed all Fry's were pretty comparable...nope. This is by far the worst one I've ever shopped in. Older building, really bad fluorescent lighting that hummed throughout the store, small deli, even smaller bakery and only one checkout lane open. I will be driving the extra 2.4 miles to avoid this place.
