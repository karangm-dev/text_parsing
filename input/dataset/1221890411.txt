The only good things I can say is that they did come fast and they were polite while taking advantage of first time home owners in their 20s. Our upstairs fan unit went out and while searching for who was open on a Sunday morning I gave them a try, we just thought we needed some more freon. So they come out and tell us the fan motor is broken $900 to fix and our compressor could break soon too since 13 year old units are "very old and units only last 12-15 years" so start saying we should consider replacing which is around $4,500-7,000 for more basic models. Well with that kind of money OF COURSE we're getting a second opinion which we tell them. So we get Horne heating and cooling to come (amazing service and honest) they quote  us $450 for the fan motor and say as long as we keep our units maintained they could last up to 20+ years and definitely didn't need to start considering new units yet. So from the experience I learned that One Hour just wants to use scare tactics on what they assume to be gullible people and mark up their prices on parts/labor. We will not be calling them again!
