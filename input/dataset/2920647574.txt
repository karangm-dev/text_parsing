Quality of food is beyond compare. You are getting authentic Andhra food with the gongura fare just about a notch short of burning you to cinders. I would endure the long waits and complete lack of coordination just to taste their food. But I hope they improve their service level as, clearly, it has piqued everyone's taste buds in the GTA with people coming from all over for the southern delicacies!
