Ok! so, the price on the menu board doesn't match with the price that I've been charged, the amount of food was good but I noticed a piece of metal in the Taboli plate, where did it come from, i think from the dish washing materials, so I went to report the problem and all what i got is an angry face from the owner that does most of the stuff usually and I even saw him earlier standing with his shoes on the dining table to fix the ceiling fan, and finally I wasn't impressed with the way they deal with customers and they charged me for water also.
