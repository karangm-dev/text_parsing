Read reviews. It seemed like a good idea to drive across town for these guys. Boy was I mistaken! They were overpriced by like $20 for an iPhone screen repair. Asked them if they would meet a competitor pricing and they refused twice. Ok cool buddy. So I took my business to Gogadget on Decatur. If you want reasonable prices you can afford and fast and friendly service with the customer in mind. Go to them instead you won't be disappointed!!
