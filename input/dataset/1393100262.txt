I've never called a place that didn't want to help me as much as this place. I called because I wanted to hear from a real employee why they like their product and I was just referred to the website... After I expressed why the website wasn't where I wanted to get my information he didn't even know what to say... Never offered for me to come in and look at the place which I was actually on my way to check out. I was ultimately "dismissed". Such a bummer.
