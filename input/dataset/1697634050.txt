They opened 10 days ago.  Maybe too soon.  I felt like a guinea pig.  My room was great, except the half-opened boxes filled with window fixtures.  So the lamps didn't have lightbulbs...? I had a migraine anyway.  My second room was better, except the repeated problems with the TV that only the maintenance people could fix.  Two visits.  I learned to not turn the TV off.  It would never be the same.It's a nice Hampton Inn.  They have free On-Demand channels.  They don't have the free amenities, if you left something.  Maybe they're in a box in a room that hasn't been reserved yet.  Anyway, Andre and Kelly were helpful front desk clerks.  And I'd stay here again, once they work out the kinks.
