Ling & Louie, hmmm, I'm having a bit of hard time to define this place. The menu serves a wide range of Asian foods, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai and Vietnamese (from my first glance of the dishes and its names), then there is a full bar, Happy Hour menu such as Asian fusion 'flatbread' and 'tacos', it just made me more confused, a place serves many kinds of Asian food but nothing is specialized? Just because you put a description of 'asian sauce', makes a taco Chinese? Then there is this interesting looking clock on the wall next to the kitchen, a clock consists '12' on the top as normal, but the rest numbers are replace by a '5', that just made you start singing, 'it is five o'clock somewhere', and 'let's drink'! So yeah, this is a bar with many kinds of Asian fusion foods. Do not come if you are craving for a more authentic asian cuisine, that was my mistake, yeah...
