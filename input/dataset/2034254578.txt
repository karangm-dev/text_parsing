We went in for dinner last night with my in-laws. This is the third time we've been to Namaste India Garden. First time was with my parents for my dad's birthday, then we came back with some friends, and then last night. My family and I used to frequent Udupi Cafe in Parma, and when they closed we were so sad because we couldn't find any comparable South Indian food in the city. We have found our replacement!!! Namaste is at least as good as Udupi! If not better! Everyone we have brought here loved it as much as myself and my husband do!! The staff is so wonderful, welcoming and attentive. The decor is beautiful and simple enough for a casual dinner, but nice enough for a Saturday night out. One of the owners, Ramesh, has been so welcoming every time and always has recommendations or answers to our questions, or just friendly conversation. Best of all, every single item we've ordered was delicious!! Depth of flavor, plenty of heat, all the best things about South Indian cuisine! I highly recommend everyone pay a visit to our new favorite Indian restaurant
