The place looks very run down. In fact I would have never come in if it wasn't for the fact someone else brought me. As a matter of fact I have been by this place 100's of time and never looked twice. Speaking of I bet they loose a lot of business from folks like me who pass by and don't look twice. Once you are in the inside looks just as bad as outside. However, prices are reasonable, service is always friendly and food is fresh. I have been back several times since my first time and I am sure I will be back some more in the future. You might want to check your glass though as mines had lipstick on it once! Ewwww
