Visited their kiosk location in Scottsdale fashion square mall this evening after dinner. Purchased two cupcakes, one was a red velvet cupcake the other was an Oreo cupcake. The red velvet cupcake was quite moist, fresh, and delicious. The Oreo cupcake on the other hand was dry and tasted as though it had been there for a couple days. At over four dollars a cupcake I really expected much better than we received.  They had many other flavors to choose from; however, based on the experience I had with the Oreo cupcake they've lost my trust.
