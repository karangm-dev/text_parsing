This place is absolute Nirvana for a pinball lover.  It's got everything: dozens of classic mechanical machines to all the latest tables.  It's got a great selection of the best machines, like The Twilight Zone, Medieval Madness, Monster Bash, ST:TNG, Indiana Jones the Pinball Adventure, The Addams Family... I could go on and on. And the most impressive thing is that almost all of them are in good repair.  It's got to be hard to keep such a big inventory of complex machines working properly, so kudos to the staff.
