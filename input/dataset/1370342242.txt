Food okay, service is excellent.  The two major turnoffs are the flock of pigeons that swarm once a table has left, very unappealing and the $44 pitcher of margaritas.  Yes, you read that right 44 dollars for a Cadillac margarita pitcher.  When we asked the bartender what he used, he replied "at least four or five shots". Ah well, live and learn, I just wanted to warn others.
