I am obsessed with eggs. I can have it anytime of day. And I especially love ANY hot sauce with my eggs. Unfortunately, this place doesn't even have it as an option. Like, nothing. A little too confident/cocky with their recipes if they don't want to accommodate customers' personal preferences. Kinda rude. Not impressed. Sorry.
