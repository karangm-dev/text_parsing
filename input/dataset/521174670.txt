This experience was amazing. I recently went on a date here and the atmosphere was very lovely. The hostesses were very accommodating as well as our awesome server Christian. He helped make the night special and I am glad he got to wait on us! The food was far more than I expected and I have to say I was indeed impressed. I highly recommend for a great night out!
