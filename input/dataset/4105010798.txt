My boyfriend and I were visiting Montreal from New York and read about this place so decided to check it out. We wanted to get the poutine but didn't realize they only serve it after a certain time. So we ended up getting their lamb sliders and fries and they were delicious. If I'm ever in Montreal again I'd definitely go back. Still wishing we had been able to try their poutine.
