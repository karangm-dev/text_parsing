Worst business that I had to deal with in the last ten years!I brought my van on a Saturday morning for a repair and they said that they can't work on it and I can make an appointment for another day. So I made the appointment for the following Saturday at 10: AM because this is a work van and I can't leave it at the shop on week days. All it needed were oil change and couple of things checked and hopefully repaired. I showed up for my appointment left the van with them and left about my business. I was waiting all day for a call from them but nothing. Around 3:00 PM, I decided to stop by and check what's with the van. I was surprise to find that they already left for the weekend, the van untouched and the keys are locked inside the shop (now I can't work with the van). I was lucky that the owner showed up and let me take my keys. Even after that they never had the courtesy to call back or anything like they don't care. I will never set foot in this place again.
