At the weekday prices, this buffet is as good as it gets.  I probably would give it a 4 if I had to pay weekend prices. We went here for late lunch on a Tuesday. I suppose if we'd stayed another half hour after we finished our meal we could have gotten some of the dinner food as well, but to be honest I was so incredibly full at that point that I couldn't eat another bite.  In fact, I stayed full until late the  next morning.  And I didn't even get to a number of things this place had to offer. By far the most impressive part of the buffet was the multitude of fish courses (both cold and hot) and the sushi bar that included hand rolls.  The sushi for lunch was generally standard, but the hand rolls and spring rolls were really delicious. There were at least five different types of cooked fish courses, all executed remarkably well for a buffet. Other favorites were the sweet potato puree (pure heaven) and the creamy polenta. The sliders were surprisingly excellent, although the lamb and flank steak I tried were nothing special.  The cooked vegetables at this buffet are executed really well.  Not mushy or dried out.  The green beans and grilled asparagus were particularly good. Even the pizza here was decent and everyone knows how bad pizza can get at a buffet! The only thing that was a bit disappointing here (and only a bit) were the desserts.  I have definitely had better desserts at a buffet before.  For the most part they were really your standard mini desserts with not much flavor.  But even here there were a couple of excellent standouts.  The bread pudding was delicious (and bread pudding can be really dry) and the pumpkin cheesecake was amazing.  My husband was really impressed especially since it was under $20.  A good thing since it was his special birthday meal!
