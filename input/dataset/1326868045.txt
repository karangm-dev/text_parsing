Not impressed at all by the bagels, they have no flavor, and are very doughy.  Lines are very long, fairly disorganized. Not impressed at all. I know the bagels are not supposed to be like Montreal bagels. I was hopping for a great bagel, but these fall way short. I wouldn't be going back anytime soon.
