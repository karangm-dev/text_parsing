My boyfriend and I went here for dinner evening and all I can say is it was awesome. Be prepared the drinks are powerful here and we made the mistake of getting Tequila shots on the side..but the frozen Margarita house drinks did not need it. Needless to say we took our time drinking and eating so we could travel home safely. Fantastic time...we will definitely visit this restaurant again... by the way ... I had the chicken shrimp and spinach entree and John had the mahi-mahi tacos... so good!
