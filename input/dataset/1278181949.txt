Service: excellent.Food: far behind all the other Indian places in the city.We had a Groupon for this place.  We had been to their other location on Bloor and the food was good there, but the food here tastes far different and not nearly as good as their Bloor location.Appetizer: AssortedMains: Butter chicken, lamb ghostDesserts: Ras Malai, kulfi.It's not awful or the worst or "bad", but Indian in Toronto has high standards.  Gotta keep up with the Joneses.
