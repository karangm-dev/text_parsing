I was selling some jewelry I called this place of business and the owner was extremely polite and very helpful and generous with his knowledge I then arrived ...he appraise my jewelry and gave me some tips as to how to sell it if I didn't want to sell it to him.... this was a pleasant experience for someone in the vulnerable position of selling jewels.. I would definitely shop here again and refer any friends and family to this business...
