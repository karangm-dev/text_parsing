How do these people stay in business? Their place is never open. I have been here once before and bought a really cute dress that was a little over priced and a great deal on a pair of shorts that I pretty much wear every day. Since that time, every time I have a chance to get over there, they are closed. They have the weirdest hours for a clothing store I have ever seen. Oh well there are plenty of others -_-
