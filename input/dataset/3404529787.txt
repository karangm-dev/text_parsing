Iso I was involved in a vehicle accident last night and needed a tow.  The metro officer recommend 2 places to call...Quality or Ewing.  He leaned towards Ewing Bro's so I gave them a call.  They stated 85 over the phone and since I was less than three miles away it brought the total to 93.00.  The guy got there pretty quick and he was very friendly and even helped to pull the wheel well so the vehicle could be pulled into the garage after he took it to the house.  The only sour point I experienced over the whole transaction is when I gave the guy a 100 dollar bill....he stated he didn't have any change.  Im thinking.....are you serious?  I was planning on tipping him 20 buck for helping me with my classic truck and then he pulled that stunt.  I just told him to keep the 7 bucks.  He saved me 13 dollars.  So word to the wise when you are dealing with this company....either have exact change or use a credit card.
