This is the best barbecue in Phoenix. The brisket is consistent with the best that you would find in Austin Texas. The beans are coupled with a lot of meat and would be a great meal by themselves. The jalape√±o cheese grits are perfect comfort food. Their brisket will change your expectations on how meat should taste. They will serve fatty or lean or combo. Both are unbelievable.
