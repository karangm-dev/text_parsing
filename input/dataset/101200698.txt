Meh.Compared to a lot of other bubble tea houses, this hasn't raised the bar, or given me an experience worth going back for. I ordered the hot taro tea, and it was great, a little too sweet for my taste though.The decor itself is nice, unique, themed on One Piece. Which is nice! I'm a huge fan of One Piece! Tea is great, decor is great, it was the customer service that made me pack my bags and never look back.My boyfriend and I were sat in a dingy corner. It was INCREDIBLY loud (which is okay really for a bubble tea house), but it felt almost as if the owners knew all the customers there. I think it was more of a 'Friend Hangout' then anything. Because my boyfriend and I were being eyed down weirdly making us feel like 'Outsiders.' Our server was too busy chit chatting with her friends, and we waited a good 15 minutes for our order to be taken when she finally found the will to pull away from her friends. When she took our order, it was like she was dreading it, and had other better things to do. The tea got out to us quickly, and like I said, it was good quality. But it lacked customer service.It's a little small in there, but honestly ... If they changed their customer service, I can see this place being a hit! Though, I don't see myself going back there anytime soon.
