Soooo this is a new one on me, 30 min wait when half the place is empty this place has dropped off the map in my book as of late. the food has went from excellent to okay. The service has never been up to par but they try to make up for it by giving away free desserts. Which is fine but I would rather get great service and that always makes the food taste better get a grip you guys and tighten it up:0
