this is my first time ordering from this place. The only real positive I have is that the delivery came fast. Other than that- No. 1. The delivery guy didn't have any change. WHAT DELIVERY PERSON DOESN"T CARRY CHANGE??? I can't pay with my credit card so what do you expect from me? I should've been called before the order was made. Luckily I had a ton of quarters which meant I had to leave the guy leave standing outside my door while i went scrounging. He had a very bad attitude too. 2. I ordered a sesame chicken lunch special. the chicken was so tough it was inedible. I had one or two pieces but it wasn't worth the calories OR THE MONEY. 3. This place is not cheap. I have had way better, way cheaper chinese food. 4. I requested chopsticks. Keep in mind i ordered online so my request was printed on the reciept order. (I know bc I've used that website to order food before). I didn't get one pair of chopsticks. 5. I also ordered steamed pork dumplings. Half were over cooked. The other half were VERY pink inside. Inedible and even when I took a bite tasted raw. Positives:1. fast delivery2. cute takeout containers. overall: never ordering from this place again.
