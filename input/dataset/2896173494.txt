Dr. Bang is by far the best chiropractor I've ever been to. Most chiropractors just crack all your joints and call it a day, but Dr. Bang believes chiropractics is not just about cracking bones. He finds the movement and alignment through other stimulation's such as heat therapy, electricity, and a couple other devices. We actually didn't start adjusting joints until my 4th visit! Every session I feel a lot better, he runs the facility by himself so when you come in it's a personable experience all around. Highly recommend!
