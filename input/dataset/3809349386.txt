This is by far my favorite sushi place in Markham! I always stop there after my workouts. Salmon Hosomaki is a must order for me. Its $3 and they are very generous with the fish portion! Ai Sushi rolls is delicious and a chef's special there, it's unlike other! However, depending on what you order, it can get very pricey.
