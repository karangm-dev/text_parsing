One of favorite places. A seriously wonderful place. The crepes are wonderfuly thin and tasty. Go early otherwise it gets pretty busy. The food is simple but so fresh and clean. Mostly breakfast items. The smokey is my favorite and my wife loves the First Time. There coffee is experty done with multiple methods, french press, aero press, expresso or drip. We try to go every weekend. :) WE LOVE THIS PLACE!
