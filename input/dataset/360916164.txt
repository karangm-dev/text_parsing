Let's see, where to start...-There is always equipment that is out of order.-Zero response from the management to customer concerns.-Useless water aerobics classes taking up valuable pool space. Also, the pool is sold to swim classes (so unavailable to use) 4 or 5 days a week.-No coed sauna, come on!On the plus-side, the shakes are good!
