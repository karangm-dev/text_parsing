Cool place ! I fell in love with the chicken teriyaki samba style so incredibly tasteful ! Im a Maine lobster addict so I tried the samba strip and it was equally amazing ! I love how the staff was incredibly accommodating , I walked in my brother and his gf already had a table and the staff moved us to a bigger table! Next time I will def come back for more chicken teriyaki samba style and I won't share it lol
