My family goes there or gets take out two or three times a month.When we go we order the following every time:Goodfella(just cheese) and add pepperoni and sausage.Goodfella and add pepperoni, carmelized onions, garlic, mushrooms, and extra cheese.Fresh Mozzarella and Tomato (Caprese)Every other time we're there we order the Stuffed Shrimp.Every couple times we order the pizzas and the Chicken Marsala. Every time, every thing we order is great! The pizzas are fantastic. Ours have always had the perfect amount of toppings, baked just right and piping hot.  The caprese is very good with tomatoes that are consistently good. The shrimp and its stuffing are terrific. The chicken and accompanying sauce are really tasty.The service is good, sometimes better than good, but nothing I'd ever consider rude or poor service. One of the servers is a bit more mellow than the rest and the dry sense of humor may put someone off, but I enjoy it.The only recommendation I have for them is better balsamic vinegar for the caprese. Yes, I do use 30-40 year old vinegar at home and no, I don't expect them to serve it. Since I know there are good quality grocery store brands that can be reduced to make a better tasting balsamic, I would like to see them find something better. Yes, I have recommended it, but I've never had Justins ear for that.
