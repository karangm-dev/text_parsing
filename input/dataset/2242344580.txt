I have been a member of the Strongsville Rec Center for two years.  I have to say that it has gone down hill dramatically in that time period.  When a piece of equipment is broken it does not get fixed for over a month.  Staff simply hangs a sign on it and then there is no communication as to when it will be fixed or replaced.  I have addressed this concern, only to be given a lame excuse that it takes time to get a repair person out and then time to get parts.  For what this rec center charges for membership, a repair person with the replacement parts should be out within a week.  No excuse in this day and age not to repair equipment promptly.  Towels to wipe machines down after use are often completely saturated and gross to touch.  I wish I had not renewed this membership.
