Listen, the food here is great. The employees very attentive and nice. My problem is the absolutely ridiculous side charges for something that should be a part of the meal. $10.95 for a lunch of meatloaf I can live with, what is a normal side with meatloaf? Why yes mashed potatoes, well if you want that here it's $2.95 extra so now we are at basically $14.00 for lunch. Get my meal and its a little tiny, tiny bowl of potatoes, ugh, ask if I could have some gravy for the potatoes was told sure but thats $1.00 extra. Are  you kidding me. Absolutely crazy. Will certainly reconsider ever going here again. It's like booking an airline flight where you have to pay extra for everything.
