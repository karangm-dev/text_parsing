Meager at best. Will never eat here again. First of all they tell you beer and wine is included with your meal (with a nice selection of imports in the trophy case behind the register). Only to find out all they serve is bud light from a keg and a white and red wine from (presumably) a box. THAT REALLY PISSED ME OFF - if I Hadn't paid first I would have left.Next, the food was not particularly good. the carving station had some decent meats, but much was over-cooked and dry. There was a fishy funk by the seafood that make me leery of even trying the cooked shrimp. - much less the sushi and raw oysters.That's my two cents - getting mad all over again thinking of what to write, so I'll stop now.
