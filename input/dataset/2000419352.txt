BEST GELATO EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!We of coursed Yelped this spot since we didn't wanna spend $10 on a teeny scoop of gelato somewhere along the strip.This place is located in somewhat of a questionable neighborhood. We originally wanted to get some custard across the street from this spot but that place looked janky and scary so we popped over here and thank God we did too!The owner literally made us try every single flavor before ordering. She explained to us how she makes her gelato flavors fresh every morning and everything is made with natural ingredients. And I believe it! The banana flavor tasted like you were literally eating a spruced up banana. The most interesting flavor I tried was the dark chocolate with hot peppers (you get the kick of spice right down your throat, soooo cool!) I was literally FULL after trying ALL the flavors so I had to go for a mini scoop of the Avocado gelato. And boy was that delish and totally hit the spot!If you're craving some homemade gelato THIS is the THE SPOT to hit up while in Vegas. We'll be back here every time we're in this city for sure!
