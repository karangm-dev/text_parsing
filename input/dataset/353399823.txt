I've had good and bad interactions with realtors over the years and it makes a huge difference in the home buying experience.  After going on house hunts with half a dozen other realtors in Calgary, I ended up with Royal Lepage Foothills on a recommendation and they've been fantastic.  I've been given upfront advice and in some cases was told NOT to buy because a better deal could be had if we waited on timing.  I'd recommend RLFoothills (and have done) to my friends and colleagues.
