Marigold Maison is my girlfriend and i's absolute favorite Indian restaurant in the valley. We live very close to the PV Mall area, so we frequent as often as we can. We have tried the majority of vegetarian curries and have enjoyed all of them wholeheartedly. My girlfriend is obsessed with the classic saag paneer, and I can't get enough of the amazing kofta. The samosa and the dosas are very delicious as well! I don't think there has been a time we haven't ordered the saag or the samosa. We've also had their veg lunch special w/ 2 varying curries, rice, naan, and misc dessert. Very filling! There is something for everyone here! They recently expanded - lots of seating and a new fancy bar area. Unfortunately caused a spike in menu prices, but well worth the little extra $! Servers are very friendly and always accommodating to large groups.Both of our hearts and tummys are so happy after we come here! It's so good we bring visiting family, friends, and couchsurfers here! My mouth is watering as I write this review!! *4/5 vegetarian friendly! Tons of delicious options!
