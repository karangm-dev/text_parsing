We walked in at 10:40 and sat at a table right next to the bar. Waiters and waitresses walked past us repeatedly and we finally went up to the bar to get our drinks. At 11:02 I went back up to the bar to inquire about getting food and was told they stopped serving at 11 to which I replied to the bartender that we had been sitting at a table right across from her for 20 minutes. She called out somebody's name and I told her not to worry about it cuz I was so pissed off with her attitude she also mentioned that they are not a 2 a.m. bar, and with her attitude I could see why. The owner or manager came over a few minutes later and offered to buy us a shot for our troubles. At first we said no but then we were like screw it. I doubt I will give this place a second chance as it was obvious the waiters and waitresses did not want to serve us. They did wait on a table directly behind us and quickly got them menus and served them. Just overall crappy service.
