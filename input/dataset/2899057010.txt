The black sesame ice cream on the AYCE menu is a pleasant surprise. The rest is a big pile of meh. The rice is pretty terrible. We went for a second round and included the ice cream (red bean and sesame) on the tick sheet. Oddly the ice cream came first before the sushi items. Hmmm. Lots of AYCE sushi places don't have the most brilliant ability to get ordered items to your actual table. We weren't sure if our second round of sushi choices ended up in AYCE purgatory so we started in on the sesame ice cream. It's a bit of an odd taste at the start but smooths out in a creamy delight as it melts in your mouth.
