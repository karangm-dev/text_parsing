Very unhappy with my experience. I came in with my brother to pick up our two photos. We waited about 30 minutes. It was a photo of our grandma and one of the photos had a mark on her face that was not supposed to be there. I had to come back again with my mom another day. We waited about 40 minutes and the manager said, "sorry I was stuck in traffic." The manager said she brought 3 photos for us but one of them was the original photo that was messed up so we got exactly what we paid for. I just don't think it's acceptable that the manager did not apologize for the mark on the photo and that the manager did not do anything to make up for her mistake and my wasted time. If you're going to source your printing to an outside vendor, check the photos before you give them to your customers. She clearly does not understand customer service.
