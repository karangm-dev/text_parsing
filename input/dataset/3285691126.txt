I am having a difficult time getting an appointment with the Surgeon I was referred to.  It's difficult scheduling an appointment.  I spoke to April who schedules appointments, but when she would ask one question and I was ready ready to answer she asked me two more.  I'm not alone with my review.  It's reasonable to expect  to talk to someone who is compassionate and whom will return your calls.  I'm disappointed.  I'm not their only patient in need of care.  I hear the Doctors at MD Anderson Cancer Center are great.  It's the difficulty in getting an appointment scheduled. I'm confident I'll get good care from my Doctor at MD Anderson when my Doctor's office and myself navigate their requirements.  I give two stars for the process and staff you need to deal with to get an appointment.   Again, the Doctor I will be seeing gets outstanding reviews.
