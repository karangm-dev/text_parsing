If I could give negative stars I would!!! This place is just AWFUL with the poorest selection I have ever seen with a buffet!  Especially in Vegas!!My granddaughter had a modeling shoot in Vegas during WPPI. The shoot was over a bit late so we wanted a buffet close to the hotel and it was already 8:30 pm. We decided to walk over to the MGM. The food selection was horrible. The salad bar was a joke. There wasn't even one chocolate dessert for the kids. Not to mention it was 30.00 for the adults and a 5 yr old was 20.00! There wasn't even chicken for her to eat,  so it cost me 20.00 for an ice cream cone because there was seriously such a terrible selection of food!! I ate maybe 5.00 worth myself! Horrible just horrible!! Home Town Buffet looked like a high class buffet compared to this garbage! I would NEVER EVER go here nor recommend this place!!  EVER!!! Biggest waste of 120.00 I have ever spent!  I would have expected much more from the MGM. Soooo terribly disappointed!!
