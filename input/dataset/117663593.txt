Just wanted to do a quick update on previous review. As I said before I appreciated the amount of knowledge everyone here had and that is why I went back. Every experience I have had at Halo since has been amazing. They are so knowledgeable and willing to answer all my questions and never get frustrated if I ask silly questions or want something reexplained. The quality of the jewelry, the staff and the business as a whole is amazing and I tell everyone I know to go here.
