Laptop went in with a broken trackpad and came out with a broken display and logic board, each of which never had prior issues.  They claimed both failures were my fault and refused to do any repairs until I paid $1400, even though the original work was covered by warranty.  Their conceited employees also made me feel like I was an annoyance for simply being in their business and did the bare minimum throughout my entire experience.
