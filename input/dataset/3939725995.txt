I'm not a big Starbucks fan but I have a gift card from work and it'll do in a pinch. The drive thru line wrapped all through the parking lot so I parked and went inside. The staff was courteous and I just had a plain coffee. The other clientele I found to be pretty snotty self entitled yuppies. In the parking lot, I almost get hit by some guy rushing through. I start backing out and this guy jumps in his sports car slams it into reverse and almost hits another car and leans on his horn!!! Anyways, it's been awhile since I've been to a Starbucks and now I remember why.
