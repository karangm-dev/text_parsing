Went to try and rent a storage unit at this place asked upfront about cost. Was quoted my cost for renting from the place period was shown a dirty storage unit with broken down cars in the parking lot. Kyle who works there is quite fat and lazy not interested in cleaning storage units. He also engaged in bait and switch sales tactics has taught to him by his corporate overlords. After spending 15 minutes at the place watching and help other customers instead of me(despite me arriving first) and finally getting down to renting the storage unit despite overlooking all the problems with the place he then let me know that they charged a compulsory insurance premium not closer to me up front. He also admitted to me that the facility security system was difficult to use and often not effective.AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
