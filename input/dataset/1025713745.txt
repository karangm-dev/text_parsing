The store that brought quick access to every product needed for the local tech community has not lost its mind. As a local small business we lived here. We purchased everything from the store. I have great friends here. We would even come for lunch regularly as it was just a great place.They have turned their backs on the local vendors. Some ass hat here has decided that as a reseller I need to provide my entire team copies of our tax documentation and provide it each and every time we purchase. WHAT?!? Seriously? Yup. Pretty dumb. There's no reason and we even contacted corporate and they stated it's a local store decision. Well we have decided to jump ship and move our business over to Amazon who has been providing quick delivery and supporting my reseller status. Have a good one Fry's. You are really kicking at the guys that support you.
