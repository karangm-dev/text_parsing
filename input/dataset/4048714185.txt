After purchasing a microneedling package I attempted to schedule an appointment on a Saturday (the only day I could make it in). They are very limited and only open one Saturday a month. After trying for SIX plus month I decided to just throw them away! I was put on a cancellation list and never called back and once I was scheduled, they called me 30 minutes before my appointment to cancel! Really crummy customer service -- I was told they do not do refunds!!! Not going back.
