My feet have been killing me. I don't know why. I was planning to go to Healing Touch Reflexology across the street since I've been there before but went to this place since I was already at the shopping center for something else. Now I regret it. OK these people don't speak English well. I get that, but they need to find a way to communicate with you to let you know they're going to snap off your bra and pull your pants half way down to massage your back. Very weird!! My biggest disappointment was that it was hardly a massage on my feet, which I needed the most. She just lightly rubbed them. I should've just driven across the street to Healing Touch because they get the job done. See you soon Healing Touch!!
