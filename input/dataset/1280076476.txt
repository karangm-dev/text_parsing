Red Robin is hopping on a Friday night...service was great. Go Matt!  Attentive, friendly, and efficient. Our burgers were delicious and those fries are the best.  I had the DGB ...I heard music with the first bite.  What a wonderful combination of favors.  My son had the Royal burger and the egg was beautiful.  He complained that the bacon tasted like microwave bacon....but managed to eat every bite.  Red Robin....hummmmmm
