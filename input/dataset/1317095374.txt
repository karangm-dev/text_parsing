Love sushi and great service? ? Well this place is perfect for that.  Unpretentious,  delicious super relaxed atmosphere.  Went here for lunch after someone recommended it.  The to go boxes are yummy,  my fav was the purple looking roll with crunchy stuff on top of it.  We got complimentary soup, adamame and ice cream. The service was superb!
