My friend and I decided Applebee's would be the place for lunch.  Been a lot of places to eat in my life, but the manager "Benjamin" at the restaurant impressed me.  Most places when you say you would like to move, because the area where you are sitting is to cold.  Back to your vehicle to get a sweater or  you move to another section.  No, he told us to stay where we were and in about 3mins we would feel a difference.  Not only did he do that, but he came back later and sat with us for a few moments to see if we were okay.  Job well done Sir.  Liked that waiter let us know that they were a little busy, it would be just a little bit for the food, but it didn't really take that long.  When we did received our food,  it was hot and delicious.  I would definitely go back to this particular Applebee's!
