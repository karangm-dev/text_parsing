Went on a Sunday AM. Ordered 4 crepes to go and the waiter brings them to me as an eat in order. No big deal, mistakes happen. Then he asks where my table was. "Nowhere, I wasn't planning on eating here." He then blames the girl at the counter for the mix up and says that he can't make the orders to go so he'll bring me some foil to wrap them myself, all while giving me a very smug attitude like this is my fault and I'm being such an inconvenience to him. The crepes were good but I'm not about to deal with that attitude again. If I had an employee like that I'd fire him on the spot.
