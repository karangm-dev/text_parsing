I have been going to North Scottsdale Laser & Skin Care for about 3 years now and extremely happy with the results!  Dr Anderson does my treatments and I find she has great input without coming across like she is trying to sell me more product than I need.  The staff is always friendly and I am always dressed very casual as I usually go when I am not in business attire.
