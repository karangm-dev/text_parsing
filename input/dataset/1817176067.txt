Used to be a staple on Carson but has really disappointed over the last few years. Still a pretty good meal but the service and flair are completely gone. The hibachi used to be so entertaining but now it's basically just watching someone awkwardly cook for you. Sushi is tasty but no options that really stand out. Table service is usually not great and the bartenders seem to use their phones more than mixing tins. Still a place I will go every now and again but there are many better options for this type of fare around the city.
