We come here once in a while mostly for special occasions or when we really crave it , so we went for dinner last night , and we ordered the calamari I had two pieces of it on my third one I found a long black hair fried into the calamari , we finally got our servers attention after about 15 min . He called the manager who just came over and looked irritated he just said we will switch it out no sorry's or anything . We finally got the calamari after our entres and almost at the end of the meal so what's the point of that "appetizer" .So we got our entrees I ordered a steak Diane and our server didn't brother to bring a steak knife until my husband finally flagged him down again and he looked irritated, we also got the shrimp scampi which didn't come with the angel pasta as so that's what our server told us I looked up in the website and it clearly says its served with angel pasta and our server just said oh it's separate and left quickly. Seemed like he didn't want to serve us , me and my husband are pretty young we are 23 and maybe he thought we wouldn't leave him a good tip but we always do when we dine out . Very disappointed with our meal and the service it sucks  because we really enjoyed coming here .We paid almost $70 for a meal that was all messed up .
