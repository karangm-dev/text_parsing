This car rental place is horrible. We reserved the car on Expedia and the total was $280. When we returned the car they added in an extra $200 for what was the extra driver. I've never been charged for an extra driver. The car had a horrible ear piercing sound in the upper right window area and when we reported it they said they took note but did nothing about it. I will never rent from this place again and will stick with Enterprise who actually cares about the customer experience instead of ripping off the consumer. #Paylesscarrentalyousuck
