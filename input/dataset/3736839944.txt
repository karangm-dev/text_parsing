When I went into the store the first time, the sales associate was friendly, helpful, the store was clean and organized. I ordered the Adel desk, it came a week later to the store where I went to pick it up. When I went to go pick it up, the man brought out the giant boxes containing the desk from the storage room. I am a petit young woman, but assumed that I would be fine carrying everything to my car with the help of the staff. But I guess that's where their services end because after that they just handed me a fridge cart and the only help offered was to open the door as I struggled to wheel out a box that was twice my weight in the rain by myself as 5 sales associates stood around and watched. Then when I finally got home and brought it into my place and tried to assemble it, one of the pieces was too short causing there to be a noticeable gap. I wasn't about to lug it back to the store after the ordeal I just had getting it to my place, so I managed to force it together with some help. All in all, I am a bit dissapointed with my experience.
