My daughter attended this dojo for a couple of months (little ninjas). She was often left out, Sensei never got her name right, communication was horrible, his patience with kids is short. I often followed him in right as class was starting, he never held the door open for me. They had a guest speaker one time (which I donated  $20 for) the speaker looked and acted like a drunk. For some reason the speaker had an Olympic ring. Sensei Joe was walking around to every parent showing the ring. Once it became my turn to see it, I held my hand out, he completely skipped over me, didn't even look at me and went on to the next parent. Disrespectful, no mannerisms, horrible business owner, rude to my child. We never showed up again. Don't wasn't your time or money.
