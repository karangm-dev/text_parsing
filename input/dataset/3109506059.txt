I love this class! My son's development and interaction with others has taken off since he started a little over a month ago. Every class he does a little more than the last. Sue is a great teacher. She's great at making it fun while helping them to learn self control and patience. Someone else commented on the condition of the puppets and parachute; yeah they are a bit crusty and probably could be cleaned a little better, but I decided to put my germaphobe fears aside for my child's development. Even if he gets a cold or two from class (which he hasn't after 5 weeks) that seems to be par for the course when it comes to interacting with other children and the benefits to his development outweigh a few sniffles in my opinion!
