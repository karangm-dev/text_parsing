I ate here twice for breakfast, awesome. Great stuff like sweet plantains, lox and bagels, great cheese selection and a great hispanic foods area. When I was here last week it was $16 including coffee and juices, that is a great bargain. I unfortunately did not get the chance to have dinner here, but if you can eat breakfast here then absolutely do so.
