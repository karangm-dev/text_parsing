I loved love loooooved Joe's. It was so yummy. It was my first time there and I saw Biggie on the menu and knew I had to take one of my friends with me, who enjoyed it as well. The atmosphere flows so well with the design of the place. The food, I ordered a Notorious B.I.G. Burger because I saw all the amazing reviews on it. And I was not disappointed. It had so much flavor and it was so yummy. It was a beautiful night to sit on the patio, which is also dog friendly. Restrooms were clean. The movies playing on the screen were great. The service was a little slow. But they were also really busy and people kept loading in, the food totally made up for it! They definitely did not disappoint. And I will be back!
