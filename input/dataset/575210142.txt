My husband loves the Chicken Enchilada soup and the bottomless chips and salsa here. To recover from a cold and rainy weekend we decided to have a light dinner. After sitting at our booth without acknowledgement from any waitstaff someone finally approached out table. We finally ordered. He ordered the above with a Coke, I ordered a bowl of Loaded Potato Soup with a Mango Iced Tea. Our son ordered the kids Cheeseburger Bites with a bottle of root beer. Drinks took another 10 minutes and were delivered with our chips. Food came out about 10 after that. My rating isn't based on the food, it was tasty  as always, and on par with your average Chili's. The 2 stars is based on service. After dropping off our drinks we never saw our waitress again. A random server brought out our food, which had already started to cool. Another minute and our soups would have been cold. Our waitress never returned to give us drink refills, never returned to see if our food was ok, never returned to see if we needed anything else. We saw her twice. Once when she finally initially greeted us and took our order since after sitting 15 minutes. Once when she dropped off our drinks and bottomless chips. (good thing we didn't need more chips. $7.99 for a basket of chips and a small cup of salsa)I know we only ordered soup but our bill was still $29 without the tip. Thank goodness for the check yourself out kiosk on the table or we probably would still be waiting for our waitress to find her way back to our table.Next time we are in the mood for soup we will go across the street to Panera!
