After buying their smoked meat in a quarter pound for a year, to give my kids, they now refuse to sell a quarter pound.  Manager refused to sell less than a half pound.  My kids don't eat that much.  What trouble is it to this business to sell a quarter pound vs a half?  Poor customer service.  They wouldn't even do it as a one time courtesy. Also I noticed on this recent visit that the back entrance has smelly food grease stains all over the sidewalk.  It stinks! And it stinks so bad that the outdoor seating area smells bad too.  Yuck!! Makes me question the cleanliness of the kitchen to see that mess right outside the back entrance. Otherwise the food is usually pretty good. But customer service now seems to lacking.
