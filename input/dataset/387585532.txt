I love this place. I've been to at least 6 other European wax centers in the valley but this one is the best. The girls at the front desk are always so pleasant & Lizzy the waxer is AMAZING at her job. She is very thorough & takes pride in what she does. Very professional yet enjoyable to be around. I love this Location & even though there are centers closer to my home & work, I will continue to go to this location.
