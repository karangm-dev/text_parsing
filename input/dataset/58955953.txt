Okay, I thought I give this place another chance and I have to say, disappointed once again. I ordered the spicy eggplant lunch special this time.  Was not spicy, had chicken pieces that were cold so I checked to ensure they were cooked thoroughly, and the eggroll was overcooked and dry. The only good thing I got was the Thai iced tea. I can safely say I won't be coming back.
