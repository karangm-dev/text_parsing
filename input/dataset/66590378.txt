Great atmosphere. Organic fair trade coffee was good but no non-dairy option to go with it. Food was decent. The worst part was that our food came like 5 min after ordering and then we got asked to leave soon after because of the line up. Sorry but when people go for brunch they go to hang out. Not eat quickly and leave. I would not go back for brunch for that reason. I would rather wait in line at lady marmalade for 45 min and eat good food.
