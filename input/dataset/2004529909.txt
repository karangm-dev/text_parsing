Never coming here again. Needed a mani pedi before a trip and was short on time. Came here, picked out a color, and everything was fine until she started to paint my nails. The color had been damaged from being stored in the sun. I show her another color (chrome) and apparently they can't do that. So I say what about something similar. She says sure and pulls out the chrome kit. Apparently she just really didn't want to do it. I asked for pink since she couldn't do grey (not sure why that was impossible- they had grey polish and silver chrome). Instead, she uses bright red. Meanwhile she just painted my toes hot pink. The entire time she was talking to two others in Vietnamese which made me super uncomfortable as it was obvious that they wrote talking about me. Finally, when I go to pay, she tells me that she is waiving the $15 chrome up charge. First of all she never told me it was extra, and second of all I've had chrome done other places and I've never been charged extra. Let alone $15. Although I should have gathered seeing as for SNS you don't get a manicure, just a polish change. It is $10 extra just for the manicure. So I guess come here if you want to be gossiped about in Vietnamese and if you want to be nickeled and dimed to death. I'll be going back to my normal place where I'm treated nicely, even if it is a 30 minute drive. It is sad because Tiffany actually does a good job. But the rudeness of the staff overall and the lack of caring about how happy their customers are makes this is no for me.
