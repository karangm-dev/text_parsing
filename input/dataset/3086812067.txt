Was excited to get in on a promotional deal on 7/28 and scheduled the appointment for 7/30.  I was contacted in the afternoon on 7/29 that she had an accident and needed 4 stitches to her right thumb and couldn't do treatments until she got them taken out a week later.  She offered to reschedule for the following Saturday.  Okay...no problem.  She contacted me on Tuesday 8/2 for an opening on Wednesday (obviously back to work sooner than expected.), but I couldn't come and wanted to keep my Saturday appointment.  She contacted me on 8/4 to see if I wanted an earlier appointment on Saturday.  Nope, I have my day scheduled and I wanted to keep my time.  I get a text at 6:44 am (yes I did type that correctly) on 8/6 asking if I could come at 12:00 pm.  GEEZ...alright already, I will rearrange my schedule to get this facial out of the way because it is becoming a nightmare.  I get a text at 11:11 am stating that her thumb isn't doing well and she got back to work too soon and she needs more time healing and asks if we can do the following week.  (You've got to be kidding!  I changed a client, and a lunch appointment to be there at the time she requested.)  She apologized, said I could have two treatments for the price of one and she'd get back to me about the following week.  It's 8/25 and I have never heard from her.  I have no review of the actual service, but customer service is obviously a problem.  My time is just too valuable to be jerked around for a few weeks.
