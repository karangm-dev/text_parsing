We stayed at this hotel for 5 days during a conference and it was a wonderful experience. The location of this place cannot be beat. It is right across the street from Nathan Phillips Square and very close too many attractions such as the CN Tower and Ripley's Aquarium. We also really appreciated the fact that there was a food court in the basement of this hotel. We had lunch several times there and it was very affordable. We had gotten a complimentary upgrade to one of the Cabana Style rooms. It was very spacious with a large coffee table that we used as a dining table on the few times that we ordered in. There was also a fridge in the room which we appreciated. The location of this room was very convenient as we could just take the escalator up from the lobby to get to our floor. We could also walk out to the waterfall Garden from our room. The staff was also very nice and helpful especially the housekeeper who got me and you hair dryer because mine was not working anymore.I would definitely come back and stay here again!
