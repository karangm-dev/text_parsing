My boyfriend had to get a new card just about 3 months ago as his was lost and not only did the card take longer in the mail than they quoted but they also sent it to his old address EVEN THOUGH he clearly gave them his most current address. Thank goodness his father still lives at that address! As of a week ago, we found out that someone must have gotten ahold of his new card # or bank account # as there was a charge on his account from California that wasn't from us and his bank told him HE MAY get reimbursed if investigations prove they weren't from him and a new card would come in 5 business days. So here we are again without money for a week and they didn't even offer to expedite it since they totally fucked up last time. It's now been over 5 business days and when my boyfriend called he was told he may just need to order YET AGAIN another card. My boyfriend told him he can't be doing this as he can't get gas, food, etc. and THE GUY HUNG UP ON HIM! Poor customer service, poor employees, and terrible bank in general. We'll be switching banks now because you guys don't know how to take care of your customers!
