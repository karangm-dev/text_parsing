I am new to Charlotte and was somehow quickly wrangled into a ridiculous legal mess.  I hired Mr. Powers at 4pm on a Friday afternoon.  He learned my entire case over the weekend, defended me in court against a restraining order first thing Monday morning, and we won.It is such a rare combination to find a lawyer with incredible talent who still thinks/works from the heart.  Bill Powers is that man.  He's definitely *earned* every award he has posted in his office!If you have an important or complicated case within his specialty, with the utmost confidence he's your man.   Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.
