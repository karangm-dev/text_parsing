We have been a fan of Roy's for many years whether it's been one of their restaurants in Hawaii, Chicago, or elsewhere.   We have also been to this Roy's at the JW Marriott twice before and have never been disappointed.  However, we went with friends last night and the food was terribly disappointing!  One of their best dishes has always been the butter fish and we looked forward to it all day .... so much so that  3 of us ordered it.  The sauce was too salty and lacked depth and complexity.   It tasted like it was made by an amateur and not up to par with an entree that costs $31.  In fact, it tasted very close to the overly salty teriyaki sauce you get in bottle at the grocery store with cornstarch added to it.  Even the presentation was sloppy.  The cuts of fish were not uniform and thinner than we remember.  Then it was just plopped on a messy glob of Japanese rice that was saturated with that terrible sauce.  The single stem of Shanghai bok choy was lacking a leaf portion.  We know it's only one dish, but it's a signature dish of Roy's and should set the standard for the other dishes.  Hopefully, this  is isolated to this Roy's and not indicative of their other restaurants.
