I was pretty hesitant to try this place out due to the bad reviews. However I figured since the negativity was based around the management/credit card deal and not the services, it might be worth a try. Plus they were able to fit me in last minute.When I walked in I was immediately greeted and taken care of. The facility is really nice and very relaxing. The lighting and decor is perfect to get you de stressed. Amanda my therapist was great. She was very informative about the services and the aromatherapy. She was able to do some great work on my pain points. I got a foot scrub and she was the first person ever that didn't tickle me to death. Amanda was attentive to me and made sure she wasn't too rough. I would recommend her and Massage Heights. The quality I got for a $50 hour was impressive. I will be back!
