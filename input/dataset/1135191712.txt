Service is horifically slow. Been there twice now, and both times orders have been incorrect. Staff is very friendly, but can't keep up with customers needs. Went with a colleague from Indiana, NOT even close to the quality of S&S out there. Manager did come over and offer shakes for compensation, but damage was already done.  Unfortunately will not be be back. Sorry folks.
