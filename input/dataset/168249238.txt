I was in transition moving and don't have a washer yet but came here and did the drop off your laundry and they wash, dry, fold package.  Highly would recommend this place! It is fairly priced. I will be back for my blankets, comforters and loads of laundry when I don't have time for laundry. Thanks for making laundry not so painful!
