Rather disappointed in this location.  The soda machine was out of ice and was not filled after I told them about it, and they did not have any of the vanilla flavoring powder to be able to add vanilla to your iced coffee but the worst thing was the amount of cream cheese on my bagel was barely noticeable, it was like they wer spreading butter onmy bagel instead of cream cheese.  Sorry but when I order a bagel with cream cheese I expect there to be cream cheese on it. Other than that it is just your typical corporate Einsteins.
