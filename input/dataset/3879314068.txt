Last year, I was here on vacation. We had a great experience, which ultimately led us to spending a good amount of money. I got a gorgeous pendant that I love. Their salesperson told me that my pendant was made of white gold. I'm not quite sure what to believe, but I love the pendant setting and the pearl, of course. The problem is that.... when I tried to wear the pendant regularly, I found that my skin would rash wherever the pendant would be resting on. My skin only rashes with low quality metals. My skin doesn't rash with sterling silver or white gold, which this business claims to sell. I still love my pendant, but I don't know what to do now. I suppose just wear it once in a while for short periods of time... it makes me sad because I really really like the pendant. :(
