What a gem!!  I love the selection (even has takoyaki) and taste.  Also love that the combo hot dishes such as salmon teriyaki (one of my fav's) comes with red bean rice instead of just plain white rice. Really fresh fish, that even my very picky sister complimented on the freshness and loved her meal.
