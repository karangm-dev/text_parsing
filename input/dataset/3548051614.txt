The BEST FREE thing in Vegas. If you don't see the fountains when your in Vegas then you didn't go to Vegas. Love the music of Frank Sinatra and Elvis. Real Vegas style. Really who cares if they use thousands and thousands of gallons of water.Tip: Get there early to get a good seat (a standing seat)
