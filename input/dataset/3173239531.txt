I purchased an air filter for my 2016 dodge vehicle two months ago.  I was unfamiliar on how to do the replacement myself, so I waited until my next oil change so the mechanic could properly install it (because this is a new vehicle).  When I took my car in for service, I was told that I did not have the correct filter.  I returned to Autozone to exchange it for the correct one.  Unfortunately I couldn't find my receipt.  When I arrived at the store and showed them the box, I was told that they do not carry that filter.  I then told them the make and year of my vehicle so they could look it up.  They then discovered they do carry it.  Here the filter that I had was incorrectly labeled (correct part number, wrong filter). Because of this, I was told their was nothing that could be done, and the person waiting on me (which was the store manager) kept making statements insinuating that it wasn't possible that I purchased the filter there and that I must of some how placed the label on the box! Like I was trying to get a free filter!?!?! A $20 filter?!?! I have never been so insulted in my life.  I have been a loyal customer to AutoZone, but I assure you, I will NEVER shop at store 1948 again, and I will spread the word to as many people possible about this location.  The sad thing is, it was the store manager that waited on me!!! Are the managers trained in customer service etiquette?  This literally ruined my entire day.  It wasn't the fact I couldn't return it, it was the way I was treated and how it was handled.  Especially coming from a store manager.  He could have simply said, you can't return the item without a receipt, but to treat me like some kind of lying criminal, Unbelievable.
