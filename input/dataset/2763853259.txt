I received the worst customer service ever from this location today (8/19/15). First off when I pulled up to the speaker in the drive thru, I was not greeted with a hello, a thank you for choosing our company, or by a name. Instead I was greeted with, "can I help you?" I was thrown off by this but didn't think to much of it. As I'm waiting I see the customer in front of me doesn't look happy. But again I don't pay too much attention to it. I get up to the window and again was not greeted with anything but my total. I hand her my card and she hands it back without a thank you. Then she proceeds to hand me my food and coffee while she's talking to her coworker. The last thing she hands me is my coffee and then shuts the window without a thank you. I can only tolerate so much rude behavior especially if I'm a paying customer. I will not be returning to this location ever again and I recommend you do the same.
