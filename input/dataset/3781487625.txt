Oy Vey! This place will knock your socks off. Hearty Deli fare. Sandwiches to die for. Big breakfasts and a take out counter. Be prepared to wait a bit because this place is so popular, they pack 'Em in.  Great corned beef, huge omelettes. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Casual diner style seating with attentive service and knowledgeable staff. You feel like your in Bubala's kitchen.
