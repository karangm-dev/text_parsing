We came for a special birthday celebration for my family and I wasn't sure what to expect as I did look at the menu and some reviews before I arrived.  When you walk in, it is pretty, can definitely tell they re did it a little bit, added a nice bar, new furniture etc.  They even have a cute little patio in the front.  I think just the menu is not quite up my alley.  I tried a few pieces of calamari to start and they were good, not chewy, definitely fresh just the sauce they paired it with was a bit odd.  I then got a Caesar salad.  They smeared the dressing on the plate instead of pre-tossing it with the lettuce which made it hard to eat, some pieces had too much dressing and some had too little, what was very good were these fried chicken croutons.  For my meal I got the pork paprikash, the pork is very smokey, too smokey for me, but it was a huge serving of pork.  Then the spaetzle's were on the much smaller side from what I am used to so I feel like I didn't get the true feeling it was paprikash.  The creme fraiche is what makes the dish and is necessary in every bite to really round out the flavors.  I tried my mom's fried chicken and mac n cheese and really wish I would of went with that, the breading was very crispy and the mac n cheese was good from my few bites.As far as I dessert I tried a bite of the deep fried brownie, it was a bit weird because the brownie wasn't necessarily cooked on the inside and it was very runny.I am glad I tried it but I will not be back.
