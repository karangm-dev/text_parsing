I am a business owner in Glendale, and my company and I have purchased bakery items on several occasions (over 50 times). Their service is  great, and the owner Lora adds a personal touch. We have ordered several baked goods and there is a big difference between a store bought cake that was pre-processed before it was put on a shelf and a Baker Wee Cake. Several of you posted you get what you pay for, and that is true, but with a Baker Wee Cake you get more quality and taste than what you pay for. I have also purchased their muffins for meetings. Check out their chocolate muffins they are definately unique and when they're heated they melt in your mouth. I attend a lot of community meetings and when I have time I stop by Baker Wee's and purchase donuts and/or muffins. Everyone is happy. This is not a five star resoort, but it sure is a five star bakery. I encourage to give them a try.Dave Mitchell CIC, MBA, MA.HR, SPHR
