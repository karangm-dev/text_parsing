Wow is right. And Bow is apparently what you have to do to them in order to be a client. Once I recovered from the stench coming in the door to this place, I was immediately assaulted by their long list of things I MUST do. Note to management- As a prospective client, I MUST do nothing.   Leave your shelter attitude at home. Oh wait, I've actually been to many friendlier shelters. I was NOT allowed to see the potty area, I was not allowed to see the play area, and contrary to their website, my dogs MUST be thrown in with the community against my will, exposing them to god-knows-what risks from other dogs and the diseases they might carry (based on smell of the place).  So, you see the only thing I MUST do, is leave this review to warn others against ever trusted your beloved pets to this business.
