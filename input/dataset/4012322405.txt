I spent about three and a half hours reading customer reviews on a number of area AC repair services. I settled on AZ Dukes of Air because of the great reviews I read. I have to say that I am so happy that this is the company I selected. I called shortly after 7:00 am,  was given a time window of 10-12, and Robert arrived at 1035. He was done in just over an hour. He was efficient, courteous, and very much able to put things into terms that I could understand. I feel that the amount I was charged was fair for the work that he did. I will definitely call them again when I need AC service. Thank you Tonya, for getting me a same-day appointment. Thank you, Robert, for being the wonderful technician that you are!
