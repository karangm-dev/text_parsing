This is me and every one of my friends that I share with favorite brunch spot in Vegas!! Every time we're in Vegas we always come here for brunch it's absolutely the BEST and a MUST! Everything on the menu is delish- chicken and waffles, French toast, Benedict's, sliders, tuna sandwich, BLTs, calamari app, ahi poke app, basically everything on the menu! And of course unlimited mimosas are the perfect pick me up
