I was on a business trip and was staying at THE HOTEL @ Mandela Bay. I inquired about a Sushi place and was directed to RM Seafood. What a treat they had just gotten in some Big Eye Tuna and it was out of this world. My wait staff was very friendly and on top of everything. I felt like I was the only one there. You must go there if you get a chance. Brad
