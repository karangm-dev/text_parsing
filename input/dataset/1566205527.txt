Been to this buffet enough times.  Wide variety of choices, which is nice, but I got food poisoning last visit.  There is nothing else it could have been as that was the only meal for the day.  Got so violently ill I was unable to travel!Yes, great selection, but prepare yourself just in case you pick something tainted.
