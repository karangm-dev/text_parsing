Wonderful tasty late night dinner!Aside the fact that this place deserves a 5 stars for just being opened at 10:30 pm, its food is also delicious and not too expensive. We got bridge noodles and veggie, the stock was really well brewed, and not actually spicy despite the many red pepper pieces in it. We really enjoyed it.Also, they gave us a 10% discount for leaving a review, but it did not influence our rating for it.
