Springstone Montessori in the Lakes is one of my top favorite schools in Southern Nevada. The people and the environment are welcoming. There is an expectation for teacher preparation and knowledge each educator must have. As well, I immediately felt engaged and part of the community on my first visit. I look for a school that knows its mission and lives it. At Springstone, the purpose for learning is transparent. With clear glass window walls, a person can observe the care, guidance, calmness and learning. In the expansive outdoor area, there is plenty of space and activity including trikes, sand, climbing and gardening. The food preparation is made on-site with wholesome ingredients. The school provides a place for the child to develop mentally, socially, and emotionally.In early childhood development Montessori believed,"The child's conquest of independence begins with his first introduction to life.  While he is developing, he perfects himself and overcomes every obstacle that he finds in his path.  A vital force is active within him, and this guides his efforts towards their goal.  It is a force called the 'horme', by Sir Percy Nunn."  (The Absorbent Mind, Chapter 8, p. 83). I look for a place where a child is encouraged to pursue his/her interested, develop as his/her pace and be guided by loving, knowledgeable people.
