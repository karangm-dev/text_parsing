Kaibab Animal Hospital in Scottsdale is one of the best. When I needed my dogs fixed, I gave them a try. Dr. Wright and his team made it a simple process, when I came in with my two doxies in tow. The office is very clean, which made me feel good about the health of my pups. After that, Kaibab became our veterinarian of choice. Both doctors educate you about the suggested procedures beforehand - no surprises. We now take our dogs in for routine exams and the normal services that rambunctious wiener dogs need. I love that you can schedule online. I highly recommend this veterinarian for those in Scottsdale, east Phoenix and the east valley.
