THEY REDEEMED THEMSELVES IN A BIG WAYAround a month after GRJD replaced the battery in my watch, the watch conked out.  They cheerfully replaced the battery, no charge.  It could have been a bad battery or my watch is messed up.  It wouldn't surprise me if the two-year-old Casio has already outlived its usefulness.   The world revolves around a throw-away paradigm.Replacing watch batteries isn't a profit center.  Jewelers probably do it only to generate goodwill.  GRJD went out of their way to be gracious and welcoming.
