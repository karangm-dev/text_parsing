We love this place - great, knowledgeable owner and an incredible wine and saki selection. Nestled inside the 7th Street Public Market, this is a great spot to grab a bottle and stay to eat or grab six (or more) to take home for your collection. We enjoy telling Josh what we're making for dinner, what we'd like to spend on a bottle, and watching him quickly spring to action.  His suggestions haven't disappointed us yet!
