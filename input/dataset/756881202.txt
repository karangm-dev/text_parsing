I was skeptical about all these great reviews. After taking my car into the shop, I won't take my car anywhere else in the Phoenix area. Crawford's Auto repair was extremely thorough. They pinpointed a noise to three contributing factors: a rock in the tire, a roof rack bolt, and something in the sun roof. I love how detail-oriented these guys are. They gave me a list of recommended repairs. Not once, did they push ... Overall, the experience was great. I found it easy to schedule an appointment. I respected the fact that they honored their estimated time frames. I love how communicative they were. Highly recommended!
