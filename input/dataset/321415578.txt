Poor Service. I would go elsewhere for BMW service. This is not an impulse review. I waited to cool down. Save yourself a lot of time and energy. Go somewhere else!  Poor communication. The BMW recall, the reason I scheduled the appointment was needed but they didn't have the part. I was told it would take 3 weeks to get the part. If you don't have the part why schedule the service?!?!
