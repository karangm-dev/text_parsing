We brought our Boxer here. She was a rescue about 7 years old when we got her. Took her for heartworm and a full check up. Staff was very nice, explained everything they were doing. Suggested updates for vaccination and prevention. No pressure for us to get any of it done(but we did it all anyway). They handled Lola with care and we will go back this summer.
