* BEWARE * Save yourself the time, cost, tears, frustration. Do NOT trust this couple (Madison Nicole Curtis & Greenburgh Lam Yuen) with anything important to you ! You will be stolen from, lied to, blocked / ignored. I have come in contact with as many as 10 people they have scammed, and that's just from social media, Yelp, Facebook, Insta, etc. God only knows who else has been affected. We had a signed contract and paid them in full for their service for my sister's wedding back in October 2016 ! We have NO pictures of ANYTHING from my sister's reception, No recollection of her BEAUTIFUL, labor intensive decorations, cake, flowers, food, first dance or any dances at all. We had it at the Richard Nixon Library East Room which is gorgeous inside and out, but unfortunately we have nothing to look back on.We also have no video we were promised.They go months without responding to messages and questions, until they block you from contacting them at all. If you are able to get a hold of them, you're met with bizarre excuses, lies, and hostility. All I can do is apologize to my sister for this happening to her. They are still scamming people to this very day and can not keep getting away with it!  We are now taking legal action.
