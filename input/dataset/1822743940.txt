Meh, after reading the other reviews I went in here to try and get a few cushions for my travel trailer redone. I was told by a young woman they had a "sofa and a chair" waiting to be done in the work area and if I can come back in 3 weeks they might be able to get to it. No thanks.Would be one star but the woman was somewhat pleasant.
