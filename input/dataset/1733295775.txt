This is the best breakfast i had since 3 years!We enjoyed excellent customer service & very reasonable prices.More important, I ordered 3 eggs over-easy with home-made fries; let me tell you: the eggs were done the best way, just like the book says!So clean place, smiling staff, great place to come back to again and again.
