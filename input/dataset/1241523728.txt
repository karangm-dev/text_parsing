I can't believe I'm about to say this.  The Village Seafood Buffet at Rio USE to be my favorite buffet.  I'm ALL about seafood.  What better than an all-you-can-eat seafood buffet?!I came here Saturday night at around 9:30PM.  I was getting a little worried as I wanted enough time to sit and enjoy the food here.  The line wasn't as long as I expected, and it went by rather fast.  I think they may have changed how they control the lines.  When I went a year ago, we had to get a number and wait to be called before we got to stand in line.  ANYHOO, I was SO excited when we finally sat down.  I got everything from sushi to crab claws (a BUNCH of crab claws).  Boy, was I in for a total SHOCK! What happened to this place?  The sushi made me want to gag.  It wasn't cut correctly and it just didn't taste fresh.  I had to force myself to finish the sushi because I'd feel bad for wasting it.  I have NEVER had to force myself to finish sushi.  The baby lobster tails didn't taste right.  Me and my friend couldn't put our fingers on it, but we weren't sure what the heck it tasted like.  The cocktail shrimp were okay.  The quality has drastically gone down for this place.  No wonder it was so easy for us to get in!  In the end, all I could enjoy were the crab claws.My friend decided to try their gelato, and they couldn't even get that right!  Needless to say, we walked out of this place very disappointed.  Hey, at least we got front row parking at the self-parking garage (their valet had been full the last 3 times I've come here)!As sad as it is for me to write this, I don't think I'll be coming back to this buffet.
