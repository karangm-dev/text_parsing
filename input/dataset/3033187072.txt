Mantra is another fine example of Indian food in Phoenix.  Offering their take on many traditional Indian and Indo-Chinese dishes, this restaurant proves once again how lucky we are to have a large Indian population in Phoenix.       Having sampled a great deal from this menu I can say without a doubt it is the most consistent Indian food restaurant I have tried.  From the assorted breads, appetizers, and currys, I have yet to taste one item that was good if not great.  Since there is so much going on menu wise I'll stick to reviewing my go-to lately.  Bhel Puri; fried lentils, potato, peanut, onion, tomato, mint, yogurt, and tamarind served cold almost resembling a dip but eaten as is.  It's a great mixture of flavors and texture, a very refreshing start to a meal.  Next is the Chili Paneer.  It's an indo-chinese dish consisting or fried paneer cubes smothered in a chilli sauce with a vegetable fried rice.  Although not traditional Indian, it's hard to not order this as it's so delicious.  The large chunks of paneer with the sweet chilli sauce are just out of this world good and the vegetable fried rice has a perfect blend of fresh vegetables while also not being oily or greasy.  Like stated previously I have tasted a large portion of the menu and I have yet to be satisfied by the food.  In regards to the restaurant itself, it's a simple dining room with classic restaurant lighting.  The staff are friendly and more then willing to help you figure out the menu, they also are more than willing to adjust heat to taste so don't be afraid  to ask.
