It's Christmas Day and I won wife of the year because my husband and I traveled 4 hours to watch the game. We get there and every single member of the support team was wonderful. We search for our seats and no one could find them. The usher sits us and says enjoy. Seconds later this guy, Mike (a supervisor) comes up and says you can't sit here. We say no worries please help us find our seat. He says (with the shit face) this is your seat but I gave it to someone else! With a asshole straight face and tells us to move. But it was our seat! Way to go hiring manager. You hired a good one. No customer service skills whatsoever. Is this how you you treat your visitors?Mike sucks. Merry Christmas to us
