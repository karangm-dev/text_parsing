I can eat Pho everyday. That being said, I can cook Pho. While we are in Vegas, it was cold so we went to find Pho and I can't tell you how often I'm disappointed with other restaurants Pho but not here. Their Pho broth here has the least MSG taste. Let me emphasize that it's extremely rare for me to like other people Pho, so I highly recommend their Pho here. My 5 stars is purely for the food. Service and other things have room for improvement
