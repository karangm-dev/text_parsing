This is a great dealership. I had very good experience when returning from a trip to Utah, my bike broke down and was towed to this dealer ship. Major repairs were done on my bike.The staff, management, and technicians were very knowledgeable, professional and  care about customer.I highly recommend this dealership, even if you have to go out of your way.
