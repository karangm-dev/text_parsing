I don't expect the greatest service when I go to ihop, but today I had the worse service of my life. Aside from the food taking 30 minutes to come out, three of the five meals came out wrong and it took another 15 minutes to get the right order. By the time the rest of us got our food, everyone else was done eating. On top of that, our waters were empty before our food even showed up and when we tried to get the attention of another server (Kirsten). She made direct eye contact with us and walked right passed us. We finally went up to speak to a manager and his exact words were "what do you want?". All in all, worse service I have ever experienced. The manager did take off one of the meals and discounted our checks, but it didn't make up for our poor service.
