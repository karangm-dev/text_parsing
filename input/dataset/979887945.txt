The real deal!  If you like your Catholicism quiet and personal with a little organ music and perhaps some donuts after mass, then St. Mary's downtown Phoenix is the parish for you.Originally built in 1881, it is the oldest Catholic Church in Phoenix.  Staffed by the Franciscans and located in the heart of Downtown Phoenix.  The masses are traditional, thoughtful and beautiful.  The choir is phenomenal and there is an innate sense of family there-even as a guest.
