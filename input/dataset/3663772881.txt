Ate here this morning, bf and I both got bacon and egg burritos. As I am eating mine I notice an awful taste, but my bf didnt so I thought I was crazy. I ate maybe half before I wanted to gag. So my bf tried mine and noticed that awful taste too. It tasted like it was rotten, and like a dirty dish rag and vomit.  Like their fridge broke and the food rotted in there all night. Only thing different about our burritos is that I used red sauce and he used green sauce. 6 hours later, I start vomiting and have been since. This is the only thing I have eaten today.  I am not thrilled.  I am never eating here again. Lesson learned.They need to be inspected before they make others sick as well. If I could give less than 1 star,  I'd give them zero.
