The Restaurant is interesting calling itself a California Style Wine Bistro.  Our Server was excellent in attention, speed and knowledge of the food, etc.  I ordered the Fisherman's Wharf Chowder (without the bread bowl) and received a large bowl of chowder that was very filling but had too much salt flavor.  I also had the Local Corned Beef Reuben Sandwich that seemed to be made of sliced roast beef and not corned beef, far from tasty to me.  I chose French Fries over the side of fresh fruit, which was a mistake.  They were seasoned but tasted like Salty fries only.  Another diner had the French Onion Soup which was reported as very good.An interesting fact is that the restaurant does not have salt and pepper shakers on the tables.  Based on the taste of the food I had I'd say the chef does diners a great favor, since so many people add salt before tasting their dish.  The chef does not spare salt from what I could tell.There were 20 of us dining here for lunch and most reported dissatisfaction with the food.  A typical comment was "I've had better..."
