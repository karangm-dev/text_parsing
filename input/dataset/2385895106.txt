On a Tuesday night at 6 PM, we ordered a pepperoni pizza and combo (zucchini, moz and shrimp)  app. We were told 1-1.5 hours and it arrived right before 2 hours. No one called our phone number to mention they were running late and when it finally did arrive to our complex, they had our front office call us instead of doing it themselves. Everything was cold and there was no cocktail sauce for the shrimp (which are fried, not cocktail shrimp, btw). After we reheated everything, tasted awesome. Fresh, yummy cheese and great breading on the apps. The zucchini are coins, not strips (yay!). Disappointed with timing and coldness due to the high reviews. Maybe we caught them on an off day.
