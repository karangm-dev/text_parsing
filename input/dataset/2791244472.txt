When drive here,  you will feel as if you were transformed and not in Toronto anymore.  Yes, the area is dodgy.  The area feels third world.  The parking area is dirty and it feels poor.I heard about Aunt Elsie on the CBC and decided to try it out.   As you walk inside, it is a small grocery store that sells a bunch of Caribbean goods.  You would never know that they sell one of the best jerk chicken in Toronto.The owners seem to be chinese.  They probably lived in Jamaica since I heard the chinese population is pretty big in Jamaica.I ordered the jerk chicken to go.   It took about 5 minutes for my order to be fulfilled.   Total was about $10.   When I opened up the takeout container, I smelled the amazing smell coming at me.  The jerk chicken was tender and the rice that came with it was really good too.   medium spicy and very moist.  Amazing deal!   Too bad that it's kind of far away from me but I'd definitely come here again.
