Stellar Asian food! I've eaten Asian at the Bellagio, Caesar's and Venetian and this place in the Hard Rock is by far the best. Unpretentious prices, attentive and friendly staff, a great menu selection and tasty food bursting with savory umami. They had a cute dim sum platter that had one piece of every type of dim sum you could want. How easy is that?
