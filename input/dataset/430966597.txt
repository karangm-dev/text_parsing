Gone here couple times before and always like their garden eggs benedict. But this time I decided to change it up a bit and order their chorizo eggs benedict. It wasnt what I expected. Burnt, no pinto de gallo, pototoes was cold. Wasn't happy. My fiance got the corn beef hash, thumbs down. had to ask them to remake it. it was burnt yet soggy in the inside. overall not happy. used to be good. idk what happened. the cook probably had a rough morning. lol
