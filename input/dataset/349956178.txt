The worst place we ate at during our stay in Montr√©al for the JazzFest 2 weeks ago. The food was mediocre, basically on the same level as TGIFridays.  Actually TGIFridays may be 1 1/2 stars better. The ambiance is very romantic and that's the only reason for the 2 stars.  The service was the absolute worse.  The waiter had no customer service skills. The steak was okay, the appetizer was ok, but the ribs were disgusting. I would not recommend or go there again This place is not worth the price. Save your money and appetite and go somewhere else.
