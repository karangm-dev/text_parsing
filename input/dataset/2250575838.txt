Food sucks. Ordered the beef brisket with ricotta and steak frites. The steak tasted really bland and the beef brisket did not taste very good really heavy on the cheese and a very strong mushroom taste. It didn't go well with cheese. Got fries and the bread as well. Fries are soggy and the bread was stone cold. I assumed that they serve cold bread with butter. The service wasn't good either. We asked if they serve beer the server drop the menu to us and left without asking if we wanted any drinks. Waited quite a long time to order a drink  and our food. She didn't check if we were ok with the food or drink. Very disappointed with  this restaurant. I don't suggest anyone to go  there.
