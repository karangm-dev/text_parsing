Can I give more than 5 stars??  I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Stickland and the staff at Animal Medical Center of Chandler!   I have two rescued mastiffs and both love her!  One of my dogs is a mess and when I adopted him he needed surgeries to be neutered, have teeth removed and have a leg amputated.  He hadn't had much medical care and Dr. Stickland made sure he was doing well.  She also took the time to work with me on scheduling his surgeries and referring me to someone for his leg.  She performed major dental surgery on my guy and thankfully he has enough teeth left in the back to eat normally.  Dr. Stickland has been wonderful to work with and has helped me to get this boy back in good shape.  All the techs are wonderful and friendly and their love for animals is obvious!!  Thanks for taking such great care of my Henry.
