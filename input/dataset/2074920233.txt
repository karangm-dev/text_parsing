Saigon Kitchen is not representative of Vietnamese food. I have tried it three times and have yet to have any dish that is authentic Vietnamese. For Vietnamese food, I'll stick with Pho Viet Nam or Saigon Pho in Chandler --- where more realistic Vietnamese food can be found. Anyone who calls this great Vietnamese food simply has never tasted real Vietnamese food. And any vet who says this is just like the food in Nam was, I can assure you, either high or eating at the base. Calling Saigon Kitchen Vietnamese food is as bad as those that call Olive Garden Italian food or Red Lobster seafood.
