Michael let's me host my monthly documentary event here called PopDocs in a private room. Like PopDocs on Facebook! The event is open to the public and Lucky Foo's is accommodating. We always order food during the documentary and grub away. I need to come here to check out their brunch too. If you dot live in Henderson, this place is still worth the drive to check out.
