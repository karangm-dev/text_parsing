Destination amazing. Our server Kelley made our whole dining experience extremely grand. He explained the lunch menu thoroughly. Not sure why- the food is grand but the menu is vague. The Red Sangria and Mojito are positively refreshing. Lasagna bolognese contains fresh made noodles. I watched the chef roll those delightful starchy chains right out of the machine. We are thrilled to have ended our Labor Day at this location. Without question we will be back and we will bring our friends. Nice break from the ordinary dining experience.  Atmosphere is beautiful and unique. Peanut butter mouse-fascinating-hard chocolate, light mouse and an airy powder.
