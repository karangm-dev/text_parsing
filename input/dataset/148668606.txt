I love this shoe store... the staff is friendly and knowledgeable about their products. Today, my mother and I went in for their Mother's Day sandal sale. The shoes might not look the most fashionable in the world, but if you need comfortable shoes that still look nice and you can wear all day, this is the shoe store! I have a pair I wore from morning to night.  Their shoes come in a variety of wide sizes, so there's sure to be something to fit, and everything from sneakers to dress shoes. Otherwides Shoes  is definitely a place to get long-lasting, great comfortable shoes.
