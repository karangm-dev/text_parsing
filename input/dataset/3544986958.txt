I called in a water leak which was coming out of the water meter box, clear full of water, and they said it would take 2 weeks to come out.   After two weeks with no calls and still a water leak I called them and they said they fixed 4 days ago.   I told them that water was still coming out of the top of the water box and they said "well, we will schedule it again but can't do anything today.   So who knows.  I feel bad for their customer reps because they must just get beat every day.   They charge you $400 a month for water and have crap service, and bitch they need another 35% increase to survive!
