Fern is our favorite brunch spot!  Nice ambiance both inside and on the patio out front.  We have tried the muffins (flavors rotate) to start and enjoy the apple butter that comes with them.  There are a few staples on the brunch menu but I like that many items change week to week.  One of my favorite entrees is the grits that are often topped with some assorted veggies, vegan hollandaise sauce, and a vegan protein like tofu or tempeh.  My husband loves the brunch nachos, the chimichanga (from the lunch menu), or the tofu scramble. We have been here 6 or 7 times now and have not been disappointed!
