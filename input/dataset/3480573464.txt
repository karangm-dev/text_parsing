Just an average dog, but costs way too much.We ordered a plain dog and a corn dog, just the 2 hot dogs were nearly $12.00No sides, no drinks, nothing in addition.We had planned to order donuts on the side, but the machine was broken.The hot dogs were ok, but it's cheaper to buy a corn dog at the CNE.The place looks just like Poutini's inside. Fine if you are drunk, but the food is cheaper and better elsewhere.
