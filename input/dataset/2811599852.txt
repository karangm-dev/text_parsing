So this is more of a public service-type announcement. I just want to make sure everyone is aware of the situation that happened a few weeks ago at this Petsmart location....A newfoundland was brought in for grooming, in good health...and when the owner returned to pick her up she was incoherent and her temperature was 109 degrees. The dog did not make it, her organs were fried. It's clear the dog was kept in a very hot facility for too long. There is no other way a dog's temp can get this high. Please look up this story before you consider bringing your dog here for grooming!
