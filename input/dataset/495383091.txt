Ramen Hashi was recommended to us and we are so happy we listened! It was so easy to pick what we wanted. Their menu was small, but so very delicious! If you love ramen, Ramen Hashi will be your new favorite spot. Tori Paitan Ramen is their must have if you're into creamy broths. Love, love, love this place.
