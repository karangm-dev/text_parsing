They have had my phone for over a month now.  I have asked several times for an update on the status.  I have only received one response.  The loaner phone that I paid to borrow is defective and will not stay in service.  I have messaged several times about this and called as well.  I have heard nothing on this.  Locally they can replace an Iphone screen the same day, but at Esurranty it apparently takes a lifetime.On a side note they are very quick to take your money.  I would stay away from this company.  I am not convinced that it is all not a scam.Update:  I got several emails shortly after posting this.  We will see how the phone is when I get it back.
