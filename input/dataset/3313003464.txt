I ordered an arrangement for my mother for Mother's Day with next day delivery. Prices were very fair and the flowers looked better than expected! I requested a note to go along with the delivery, usually the notes are just printed out from a computer, but this store took the time to HAND WRITE my note. The really made the entire experience much more meaningful and personal for my mother. The reviews here do not justify the level of service I experienced. I will go out of my way to order through this florist again.
