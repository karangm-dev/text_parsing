I've been here twice and have been pierced by Six (the owner) and Jessie. Both are incredibly lovely and take the time to make sure you're happy with placement, etc before they do anything. They're on the pricier side, but honestly you get what you pay for, and for piercings I'd rather be safe than sorry! Their jewellery selection is also great, but I've opted for basic titanium studs and rings only so far. I'll definitely be back!
