Very disappointing. Early reviews were solid but I see why many have left poor reviews as of late. Atmosphere is nice and a great location downtown. In spite of this, management is doing a bad job at running the restaurant. They were out of half their tap beers as well as many of their bottled beers.  How does that happen?  I think alcohol and beer vendors deliver daily. I don't think I've ever seen that before other than maybe a backyard party at my buddy's. Service was extremely lackluster. Servers and food runners basically were doing us a favor by doing their job. Don't ask for a serving spoon to share a salad because if you do, they will give you stink eye, a deep sigh, and if you're lucky, give you a teaspoon.  The fish and chips were one level above Long John Silver. Actually LJS is better and their charcuterie is average at best with horrible presentation and delivery. The only reason this place gets 2 stars instead of 1 is that the beet salad was terrific!  Other than that I would avoid this place at all costs. Not worth the money and definitely not worth the aggravation of dealing with staff that have no interest in making the customer experience enjoyable.  Go to Hannys down the street instead. Same type of eclectic menu with solid service and actually a fully stocked bar!
