My first time here, arrived at 10:15, ordered around 12:30, totally worth the wait.  The brisket is probably the best thing I have ever put in my mouth.  It literally melts in your mouth and had a beautiful smoke ring.  I've been to Memphis, Dallas, and Kansas City and never had BBQ this good.  No sauce needed!
