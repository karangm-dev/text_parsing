I love this place. They have the best steaks in town. They serve 22-24 oz. rib eyes and porterhouse steaks that just makes you want to visit this place whenever you are in town. The  sides they serve are just as fantastic. Their mac and cheese along with their cream spinach will guarantee your return. This place is a must stop if you are visiting the the M resort and casino.
