This company took over management of our condo complex November 1, 2014. We only got the notice letter today also DEMANDING payment for November's condo fees. I'm sure they could have sent out the notice letter before hand to ensure that pre auth payments were completed in time for November 1st. Also our building is located in AIRDRIE and they sent us contact info for emergency and non emergency services for CALGARY. What a lack of attention to detail.
