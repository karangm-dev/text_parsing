RIP OFF ALERT!!I took my car here for an inspection and they said that it would cost $692 for exhaust and $250 for brakes to get my car to pass.  I decided to have the brakes done at another place and come back to get the exhaust work (after taxes). When I went back they didn't even have a record that I made the appointment but said they would "squeeze me in" and that they needed to reinspect it.  After the "re-inspection" they said it would be $1000 + for just the exhaust!!! They said I must have done some damage in the 2 months since (???).  I researched Angie's list and took the car to a place that was highly recommended.  The car is inspected with exhaust all for $750! Check Angie's list it will save you hundreds!
