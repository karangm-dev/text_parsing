I went for three months and had good results at first but then my body got used to the appetite suppressants. I paid for the full program for the entire time I was there and I only saw a doctor the very first visit. They never had me see the doctor or suggest anything different when I started gaining weight back slowly. I just can't spend that kind of money on something that they weren't willing to help me with. Also I always went Tuesday or Wednesday which they claimed to be less busy and I always had to wait at least 30 min to an hour.
