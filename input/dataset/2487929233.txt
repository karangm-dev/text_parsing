Went to the restaurant on Saturday at 8:00 PM to try this new place.  The hostess was not that friendly when we walked in and seemed busy with something she was doing.  There were plenty of open tables in the restaurant but the hostess after looking at the sign in sheet said they were full and it would be a wait.  The hostess said we could sit in the bar and she would get us when a table opened up.  I still saw numerous open tables in the restaurant so I declined and said we would be leaving.  She then replied it would only be maybe 15 minutes for a table.  No thanks, I have received better receptions at other places which will be my first choice in the future.
