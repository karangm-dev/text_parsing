I started treatment in November 2014 for laser hair removal on two areas.  I was super excited to finally have, if not a hair free life at least a much less hair life!  I was informed that I would "maybe" need a touch-up here and there but that it would be very minimal, if at all.  The staff was always very nice when I would come in and they did confirm appointments regularly.  But... every appointment I had with them they were always running behind by a good 15 -30 minutes!  Other than that I was satisfied with the personal at this location.Now for the hair removal.  It didn't work - AT ALL!!!  It looked great and appeared that we were making progress for the first 5-6 sessions.  Then during the final sessions, my hair was returning sooner and in greater quantity.  I expressed my concerns and they never really said anything other than that I still have a few sessions left, that they would increase the strength of the laser and to give it time.  I am 4 months out from my final appointment and it looks as if I never went in for hair removal treatment.  All of my hair is back, with a vengeance! Unfortunately, this was a complete waste of time, pain and money for me.  I was told I was the perfect candidate for my skin tone and hair color.  If that's the case, then why didn't it work.  I would not recommend receiving this treatment as it is very pricey and does not deliver the results stated.  Even the very minimal touch-ups is an understatement in my case.  Very dissatisfied with the results.
