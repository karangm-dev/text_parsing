They are really, really great about helping students get what they need. Supplies, storage, anything! If you need help with making payments, they will understand. They have really, really amazing customer service. I have been going there for three years now and they are great. There was a problem with my account for overcharges for no reason and they waived it all and adjusted it back to where it was supposed to be. They didn't complain or give you any problems with it. They just apologize and fix it for you. I highly, highly recommend this location.
