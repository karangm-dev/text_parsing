I had one of my worst dining experiences here ever. I ordered Basil Chicken with no bell peppers.When it came, it was loaded with the slimy green peppers. I informed the waitress of the mistake and she called me a "liar". Well I was speechless. I can't believe a complete stranger is calling me a liar. I informed her that I could not eat this chicken and that I would like it as I ordered it. With even my friends backing up the fact that i ordered no green peppers, she started screaming at me and calling me a liar again. She said she would make another one, but that I will be charged for both. I refused, on principal, but also what nasty things would this irate server do to my food if a new order was remade. I refused to eat while my companion's ate. Everybody in the restaurant stared at me as tho I had just murdered somebody. It was surreal. At check out, I asked to speak to the owner to see if he would kindly remove my charge. He said he would call the police if I didn't pay for my meal. I was nice and courteous the whole time.  I submitted to his threats and paid for the meal I didn't order and didn't eat. I later called my credit card company and they reversed the charge. This is the WORST restaurant I have ever NOT eaten at in Charlotte!My advice is DON'T GO!
