How is it still too much to ask for a speaker at a drive through this busy? This evening I waited in line for 20 minutes trapped behind four cars, all of which were ordering and shooting the breeze at the window. I thought I'd get a quick tea and went from early enough to grab a drink to LA traffic claustrophobic and regrettably late for my plans. Make sure you have a half hour to spare before you enter a line. I personally waited forever and had to drive straight through without ordering a drink. This is not was a drive thru is for. I don't like to write bad reviews, but unless this ever improves or becomes more consistent, then thank goodness for multiple Starbucks locations nearby. People who work there are super nice but there's much more to customer experience than that.
