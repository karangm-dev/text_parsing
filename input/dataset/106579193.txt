If there is ever a time to cry because breakfast is so darn good, this place will have you bawling your eyes out! The food was perfectly prepared, beautifully plated and most importantly, AMAZING!!! The restaurant was a hip little place with enough color to wake up the eyes but the smells of the restaurant is what wakes up the rest! I had the gypsy steak skillet with a side of lemon blueberry frenchtoast. My girlfriend had the toasted coconut mango crepe. Both plates made the table fall silent since all we wanted was just to keep eating! SO GOOD! Definitely my new favorite place for breakfast!
