Service is bad. Sat for 10 minutes . When a wait staff came close , she informed me another server would be over. Yes he did to the table next to me who just sat down. I know the airport is busy. But common on. They know you are on a tight time frame. I had 1 1/2 hours between flights. Now less than an hour.  I got up and sat at bar. At least service was better. Cosmo ok. Should have stuck with a beer. Still no food. May have to get it to go.
