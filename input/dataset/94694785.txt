Pixy Cakes made the wedding cake for our wedding at  Secret Garden. They helped us make the decisions on the design when we weren't sure what to go with and they were flexible when we wanted to make changes. The wedding cake looked absolutely stunning at the reception. We couldn't ask for a more beautiful cake. The cake also tasted great too!
