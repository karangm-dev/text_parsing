i agree with many of the reviewers here i am VERY DISAPPOINTED in the procedure i had almost a year ago. the "quicklift" was neither quick or a lift. i look exactly the same and maybe even worse. im thin so i had some skin around my neck and lower face/mouth i wanted tightened but none of that happened. all i have to show for it are scars and chronic ear and neck pain. definitely not worth the $7k and month long post op agony, which is extra upsetting since i was a repeat client and was happy with my rhinoplasty from 7 yrs ago. gave 2 stars for that, would give zero stars for the office staff many of them have bad attitudes and apparently don't realize that cosmetic surg is primarily elective and private pay. have had no contact from office to follow up, other than the initial post op appts. i live out of state now so cannot go there in person to see if there is any way to fix it or address the ear pain/excessive scar tissue behind my right ear. very disappointing :(
