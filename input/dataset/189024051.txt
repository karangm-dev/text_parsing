I have been going to Max Automotive for awhile now, and cannot express enough how very happy I am with their work!!  It is a family owned business, and have very honest mechanics!  Kathy at the front desk is such a sweetie pie, both on the phone and in person! Terry has always been honest and fair when it comes to repairs and pricing!! Jenny is my "chauffeur" to and from home if I need to leave my car at the shop, and she has an amazing personality!!Of course, I cannot forget to mention Max and Sophie!! You will find these precious fur babies at the front door, waiting to greet you! I HIGHLY recommend Max Automotive to anyone who needs a mechanic!!
