Nothing fancy here. They seem to carry the bare minimum of everything; guns, accessories, cleaning supplies and ammo. I am sure if you ask, they could special order whatever you were in the market for. Prices were a little on the high side I felt. The staff is knowledgeable, but not very friendly. I have been there several times and have yet to see any of the guys smile. The range is decent. I sense this is what keeps the place in business. 8 stalls. Fairly clean. You are expected to sweep up your own casings. There are shot up cardboard targets available for free for you to attach your own paper targets to. Cost, including tax, was $16.01.
