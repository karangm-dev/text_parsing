Mama Mia! I am in love with this place already. Went yesterday with my fiancée and 1 year old son for the first time after hearing rave reviews for awhile now. Needless to say, I am super impressed. Atmosphere is a little informal but you are eating at a grocery store! I am obsessed with all the authentic Italian ingredients for sale throughout the store, but the food was the star for sure. I got a full chicken parmigiana sandwich on focaccia bread, fiancée got turkey breast and provolone on wheat. Total for lunch was only 15 dollars which is amazing to me, and the quality of the food can be compared to real, homemade Italian cooking by someone's real, homemade Italian grandmother. I can't wait to go back and try everything else!
