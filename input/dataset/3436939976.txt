How can you not love Trader Joe's? Everyone is eager to help and answer any questions that you may have. The prices on their produce is great. My family and I truly believe that their fried mozzarella sticks are some of the best around. I know that parking is always hit or miss, but that doesn't keep me from shopping there weekly. Their prices are pretty hard to beat!
