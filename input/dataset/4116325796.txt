Pork Belly: Best ever. Can be ordered as a small plate.Yamoto Roll: Foie gras and osetra----unbelievable!Peruvian corn: You've never had it like this. Comes with many of the small plates.Shiso ice cream: It works!Grilled beef: Perfect char on the outside, juicy and rare on inside.Grilled vegetables: healthy option, not spectacular.All that plus a cocktail= $108, great value for the quality.Service was excellent.Can't wait to go back and try the seafood curry and the wagyu beef gyoza.
