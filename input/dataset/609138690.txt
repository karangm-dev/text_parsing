I just moved from New York to Charlotte and was having a hard time finding a threading salon, decide to give this place a shot and I am very happy with the results! Customer service was spectacular, reasonably priced, and very satisfied with how my eyebrows look. Will definitely be coming back and recommend for anyone! Once you thread your eyebrows you will never want to wax them ever again.
