I wanted to like this place after reading reviews but I was severely let down. It took almost ten minutes to be greeted by our waiter, who did not come over until I had to wave him down. Chips and cheese came and the cheese was thin and cold. Enchiladas came cold and without the steak as advertised. Had to wave for the waiter again to bring the steak which came cold to no surprise. A gray piece of shoe leather in which I wish didn't come at all. Never again. Worst experience at a restaurant in years.
