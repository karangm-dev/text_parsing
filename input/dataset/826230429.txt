I have been here way too many times, and we are over it.  I will say prices are good on both food and drinks, but you get what you pay for.  On two occasions we had large parties (15+) who all are and drank a lot, and we had horrible service.  They acted like w were a bother, when actually we probably spent close to $800 that night in total.  Very disappointing.  We will not be back.
