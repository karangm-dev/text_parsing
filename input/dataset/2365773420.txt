I have been in Vegas for 10 years, moving from IL where they have killer beef sandwiches. This restaurant was AMAZING!! Everything about it was great. The people were so nice to us. The menu was jammed packed with items that sounded so good it took me forever to decide on something. I haven't been so happy about a dinner in a long time. I HAD to yelp about it. I will be telling everyone to come here and try the beef sandwich. Delizioso!!! Cannot wait to go back and try the pizza!!
