Came here because Pica Pica was closed and we didn't really have a plan b. Other reviews are not kidding about slow service. There were only a couple of other tables occupied, but only one server who took her sweet time with everything. Lemonade came after the pho and spring roll app, even though everything was ordered at the same time? And tasted like Country Time powder mix. Maybe that's why it's apportez votre vin? Pho was okay but had too much cinnamon in it (?) and was pre-flavored (did not come with the customary basil leaves, sprouts, fish sauce, and lime to make it to your taste). Disappointing to say the least. Next time I want pho in Montreal, I'll go back to Pho Bac 97. Or anywhere else.
