I had been looking for a new car primarily to use for commuting. I currently drive a full size SUV and gas adds up. My truck is paid off so we weren't in a hurry to purchase. My husband and I went to at least 5 different dealerships in the valley, from Toyota to Hyundai, to ford and Mazda. We finally decided to stop by Volkswagen, nothing really there that "caught my eye" per say, but we we willing to give it a chance. Peter Vallejo welcomed us and immediately we knew we were comfortable with him. Peter knew the cars inside and out!!! Very professional, no sales pitches, just simply doing his job, taking a step back and letting us drive an ask questions. We didn't buy on that day, we did some more research and decided to go back to see him this time to purchase. The entire staff treated us with great curtesy and respect, we were never pressured to buy. This is a great company and a great vehicle. We ended up buying a Passat! Volkswagen is a top quality vehicle. No comparison. We are glad Peter was our salesman. Highly recommend him!!! :)
