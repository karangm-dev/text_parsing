This place gets 2 stars because the food wasn't as bad as the service and to me that's pretty important to an overall good experience. Ordered two types of pizza, came in a timely fashion and everything was going great until I found some type of plastic half way through the meal....big disappointment. I should have gotten up and left but the waitress was nice and said they would come the whole meal and get me a new pizza. After waiting for the new pizza, already losing my appetite, I ate a slice and got the rest to go.  Before the check arrives the manager come to our table (I thought just to apologize about the food) and says he's sorry but the waitress miss spoke and only that pizza was getting comped. Talk about failed opportunity to fix a fault. Big slap in the face. It would take a bit to get me to want to return.
