Heaven.I don't always like to go to the most expensive place in town but when I do go to pricey places, I want to know my dollars are worth it. If this restaurant is where vegetables and animals come to die, they die happy.  It's food heaven.I'm not a huge meat fan.  I really enjoyed the sides.   Duck fat confit fingerling potatoes.  Jalape√±o creamed corn.  Baby beets, and broccolini.   The waiter was delightful and suggested a very delicious wine.   I also had the half roasted cicken.  When I took my first bite my mouth watered so much, my friends saw me drooling.  This place is nuts during most of the year but if you g of the day after stampede it is dead as a door nail.
