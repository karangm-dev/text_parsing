Not a big fan, granted their huge inventory is nice to see, but the prices are so grossly inflated I refuse to go back.  Milk Depot three blocks away is a better choice, and much more reasonable on prices!  Don't ever ever get one of their $7.99 sub sandwiches, you'll just be pissed!  They use the cheapest thin sliced fake crap, chicken and beef that you get like three packs for $1 at the grocery store, and then pass off cheap fake American cheese as chedder!  The sandwich and potato salad they give you might cost them 75 cents to make, and they $7.99 for a horrible sandwich....Can you say excessive markup!  They also charge $50 for a handle of Tito's Vodka.  Again just insane markup!  They survive off of the Indians, go figure!  I really dislike this place!
