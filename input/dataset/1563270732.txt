Not very good. The customer service was ok but the pizza was burnt. The table to my left me got their pizzas with an apology for how long it took - the table to my right got their pizza with an apology for how burnt it was-"would you like to munch on this until your other pizza come?" And mine was totally burnt but I was so fed up I just left. And it wasn't cut properly!! Lame Won't be back
