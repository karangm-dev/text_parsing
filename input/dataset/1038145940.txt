Yeaaa this place used to be 5 stars. We went tonight a Saturday night normally you would wait ATLEAST an hour, I guess were not the only ones disappointed now. Sat down right away, you pay $10 for bread now, you pay $5 for a salad when you order a pasta dish, and portions are super small unless you got the special baked spaghetti. Spaghetti must have been on sale that week. The pizza crust is amazing the sauce has NO flavor at all cheese is fresh. We used to come a lot....that will sadly be our last time. We will drive to De Falcos!
