"Keys to Wonderful" is a complete empty statement. Your brochure lacks COMPLETE transparency and there are hidden fees in everything you do. The woman on the phone could care less about customer service - she blatantly said, "THIS SERVICE ISN'T FOR EVERYONE". REALLY WOW. Do not give them your credit card as you will not be notified of these fees until you log in and go thru the statement yourself.
