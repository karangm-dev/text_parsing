Loved the food, but not the prices. Oh well! I don't remember names of the sandwiches, but we tried two different kinds and I loved them. One had turkey and cranberry sauce (they ran out of stuffing) but I didn't care! The other one had a kick to it. Peppers, chipotle sauce and roast beef. YUMMY! We were staying right down the street and I found this place on yelp and I'm glad we did. :-)
