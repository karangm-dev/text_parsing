When I returned my car. I did the unthinkable! ! I left my wallet in the car and didn't discover it until I was on the tram to the airport.  Thankfully I was able to call them from my google search.  The man who checked the car in found it and held it for me until I got back. Such honesty is rare these days and certainly much appreciated! I highly recommend this outstanding rental company from Manny at the counter to the guys checking in the cars. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
