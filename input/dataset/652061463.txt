I found about this restaurant from the internet a couple of days ago and decided to give it a shot for all the reviews were good. Not so surprisingly, all my family found the dishes we ordered very tasty and well served. The staff met our needs and were kind. We especially liked the oxtail noodle soup and would love to go again!
