This is my go-to breakfast spot!  We've never had to wait for a table, which is definitely nice when you're looking for your first meal of the day.  The menu is large and includes both breakfast and lunch items.  I love that if you order water or iced tea, they bring a pitcher to your table.  The service has always been friendly and despite how large of a restaurant it is, we have never had to wait a long time for our food to come out.
