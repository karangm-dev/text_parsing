Dope spot. Super clean and I love the decor here. Taste has really bold flavors. We ordered the jelly fish, pan fried noodles, xiao long bao and szechuan chicken with jalape√±o. No complaints, the portion was really nice and service was on point. I can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu. My new go to restaurant for some kick ass Chinese food. Highly recommend!!!
