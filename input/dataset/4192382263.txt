Excellent Job.  Bravo AGAIN Discount Tire!  Kyle is a star, friendly, patient and competent. I am very detail oriented and although I too can be patient, I want my stuff done perfect. I bring my cars in spotless, wheels shiny and clean (even the back side of the rims) and I expect a job well done with no mistakes and no nicks and DISCOUNT TIRE always delivers. I have purchased tires and or wheels for more than 25 of my vehicles over the last 20 years exclusively from Discount Tire who are truly my favorite US company under the "best customer service" category.
