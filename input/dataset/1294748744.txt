I've been going to my dentist for about 5 years. The scheduling was not too flexible so I decided to try something new that a friend had suggested. I was nervous as I had already developed a trusting relationship with my previous dentist. I have never been so satisfied. My cleaning was perfect and gentle. Dr. Constantinou did an exceptional job on my crown, which was on my front tooth! I would show anyone my before and after photos. I'm so satisfied and I can't stop smiling. Awesome staff, can't wait to come back.
