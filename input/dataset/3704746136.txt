This was our 5th consecutive year at Grandview and our experience there has become worse in the last two years. The quality of clientele at the resort is on the decline and at this rate, the place will feel more like public housing than a resort. Extremely noisy guests, inoperable elevators, unheated pools and filthy poolside toilets were just the beginning. Security never addressed our raucous neighbors who forced us and our seven year-old to move to a different room at 1:00 AM. The AC did not work in the new room but maintenance person Milton responded promptly to temporarily fixed it until morning. The next day, maintenance was at our door first thing to fix the problem. Although this was the only positive interaction we had with staff, it is not enough to bring us back for a 6th visit.
