My husband and I are frequent customers of the Chandler location steakhouse.  Normally we have always been satisfied with service and meal.  We usually spend 180.00 - 200.00....  Last week we ordered the King Crab Legs and was terribly disappointed.  The quality was much like what you would get at a casino buffet if not less.   When I complained to, I presumed the Manager, she kindly brought an additional half order to our table and they looked identical to my original order.  It's as though they scraped the bottom of the pot for these sad little legs.  The presentation was horrible.   My husbands rib eye for the first time was not cooked properly and the quality of the beef had so much gristle and way too much marbling there was little left that was palatable.  What's up here!!   We may have to drive into Phoenix or Scottsdale for a quality steak.  Too bad.
