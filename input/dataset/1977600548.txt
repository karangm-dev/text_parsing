This place is fun, I mean it a pinball arcade, but, read the reviews; every bad one involves how the employee (Tim) treats kids.  My wife and I brought our six month old and being a baby, she got fussy in her stroller.  We pulled her out and took turns holding her.  She got heavy and I set her on the glass.  Tim yelled at us to get her off the glass.  Okay, that's fair, totally my fault.  A bit later I'm holding our daughter by resting her on top of my head (with both hands around her waist), and he comes up and says that he's had problems with us before with the glass, and ifI'm going to be irresponsible and kill my kid (by resting her on my head) he was going to say something about it.  Okay man, duly noted. We left after that.
