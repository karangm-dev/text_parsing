Not happy that I cannot speak with anyone when I call. They do not call back promptly to setup appointments and follow ups. Been trying to get in all week for a med check. Offices can be hard to find and I have never spoken with someone in reception when I've called. We called 3 times yesterday and once today and still haven't been called back.
