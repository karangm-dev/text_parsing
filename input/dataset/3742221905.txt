I've lost my patience with this location. While my experiences at the drive through have not been terrible, don't even consider dining in. One of our first experiences dining in was at least 10-15 min wait for 2 combo meals, which were wrung up wrong when taking the order to begin with. Dining room was empty as well, as it usually is. Starting to see why...2nd time in, only 1 person in front of us. Pretty empty dining room but a few people came in just after us. We placed our order promptly (2 combo meals). Around 10 min later 2-3 orders placed AFTER we placed ours are delivered to their tables. Finally we see our tray behind the counter, where it just sits there for another 5 min. When I went up 15 min after placing our order, it appeared that our order was in full, just sitting on the tray. No one made any attempt to fix it, and even the manager asked what it was waiting on. the order clearly looked like it was all there - just sitting behind the counter and no timeframe to be delivered to a table, or simply handed to us. I asked for a refund and went to Wendy's instead. Do yourself a favor and go around the corner to the Wendy's as well (right onto Warner and will be on your left). You'll be in and out in the same amount of time it will take simply waiting for your Carl's order.
