Absolutely HORRIBLE service.  Deliveries do not arrive as scheduled.  Calls to the company are a waste of time.  I sent an email and got an automated response that said "customer service will contact you within 24 hrs". That was a week ago; no call.  I did complain to Amazon. I would suggest that all of you do the same.
