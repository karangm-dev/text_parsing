In a word: "Bland". Everything about this place is one step below average. The service; impersonal. The food; somewhat tasteless. The atmosphere; certainly not Japanese! In fact...everything is Chinese; employees, music and lack of customer service attitude (shares parking lot with the Bank of China office building, so go figure). But then again, what do you expect from an all you can eat place - something I didn't know until it was too late to run. Also, doesn't take AMEX.
