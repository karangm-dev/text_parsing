Excuses upon excuses. We made a reservation for a car a couple days in advance but when we checked the price the morning of it happened to be cheaper. So we rebooked and canceled our previous reservation. Mind you the change was only done maybe an hour before we had originally scheduled to pick up the car. When we got there they said they didnt have a car for us, get this "because we just made the reservation so they didnt have enough time to get a car there". Its 8am so my original thought was what did you do with the car from our original reservation we made days before? When they saw the change in reservation (same name, same type of car, only thing changed was the price) they brought the car back...to where?? Uh, that made no sense!Anyways, after waiting almost 40 minutes (BC it was getting washed according to the clerk) we couldn't wait anymore so they offered us a SUV. Which we didnt want but we had to leave. Why 2 stars because she was pleasant and did apologize but I didnt really appreciate the excuses and/or her making us feel like we were that dumb to beleive them. Nonetheless...another car rental disappointment.
