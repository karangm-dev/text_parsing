As part of a bridal party at Wedgewood I would NEVER have my own ceremony here! From the start of wedding day till the end it was a horrible experience. We were always being rushed by our coordinator whenever she was around but most of the time we couldn't even find her when we wanted to. We were running around like chickens with our heads cut off because we didn't know where to be or what to do when because she was no where to be found. The decorations were lacking cheap and minimal. We brought a ton of our decorations which helped but don't rely on them. This was a horrible wedding for our bride who was miserable and cried multiple times throughout the night. Beware do not get married here! Worst wedding I've ever been in and I've been in 7!
