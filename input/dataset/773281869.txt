Just moved into the neighborhood and had a hankerin' for some pizza. I ordered takeout; a large Neapolitan pie 30 minutes before closing. I arrived early and was pleasantly greeted. The gal shook my hand, welcomed me to the neighborhood and offered a free dessert as a first time customer. The pizza was hot, tasty and hit the spot! They have a loyal customer. I'm looking forward to trying other menu items.
