I recently went to this place for cleaning my car, after one of my Uber passengers throw up on the back seat. Since Uber was not kind enough to cover the fees entirely, I asked Evan if we can clean the car with the amount that Uber will cover, and he was really generous to accept, giving a signification discount to me so I can clean my car with the amount Uber provided. The service was great. They cleaned the whole interior and treated the cabin with ozone, so the smell completely disappeared (note that vomit has a terrible odour!). I never saw my car so clean, since I bought it used, and even the time I purchased the car from the dealership, it wasn't as clean as I got the car from this shop. About what they did, they washed the seats with shampoo and by vacuum machine sucked the whole water out, so I didn't feel the seats being wet. They also cleaned my dashboard and all the plastic components in the car and I beloved waxed them as well. Overall, very happy with their service. Just I wish they had a bigger waiting room with a TV for entertainment. They had a WiFi, fortunately, and since I bought my iPad with myself, I was not bored, so keep in mind to bring some sort of entertaining with yourself. Also, I wish they give you the chance to see the process; while a small monitor was showing the security cameras, so I think they can easily wire the cameras to a TV, so people can watch their cars being cleaned!
