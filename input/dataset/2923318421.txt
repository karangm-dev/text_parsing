One of the nicest shopping areas around. And with the addition of the Scottsdale Quarter directly across the street, one of the best shopping/restaurant areas in the country.  Tommy Bahama's, Ocean Club, iPic, Apple Store, Zinc, Ra and numerous other restaurants and stores in both locations.  If you are in Scottsdale, a must visit.
