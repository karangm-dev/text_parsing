This review is for SERVICE.My experience at Superstition Springs Lexus service was negative.  There was a lack of follow through, poor communication with me and between staff.  Overall, the service department is disorganized.  I did not pay for the service I received due to the service department's mistake.  This needed to be approved by the service manager.  However, the service manager never followed up with me personally even though he knew that I had difficulties with my experience.  I believe the individuals that assisted me, Angel and Sergio, are friendly and sincere.  But the poor follow through and poor communication speak to the service department needing additional staff in order to meet the needs of the customers in a manner that provides effective service.
