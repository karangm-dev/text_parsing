While impressive in scale and presentation (yes, that's one large room of food), the quality of the dishes was fairly average.From a pretty poor imitation of dim sum dishes to soggy pizza and supbar sushi, I couldn't really bring myself to eat plate after plate like all of the other starry eyed guests.But I will say that the breakfast stations were BANGIN'. Red velvet waffles with honey vanilla whipped cream cheese and some ridiculously tasty eggs benedict redeemed the buffet for me.But that's not all. The desserts were just beautiful - and some tasted as exquisite as they looked. The cheesecake and carrot cake were two classic favorites along with some gorgeous strawberry tartlets. Other desserts were lovely but nearly flavorless. Overall I probably wouldn't return, just because I'm not particularly enticed by buffets and the price tag is high for an all-you-can-eat meal where I only end up with one plate.
