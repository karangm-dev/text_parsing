It isn't real Indian food.  I thought the food was unusually sweet, like they were putting too much sugar in it, which is a trick restaurants use to get you to like otherwise average food.  Nice atmosphere.  Iced tea was really good.  Salad greens were not super fresh.  Chicken was sparse in Tikka Masala.  Cooked vegetables were overcooked. Raita was soooo sweet I couldn't eat it.  There are a bunch of 5 star reviews, but be careful, because they are offering gift certificates for Yelp reviews. They had a "restaurant consultant" there who was driving the turnaround of this place, which is by the same people who did the failed Bombay Spice.  They are definitely playing the Yelp game.  I am not saying this place was terrible or anything... just not remotely authentic and pretty average despite all the pumped up Yelp reviews.  I would give it 3 stars were it not for all the Yelp gaming they are doing, which for me knocks it down another star.
