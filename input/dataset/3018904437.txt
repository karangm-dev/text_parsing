I really like this place. All the food was good except the spicy tuna chips. It was too sweet. The yellowtail capacio was very tasty. The waitress was super friendly & bubbly. The decor was very modern like tge way I like it. The food is a little pricy but worth it. I will definitely come back again for dinner again.
