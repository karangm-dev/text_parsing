I have a CRAZY confession to make.... I hate Whole Foods! I especially hate this Whole Foods. I don't get the love.. sorry people.*Their salad bar SUCKS. Nothing is fresh and they don't carry any of the items I enjoy that other Whole Foods always have (ie the one on Charleston) such as Tomato/mozzerella salad or Chicken Caesar. Their cottage cheese is runny and gross.*Prices.. ok I know they for some reason are justified in having markups, but honestly some of this is highway robbery. I adore Menage a Trois wine. I typically buy it at Smith's for between 6.99 and 8.99 a bottle. Why does Whole Foods charge 16.99 a bottle? WTF. I hate you Whole Foods*Prepared food isn't that good! Pizza.. sucks.. (come on Settebello is in the same parking lot!), pasta.. awful and inedible. Sandwiches are just OK.. Just ok for these prices? come on. Sushi .. eww. Nothing is that good or worth eating at these prices. *I've found expired salsa on their shelves.. expired by a freaking YEAR. I know most grocery stores have issues, but that's pretty ridiculous.. check your shelves more than once a year when you're charging such obscene prices.I just don't get it guys.. I think the organic trend is all fake anyways, but that being said I think wasting money on subpar food is ridiculous to me. Smith's, Trader Joe's.. don't worry, I won't waste my time at this craphole anymore.
