I have a 2013 Lexus ES350 I normally take to someone else for oil changes but since SSL is open on weekends and its really the only time I have to do this I made an appt. Experience was a little odd...the guy checking me in didn't seem to know if my car requires service every 5 or 10k miles so he confirms 10....but the sticker on my window says 5k, Ok. It took almost 2 hours because I saw my car sit for 30+ min after it was done yet nobody can tell me why my car cannot be released to me. I had my 2 kids with me and a few people saw me standing around and wanted to know what my delay was. So my car sat on the side for 30+ minutes and apparently my paperwork was sent to the wrong person despite me asking several times where my car was and why its sitting there 30+ minutes waiting for me? A woman that works here wears dreads, facial piercings and jeans with holes in them. I wasn't sure if I was at a high end car dealership or a mosh pit. Because their facility is nice I am going to chuck this off as the dealership just having a bad day. They did do my oil change and wash my car so I will probably try them again.
