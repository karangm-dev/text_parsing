This store is awful. The dressing rooms are hot and dirty, the employees never greeted me or asked if I needed anything until I got till the register, no one knew where anything was, employees lacked common courtesy and training, and the bathrooms look like the haven't seen a good cleaning or renovation since the 90s.Forever 21 should have stuck with small stores. I will not be shopping at the Arrowhead location ever again.
