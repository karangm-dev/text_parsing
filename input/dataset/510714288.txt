The food here is pretty good, which is unfortunate because the service is so painfully slow. There is very rarely many people in the restaurant, but still expect to wait 45+ minutes for your food to arrive at your table. Even ordering takeout takes that long. I will intentionally wait 35+ minutes before even leaving my house to go pick it up and yet will still have to wait another 15-20 minutes once I get there. Add this to their fluctuating health inspection scores (they were down in the 80's this summer) and we've just stopped going.
