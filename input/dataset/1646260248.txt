This place isnt worth the 1 star. Uck.Not only did they take a lot of money and move us in to a home not cleaned or ready, there was a prior flood and MOLD!!!!!Just try to get the manager, LIANET on the phone ... Her secretary wont let you in. I understand the manager, lianet ricardo, is a fresh faced teenager but ... Shes horrible and rude to boot!!  The worst part is theyre affiliated with the terrible sportsmans royal weeklys. The place where drugs and police run rampid. DONT RENT HERE UNLESS YOU PLAN TO DO IT ALL YOURSELF!!! If you do, beware,The leasing agent, stacy, dumber than mud ( or on drugs), will promise you everything and never follows through ....
