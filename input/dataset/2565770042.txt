Dr. Martineau's initial visit to my house bought me 10 more days with my sweet Barley.  We were so thankful for each of those days with her.  We spent a lot of it putting drops in her eyes and sprinkling the powder on her food until day 9 came and she really took a turn.  She was no longer interested in any food, nothing worked.  She mostly just slept and it occurred to me that the only time she was comfortable was when she was sleeping... and that's no way to live, so I knew the time had come.  I called Dr. Martineau very early that morning and she came over that afternoon.  She was so kind, so gentle, and so sweet.  We were both beyond sad, but calm as we'd had all day to prepare and we had our plan ready to take her to the pet crematorium directly afterwards.  Dr. Martineau kindly explained each step, she told me what would happen, what to expect from Barley, how we'd know it was working and she was exactly right through every step.  It was quick and painless, Barley just never woke up from her nap.  As awful as it was, I kept silently praying that I hope someone will love me as much and have enough strength to be this strong when my time comes.  It simply couldn't have been any more peaceful or any more kind.  When it was over Dr. Martineau swaddled Barley and placed her very gently into her carrier for the ride to the crematorium.  She was like an angel in my time of need and though it was an absolutely awful circumstance, the service Dr. Martineau provided couldn't be topped.  She was spectacular in my moment of heartbreak and I'm so thankful to her for that.
