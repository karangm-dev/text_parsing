The original saks location in the south outlet mall was one of my favorite stores of all time. They actually had quality items you would find in Saks. The customer service was always friendly and professional. After saks moved to town square and premium north it has gone to complete crap. Quality has gone way downhill, everything has scuffs and marks all over it.  They don't do their 30%-40% off anymore. I walked in the store this morning and not one person greeted me. Walked into the fitting room area with 12 items, no one was their to greet me. Continued to shop for over an hour, I watched 2 employees loudly and inappropriately laugh and talk while pretending to clean the sales floor. I looked right at them, locked eyes with them and they did not say a word to me. I went to check out, no one was at the register. I stood waiting for someone while the 2 employees I mentioned earlier continued on with their conversation. Eventually 1 of them came over and said "i will ring you up". Which is exactly what he did, and nothing more. These types of experiences at off 5th seem to be the regular these days. I will keep my business at neiman marcus last call.
