OH MY!!!  You want to talk beef jerky, let's talk JoJos Jerky.  This is the best stuff ever made. Used to stop and get beef jerky from the store in Baker CA...we thought that was good, forget about it, that tastes like shoe leather, JoJos is perfect in every way.  My husband is hooked on Hell on Earth.  I have to stop by the Farmers Market every week to purchase bags, yes bags!!  Family and friends from CA request  it as well.I don't Yelp about anyting but this beef jerky is worth every Yelp it gets!!! They say it's be best beef jerky straight outta Las Vegas....It's the best beef jerky straight outta ANYWHERE!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!
