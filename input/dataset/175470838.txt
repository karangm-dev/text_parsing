Overpriced candy store.And I thought that Sweet Factory was expensive enough already. This place takes it to another level. I stopped by this place while checking out a bunch of casinos and I haven't had taffy in a long time so I chose a few and went to pay.I think I bought like 6 or 7 and nearly costed me $3. And on top of that some weren't even that good.Next time I have a need for some sweets I'll get some at 7-11.
