At first I thought this is a hole in wall kinda place. But the food was so disappointing. I ordered only two dishes (kungpo shrimp and mapo tofu) and even the rice was not well cooked.... It wasn't the best Chinese food let me begin with this.It turns out to be more like a neighbourhood, quick grab and go takeaway Chinese food. If you want something to just fill up your stomach, not caring if it's good or not, then you can order takeout from this place. They also pre deep fry the chicken balls, spring rolls and shrimp. Which means they double deep fry it again. But the waitresses and people here is very efficient. They clean fast, takes your order quick, and cooks it quick too. Still....don't think I'll be back anytime soon.
