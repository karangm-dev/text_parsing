I came here during my 21st birthday trip. We were on the guest list so we had to come before 10:30pm. We skipped the general line and went straight to the lady to take our name. Unfortunately, there was a mix up but the lady still let our group in. 10/10 for that. The club itself was really nice! We stayed on the dance floor and it wasn't too crowded! No one kept bumping into us or anything and the other guests were pretty nice! No one thought they were better than anyone at this club, unlike Hakkasan. This resulted in a very nice vibe. The drinks here were pricey, about $40 for two drinks, however, it was good and i was celebrating my birthday so eh, why not? The guest performance was logic and keep this in mind, all of the artists usually performs at 2AM! this is like every club! Hakkasan was the same with Zedd. So if you can, come party here as close as it is to 2AM. I definitely recommend this club. My party had a blast! Also, it wasn't as stuffy as other clubs since it had a patio like thing.
