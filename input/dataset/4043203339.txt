The young guy at the front door was very pleasant and helpful. After that, we received literally the worst service I have ever gotten in my life. Bartenders were rude and continuously bad mouthed us right in front of our faces. I have never seen anyone in the service industry seem this annoyed by having customers at their bar. We even had a former Salt Cellar employee with us. We will not return. Too bad because the food was excellent as always.
