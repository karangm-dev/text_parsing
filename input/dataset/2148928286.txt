Fukuburger has been around since the first generation of food trucks in Las Vegas. Now they have a brick and mortar right in Chinatown where they first started off. Its got cool artwork on the interior, with an easy to read digital menu, but the dining space kinda is cramped.We shared a Fukuburger with Jazz Fries, and luckily we just ordered one burger to test it out. Everything sounds and looks great, but the taste and composition of our items just didn't impress me...not a fan of whatever additional seasoning/marinade is used in the patty, and the patty has an odd firm texture to it. The bun is supposed to keep everything in between in tact, but liquid from the patty and additional ingredients were soaked up from the bottom, and it was a soggy mess. Jazz Fries were not all that jazzy...more like a generic poutine without the cheese curds and mayo instead. Um....no.Fukuburger already has a loyal following, so I wish them nothing but the best...maybe the timing of my visit wasn't good (Team Fukuburger was catering at an Atlanta Falcons game in the ATL) so maybe quality and cosistency slipped a bit, who knows? I just hope that this place isn't jinxed from formerly being White Rabbit, and Fresh Cup before that.  ALOHA!!!Shaka Meter:  \uuu/  \uuu/  2
