Everything from the food to the service was fantastic. The staff was 100% courteous, friendly, and attentive the whole time. Glasses were never empty. Plates were cleared as soon as they were done. My dad forgot his reading glasses and couldn't read the menu, so our waiter brought out a pair so he could see. It's little details like that take a place from good to great. They even have a vegetarian menu, so my sister was especially pleased. My whole family enjoyed their meals. I got the lettuce wraps, which were great and the truffled mac and cheese as a side dish. The mac and cheese was heavenly, very rich and filling. Also the chocolate souffle for desert was incredible! Just the right amount of rich and gooey on the inside!Will absolutely return.
