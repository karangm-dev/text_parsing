Vanessa-the membership manager at this GYM needs a few classes on customer service. She's very unpleasant and rude.Vanessa came to help us with the wrong attitude I feel it's because when her co-workers called her over to help us,it interrupted her conversation she was having previously with other coworkers. Here's the deal Vanessa your job is to take care of members... and future potential members.My father and I are in town for a week, this particular gym is nearest to our vacation rental.My brother has a membership at LVAC we wanted him to join us working out. He has a seven day pass,took a while to find it.my dad pays the 1 day fee of 25$. Upon finding the seven day pass Vanessa says it's invalid clearly,it has dates on it and it's not expired.Vanessa claims she can't reverse the payment process! Meaning everyday we came,we'd have to pay for my brother to join us!!! Is this gym struggling that much for business??? Vanessa doesn't help in situations like this. In customer service the customer isn't always right but... You should do what you can to help the customer,such as acknowledge passes that aren't expired. My dad and I have been members of 24Hr fitness for years and we've never encountered such horrible service.I'd ask all my friends and family to not waste time or money coming here. Worst experience ever!
