Great service and wonderful baked goods. We ordered an assortment of pies to bring to a client meeting on Pi Day, and the person I spoke with over the phone recommended pecan, sour cherry (with a killer crumble on top), and chocolate mousse. They were all delicious. They even do a gluten-free chocolate torte.The best part was they were willing to deliver to our hotel for only $10 when our flights were delayed and we couldn't pick up on time. Love this place!
