Just saw my girl Arliss and I now have a fabulous moms-night-out worthy blowout.  The back of my head has never looked better!  Arliss gave me a spa-like shampoo with my choice of essential oil in the conditioner.  I chose spearmint.  So refreshing!  The blow out that followed was so relaxing I almost fell asleep in the chair.I followed Arliss from another salon because she seems to know intuitively what I want and she takes the time to get my hair just right.  I don't walk out until she's satisfied.  I'm lazy about my hair, so I need that stylist help.The ambience at Blowout Dollhouse is cheerful and girly.  Love it.  And now I've discovered the second floor at Tivoli Village.  I'm looking forward to coming back and checking out some of the other shops.  See you next week!
