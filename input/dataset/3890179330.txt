I don't normally like to do this, but I have to after the terrible experience I just had. Centurylink has the WORST customer service I've ever experienced. Two weeks ago I put in my order and the tech was scheduled to come in yesterday. Nobody showed up and nobody called to reschedule. Today I called, was on the phone for almost two hours, transferred to four people and was told they had to reschedule for Thursday, there was nothing they could do to help me earlier. I even talked to a supervisor who was the worst "supervisor" I've ever dealt with. Two hours later and I now have to wait until Thursday. Nobody apologized, nobody seemed to care. I told them if they don't come Thursday I'll be cancelling my service and going with Cox. Also, this whole time I was on their site talking with a live customer service rep online trying to figure this out, but all they told me was they couldn't do anything. So today's Worst Company Award goes to Centurylink.
