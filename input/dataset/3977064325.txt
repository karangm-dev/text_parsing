Monday I went to Super L Ranchmart COFCO center on 44th st, my thought was that I would buy some salmon and fresh produce for dinner.  I had not been to this store for about 4 years until today.  I have to begin by just saying that the service was awful, not once did anyone greet me or ask to help me.  The employees act as if they don't want to be there and that they are going out of their way. I also felt like the store was dirty and neglected.I was so disappointed in the produce section.  There was a limited supply of produce and the shelves were messing and unkept, I picked out some mushrooms but after looking them over they appeared old and tired. The entire store looked very neglected as if no one really cares about it.I then went to the fish market and waited with about 11 other people for help with my fish selection.  There were two employees, neither acted like they wanted to be there.  No one waiting was ever greeted or treated with much respect, no one stopped and apologized for the long wait.   Again the selection was meager, the salmon looked a day or two old and had a dull coloration. The fresh fish looked very unappetizing to me.  I thought about some fresh crab or lobster but the tank looked dirty and neglected too.  After waiting for about 10 minutes, I turned around and left the store.  There are many choices in the Valley for fresh sea food. I won't be back to that store at least not any time soon.
