Local breeze is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  My bf and I go all the time for brunch, and they also have really good burgers too.  My favorite part about this place is that they have a dog friendly patio.  They usually bring the dogs little dog bowls with water and sometimes even a cookie!  Try the coca cola ham omelet for brunch....AH-MAZING!
