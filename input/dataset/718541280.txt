There's not much to say that hasn't been said. Not bad drunk food when on State, but there are way better sub places in town. I'd take Milio's over Jimmy John's any day. The bread is way better. Erberts and Gerberts along with Which Wich have fare more options and interesting subs. If this is the only thing open, sure go ahead and eat here. Otherwise check out a different restaurant.
