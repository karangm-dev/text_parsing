Too busy for new students? My girls & I were excited at the idea of taking a class at CAPA Dance with the possibility of buying packages for additional classes. Online schedule directs you to call for the Pole class. Two voicemails and an email later, no response. We have never been to this school but have now found alternatives.  Thanks but no thanks now.
