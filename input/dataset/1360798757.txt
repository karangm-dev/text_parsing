I used to go here frequently, but I got sick of being charged for every extra thing (peppers, sour cream, etc).  In the end Chipotle ends up being higher quality AND cheaper if you get the extras.  On top of that, their hours are all over the place.  Chipotle is open more frequently.The only reason to go here now is the Queso burrito, but the downsides outweigh the good.  It's worth waiting in line at Chipotle.
