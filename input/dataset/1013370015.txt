Words cannot describe. AMAZING! Best Cirque show I have EVER seen. Highly recommend!We had just had our nuptials and to celebrate, I chose this show. (Pats self on back). We were sporting our wedding attire. The crowd greeted us with congratulations and asked us to kiss--we did. My husband had never been to a Cirque show prior. Hands down it was the BEST show he has ever seen. (Yay for me and my choice--in both my husband and this show) His favorite band is the Beatles so it was a total win-win.There is NO bad seat in the house. We did not go cheap on tickets nor did we go all out. We had a great view of everything. My mouth was open the entire time in awe (he sang every song out loud).If you are thinking of taking in one Cirque show...see Love. You will have a wonderful time!1,000 Halley puppies dance in unison!
