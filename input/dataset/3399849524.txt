Charlie and his wife are so talented! More importantly, he is very patient, kind, and offers reasonable prices. I am incredibly indecisive, but I gave him a very general gist of what I wanted. He told me to trust him and I'm so glad I did! I have had gel manicures consistently for years and tried many different places. He is definitely one of the best! So anyways, when he tells you to trust him...just trust him. He won't disappoint you. Four women, including my sister and I, left ecstatic. He may juggle a lot, but he works diligently and with great attention to detail. Oh, and he was even kind enough to stay after hours (after midnight!) so he could work us in. So grateful to have found them.
