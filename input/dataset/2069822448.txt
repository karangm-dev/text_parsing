Let me start off by saying service was beyond awesome here. The first dish I ordered, I did not realize was finished in the pan, and fried. I hate friend, or pan friend fish period. I told the waiter what I wanted. The only fish they had not friend or finished in the pan was the halibut. So the chef made a special halibut dish for me int he over that was seriously, to die for!
