I bought the latex mattress from sleepeZ since I wanted a mattress that would not off gas and give off a strong chemical smell. they claimed to have organic and natural materials that are non toxic in their bed. Well we got our mattress over a month ago, and it still smells like wet hay and some other chemical smell that I cannot describe. My baby sleeps with us and when she wakes up, her hair and clothes still smell like the mattress. I've tried airing it out many times, and while it has improved slightly, the smell is still there! I know I'm still within the return warranty period (90days) but how am I supposed to roll up these heavy latex layers and make them fit into boxes?? The company sends them wrapped in bags that are like vacuum sealed (I'm pretty sure they have machines that help them pack these things). In addition, they staple the boxes with these huge staples because I'm sure tape isn't strong enough to keep the latex from expanding and ripping the box. It is impossible for me to do that on my own, and just thinking about the trouble of packing up, and paying 100 dollars to return, I've been holding it off and praying that the smell will go away. But it doesn't. I have to wash my sheets everyday because i can't stand the smell. It's not even latex smell. The pillows do smell like latex and those are fine now, but the smell on the mattress is different! I'm so disappointed because this is the reason why I got rid of my old memory foam mattress and I'm stuck with this new odor. Not sure if it's the wool, or the latex, or something else. But it seriously has a strong chemical smell mixed with stinky wet hay. I just hope it's non toxic and it goes away soon. I'm so confused because no one else has complained about this.
