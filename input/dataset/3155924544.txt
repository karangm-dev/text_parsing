Focus Plumbing is my go-to plumbing company. Jim, is the technician who was able to diagnose the problem with the hot water side of my master bathroom tub, when two other loan plumbing companies could not. Now, we finally get to enjoy one of the best features in the house. Jim took the time to diagnose the problem, order the appropriate parts, then follow up to see that the repair was completed. Thanks to Focus and Jim for following through, where the other companies were just looking for a quick, easy fix, and off to the next job. Plus, Jim put his booties on when he entered my home, and took them off and on as he entered and exited...a real plus in my book.
