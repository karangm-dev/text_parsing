This is unbelievable! I was just charged a 30 dollar "annual fee" which I was never made aware of. I have had more issues with non-disclosure with this gym that I will be closing my membership. I would rather pay more every month at another gym than to deal with a company that lies and doesn't tell you up front about extra fees! This is outrageous.
