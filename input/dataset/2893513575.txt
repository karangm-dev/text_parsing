SO EXTREMEELEY frustrated and dispointed. Run dont walk. I have been a customer for three years. I dont know what happened it used to be good but now its a disgrace. Worst customer service ever, incompentant and lazy. they have basically caused my dog to be delayed his medicine for over two weeks and still I havent recieved it. They tell you 5 days then a week later when you call : oh i dont see that order in the system blah blah let me call you back. they never call back. Then I had them expediate the shipment. Three days later i have to call these idiots and the same thing: i dont see any notes on that. WTF supervisor never calls back then i get a voicemail oh please call us back so we can discuss shipment options. WTF still havent sent it. I feel like suing these a-holes. Dont trust this company with your pets livlihood they dont care anymore. Maybe it has new managment idk but its a disgrace.
