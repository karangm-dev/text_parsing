First time here and everything was amazing. What a wonderful little gem we found in this place. Looks like not much out front but it's very charming and original in back. Beautiful patio and food was fabulous. Lunch today but we will be back to try more.  Breakfast looks incredible. Plus, they are Detroit Tiger fans!  Added bonus!!!
