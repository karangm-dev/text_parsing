I agreed to take an earlier appointment which took a week 1/2 to get. I got rushed out after my daughter got her X-rays because they had other patients come in. Which I could've gotten everything taken care in one visit. Then I had to schedule a new appointment an additional week out. My daughter likes the way she was treated but their scheduling sucks!!!!
