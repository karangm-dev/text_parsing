I'm honestly confused. I don't understand how this place has 4 stars. The ingredients were very fresh, which I was very happy about. However, completely flavorless. I ordered the chicken naked burrito. The guacamole didn't taste like much, rice was bland, chicken lacked flavor. Very disappointing :(
