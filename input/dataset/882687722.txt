Do NOT live here. It looks ok on the outside, but dealing with management is reason enough not to choose The Sycamore. Instead of mailing my deposit to me after I moved out, they gave over $250 to a roommate whose name is not on the lease. After being a responsible tenant, they gave away MY money. Phone calls are rarely if ever returned here, and I feel they are dishonest and dismissive with anything involving money. Policies and answers are not consistent. I was told 3 separate times that they would mail my check to me only to find that they had given it to another person. They took no responsibility and basically told me it was my problem. Not worth all the headaches and dishonesty.
