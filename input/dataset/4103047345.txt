Come several times a month. Never fails us. We like sitting at the Bar (booths). Always same two waitresses They are Professionals. Fast. Friendly. Always checking.  Oh the food...... Roadhouse is Great on all. The 6oz is enough for me. Always perfectly done. Ribs have lots of meat. Get the loaded baked potato. Worth it. Salads always the freshest.  Lots of TVs in bar but not too loud. Just great place.
