Came the same day!  Honest and you can tell he loves doing what he does.  I would give him ten stars!  He wasn't able to get the job done because of some other issues that he came across.  I loved the honesty and he didn't even charge us even though he was at the house for about three hours.  He recommended someone for us to fix the problem and we will definitely have him come clean the ducts once the other problem is fixed!  I highly recommend him!!
