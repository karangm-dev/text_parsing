We walked in at 10:15p and the first thing they say to us is "kitchen closes at 11p." Not a real good first impression. And then every 5 min the waitress came over to see if we were ready to order. Now I do realize (as a previous restaurant manager) your staff is always ready to close up as early as possible if they can. So I realize that   a party of 4 walking in 45min before kitchen close might prevent that, but at no time should you make your customers feel that way.I would have given them 1 star, however the food really was good. Too bad the service was lacking. Unfortunately, I'll never come back. But if you decide to, don't make the same mistake we did. Go during peak dinner hours. I'm sure their service is impeccable then.
