Check out Mary Lou Coady at the Beauty Boutique in this Shoppers Drug Mart.  She is what makes this yelper rereview this location at 5 stars.I needed last minute shopping ideas before my Christmas party on Christmas Eve, and we all know how busy stores can be.  Well Mary Lou knows her store inside and out, she gave me 3 or 4 ideas for affordable gift items for the last members on my Christmas list plus the personalised service needed to feel like I was the only client in the store.  She actually brought me down a couple of different aisels outside of the Beauty Boutique  to show me some gift ideas which were on sale in places that I would have missed if I didn't know where to look.I got a great Clinique gift set for my cousin, which included a lotion, make-up removal, lippy, mascara, eyeshadow set and body wash for only $35.  And not only that it came in this ubber classy white and silver bag which she could use to go shopping or even use at an elegant dinner date, it was that nice.Mary Lou has got me hooked to come back for other gift ideas at the local Shoppers, who would have thought?
