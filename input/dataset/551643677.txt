I hate this fucking stinky ghetto shithole. My car was broken into here in broad daylight. There's always unsavory characters lolling about, and that's just the people that work there. They roll one distrustful eye up towards you (the other obscured by emo fringe) and glare at you for even daring to disturb them. As for the people that shop here, if you stand too close, you will probably catch lice and get exposed to tuberculosis in one shot. Every time I come here, without fail, there is some sorry sack of shit at the pharmacist counter, trying to convince them they just "lost" their written prescription for Vicodin, or their Percocets got "stolen", all with Emmy-award winning shows of anguish and pain. So you're asking now why I even come here, and I don't blame you. I work long hours, and this is the closest 24-hour pharmacy to my humble abode. Sometimes, a girl doesn't have time to  drive to a first-world facility. What can I do, except clutch my bag extra close, scared-old-lady style, and take an extra long shower with extra disinfecting soap when I get home.
