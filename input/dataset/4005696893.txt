A prescription was called in to my pharmacy for me. The doctor on the script was not one that i had ever seen.....and no one bothered to call me with my test results which might be why the medicine was prescribed? I dont know. No one has ever called me with results. I dont know what i am being treated for and cannot get through extremely long on hold to ask who the doctor is that prescribed medicine for me and for what condition i am being treated for.
