I am amazed everyday by the expansion of frozen yogurt into Toronto, it definitely makes me very happy to see that people are switching towards slightly healthier food choices!Unfortunately, yogurty's doesn't compare to their competition in the most important part of their business. Their product is limited by the poor consistency and VERY low melting point! It would also be nice to see whether they use liquid or powder mix to produce their froyo, but given the characteristics of their product the latter is more likely.The positives of their business is the location and their hours. Price point wise they are following the trend.If I really had the urge to get some froyo I'd make a date down to head to Spadina/Bloor to hit up YoYo!Sorry Yogurty's, nothing personal, but gotta step up your game if you want my earned dollars maybe you'd get them if I still went to BSS.
