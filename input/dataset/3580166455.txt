I asked my server a question about the menu, he said he had no idea and said he would give me a minute to think about what else I wanted- How about an answer to my question??!! . He didn't offer to ask someone else or MAYBE EVEN THE KITCHEN?!! (Hmmmm...Who would have thought the kitchen might know something about the menu?) Anyway, I was so annoyed that I was over it and just wanted to walk out. I WONT BE BACK. Ps their MENU IS REALLY LIMITED and I could have gotten better food at Denny's. 1 extra star only because I liked the decor, otherwise I would have given this place 1 star.
