We loved this restaurant!  Overall, the staff was helpful and friendly.  Our server helped us figure out the right amount of food for our group of 5.  The food came quickly, but was spaced out well so we could enjoy it all.  Everything was delicious - especially the underdog, the tempura cauliflower.  We all would highly recommend this restaurant!
