Eggslut...you had me eating every last crumb! This is located inside the Cosmopolitan. We came here for breakfast and waited in a pretty long line. They have the menu in a couple spots so you can already start drooling over what you want. My husband has had Eggslut before, but for me this was a first. I ordered the Bacon, egg, and cheese. It was literally the best breakfast sandwich I have had. Whatever sauce they used is what made the sandwich. The bacon was crisp and the bun was fluffy yet firm. My husband ordered the Gaucho sandwich which he says they don't have over where we live. He loved it as well and said it beats out all the other stuff he has tried.They were quick with orders and also serve beer! Which is a good tip since your in Vegas and I am sure you might want one in the morning. The water is also a little cheaper than the surrounding vendors.
