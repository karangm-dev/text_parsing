My girlfriend and I have been waiting to get into this restaurant for along time. We looked forward to it even more since the reviews on Michael Simons show. We arrived at 915 on a Tuesday night, the location had a few tables full and a few bar patrons. The staff was fast, friendly and courteous. And we were seated in a booth which we asked for instead of a table. The menu was described and this concept of community food sharing. This is even better with expectations of portion size for the prices they charge. Sadly we got shrimp and grits and sliders and a flatbread all over 10 dollars. When they came out our mouth dropped and we both said to each other, where is the rest of our food. Portions siZe was small, very small for price. Three small sliders for 15 bucks, a tiny flat bread for around 12 that had four pieces that were not even three bites. The shrimp and grits were quality but again small for the price. Our bill was high stomachs still hungry. The food was high quality but to small for the price by almost double what should have Been charged for expectations. Overall high quality food, good service just not worth the outlandish prices.
