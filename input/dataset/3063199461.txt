I opted for the Lost in Chocolate 10 inch cheesecake for my family and we loved it! It was one of the most decadent desserts I've ever eaten. I chose the flavor, placed a phone order, and in 48 hours we were enjoying our cheesecake. Customer service was wonderful from the employee taking my phone order to the delivery man. They mentioned they are working on a storefront but right now it's a cheesecake delivery concept. I had a great experience from start to finish and I would recommend this business for those seeking delicious cheesecake.
