Well an update. I guess you can't have license plates on your car without fear of someone stealing them. Brought the amount of theft we've had to the attention of the office and was literally shrugged at! Didn't even notate that something happened or take a report of it or really was offered an apology. All I was asked is if I filed a police report and then they proceeded to put it back on me as if it was my fault! Long story short again still not happy and absolutely nothing has changed. Don't waste your money.
