I've been to my share of vegas buffets. This one was very disappointing. Even with a buffet credit, I wouldn't do this buffet again. The food was bland, cold, and lacked authenticity. You'd be better off at Dennys. However, if you take a chance on this buffet-- make sure you have the croissants french toast and if you want chocolate milk mix the 2% with the chocolate. Lol
