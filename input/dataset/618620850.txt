My husband and I have been dying to go here since it opened. We finally had our chance this past Memorial Day Weekend and I am not so convinced I will return.My parents warned me it would be loud, and it was. VERY loud. You might as well be sitting in Carnival Court when you dine on the patio. My husband and the Triple B Burger, which he liked, and I had the Bacon Mac N Cheese Burger-which I could not wait to try. The burger was good, the fries had far too much seasoning-even my husband thought so. With everything being "good" I simply expected better. I tried it, but don't need to return.
