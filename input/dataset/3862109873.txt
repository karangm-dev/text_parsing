Not the greatest place in the world, there food is boring and greasy and the girls dont really have a personality. There are better hooters to go to that will give you more for your money. The wings have no flavor really-you ask for hot and it seems like you get mild or wimp. The staff is friendly enough but not friendly enough to frequent this location. The girls dont have "hooters" and they have like on cook in the kitchen. Not the worst place, but not the best.
