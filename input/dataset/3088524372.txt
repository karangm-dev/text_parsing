Total time twiddling my thumbs = 2 hours! My journey of waiting started in the lobby. Time ticked by, as I tried to entertain myself. Repeated glances at my phone, looking up at the TV. Before I knew it an hour had ticked by. The waiting continued, as I was taken in the back to the next chair that'd I'd wait in to see this infamous dentist. "Hello", said the doctor after waiting an hour and a half. He checked out my teeth, and concluded with "wait here, I'll be right back." I was greeted by the bill of what might be done with my teeth. I approved, but was met with, "we'll have to have you come back in at a later date." I questioned him asking if my teeth would see any attention today, but he replied with, "the dentist had a doctors appointment today."In the end, I waited 2 hours to not even get my teeth cleaned.
