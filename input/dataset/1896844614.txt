I saw Don Rickles there. He was great, amazing timing. You knew the lines were coming but he made them funny every time.The theater is very nice. We sat far left (stage right) and could see and hear perfectly. My suggestion, though, would be not to sit on the side like we did. We saw Rickles fine but the piano player's back was to us the whole show and the orchestra was on the other side of the stage. Because of this the opening act singer stayed on the other side of the stage so that the music would be behind him. As for Rickles, he couldn't really make it to our side of the stage.
