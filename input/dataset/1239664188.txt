Literally the WORST place I have gone for acrylic nails. The nail "technician" was unable to cut the nail evenly, or apply the colour correctly. There is a huge gap of space between the actual acrylic and the skin, I got it done today and it looks a week grown out. Every time I commented asking it to be fixed she would sigh and never actually fix it. I am now left with uneven, bumpy nails. DO NOT get your nails done here. *** ADDING ON TO "REVIEW" DOWN BELOW*** You must be out of your mind. The nail technician did a terrible job. I wouldn't have to ask to have the first layer of polish re done if she had done a proper job in the FIRST place. Totally unacceptable nail service, I could have painted it better myself. Why is that I have gone to other salons and have never had them done that way? They have always looked the way they are supposed to look. Regardless if the polish is not shellac, it is not supposed to be painted on poorly with a huge space in between. Never have received acrylics looking like that from ANY other salon. I doubt you are a customer and wouldn't be surprised if you were an actual employee.
