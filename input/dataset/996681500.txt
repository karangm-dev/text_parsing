This company is absolutely horrible! They are complete crooks!!!!!!They did not tell me about the $39 fee just to come out. So they showed up asking for $39 on the spot. They put a ball valve on the outside of my house. Which he made it seem would take an hour or two, 10 minutes later he was done and charge me $195! Then the company said because it was same day service and it was by a highly trained technician.Total bullshit!!!Never ever ever use this company!!!!!
