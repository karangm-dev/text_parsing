What a disappointment! We were looking forward to have this company come out and qoute us for a remodel and they texted me 10 mins before my appointment to give me a quote over the phone. Seriously? He said they over booked him. If you can't even come to my home and give me a quote why should we spend thousands of dollars on a remodel with your company? I understand things happen but you text me 10 mins before an appointment to tell me about a double booking. Then try to give me a quote over the phone! LAZY company! Take caution when working with this company.
