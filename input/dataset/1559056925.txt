I would never come back to this location, every time I come,I encounter myself to be served by JAY, the manager. He reduces the portion of food to the point that you barely get food on your plate. I had to laugh and go, leaving my food on the counter. It's not the first time it has happened to me. He has to learn what is the right portion of food to be served. I don't want anything extra for free, I just want what I usually get at Panda. He has no idea of customer service and when you talk to him he just  reply with a sarcastic smile. It happened today, 8/28/2017 at 2:50 pm. Due to the inconvenience I had to drive all the way to Fashion Show Mall to have Panda at the food Court. Not a happy customer
