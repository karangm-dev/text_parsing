I "YELPED" to find the phone number that wasn't in my phone for some reason and was dismayed to see the negative reviews.  I was unable to see my regular tech, but Carissa is just as awesome as Senthia. I had one of the monthly special pedicures and the new Shellac treatment to my nails. Senthia had recommended it bc I am so rough on my hands and have excess oils in my nailbeds so traditional polish doesn't last too long. The only problem I could see today, were the other patrons, one screaming on her cell phone, the other just screaming in general. All issues aside, it's still totally worth going because I know I won't get any infection from their pedicure tubs, like others that have "funk, disease, regenerating whirlpools. I'll pay extra not to get MRSA!ps. I think those that have complained about the older lady screaming at them are just unaware that she can't hear very well and is German, you might just be dealing with language/cultural barriers. I've been going here since they opened and know that she's very sweet and has an amazing story)
