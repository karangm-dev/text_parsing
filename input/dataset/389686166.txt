Our rescue schnoodle has many issues, one of which is separation anxiety. The Pet Spa received accolades from our Next Door community website, so I stopped by to discuss our little guy's needs. Connie showed sincere interest in grooming him. The results were great, both in the way he looks and his demeanor. We will definitely return to this business. Thank you!
