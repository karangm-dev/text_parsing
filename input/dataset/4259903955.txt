I would never recommend any of these facilities to any parent. I was taking my son to the Horizon Ridge location, and not only are their staff unprofessional, but they put my child in danger on a number of occasions. The first incident happened when my son was only 6 weeks old. The teacher, Ms. Taylor, had my son in a bouncy chair on the floor unattended while other children that are well over 1 year of age are walking around. One of the older children belly flopped on my son twice as I watched from their online cameras. When the older child jumped on him I realized she had my son's bottle propped up in his mouth, because she was too lazy to hold him while he hate. The older child then took his bottle and walked around with it for a few minutes before she took it from him and stuck it back in my child's mouth without sanitizing it first. Not only is this unsanitary, but I could not believe what I had just witnessed. When I spoke with Kristin, the so called "director" of the facility she said it was a lack of judgement and would not happen again. She was extremely rude about the situation and made it seem like it was no big deal. On two other occasions I had picked up my son and realized that his bottles were completely melted on the bottom of them. When asked what happened their staff said they did not notice this. I don't understand how you could NOT notice the bottles were melted when you held him to feed him. How hot was the milk they fed him if they did not notice they were melted? I pulled him out that same day when they had him in a high chair unattended, with the teacher across the room, when he was only 2 months old. He couldn't even sit up on his own!!!! Please do not take your children here!!
