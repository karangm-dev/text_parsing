I'd had my oil changed and car wash done here a few times.  This past time, I was told I MUST USE SYNTHETIC OIL.  I wanted regular oil.  I was told that if I used regular oil, I'd void my warrantee of my lease car.  I asked how he knew what my warrantee was like.  He stated (as if it were fact) that all cars past 2016 had to use synthetic oil.I paid $60 for the work.I called my dealer and they said that there's NOTHING saying I HAD to have synthetic oil and that the Francis and Sons employee flat out LIED to me to spend twice as much as I needed to.  I called them and asked for two free regular oil changes to make it right.  They refused.  DON'T USE FRANCIS AND SONS!
