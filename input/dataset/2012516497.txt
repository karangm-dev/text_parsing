I was SO excited when this DD moved into my neighborhood. I drove by it every day and I was there the second they opened for their Grand Opening. On my first time there, I was very pleasantly greeted by their staffwho asked if I was a regular. It must've been the way I ordered my coffee. I have continued to go there every week since they have opened, but I know that quite a few things have changed and it's really bothering me. This review is strictly on the customer service that I am beginning to really dislike. Not one person looks like they are happy to work here, and they make me feel like I am completely inconveniencing them. I thought for sure from the very first day that this was going to be a great DD to go to. Everyone is so personable at the other two locations I visit, and I guess I thought this one would be the same. If this sour attitude and unhappiness continues, I will take my business elsewhere.
