From the get go I knew it was going to be slow. It took ten minutes to get our drinks and there was only maybe 15 people there at 6:30 on a Friday night. Took around 30 minutes for our table of five to get our food and my buddies beer tasted strange. Had to ask our waitress three times to get to refill my drink. Other waitresses were sitting around playing on their phone and not attentive to incoming customers. Food was alright but wish our service was better.
