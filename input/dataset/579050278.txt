Bartender was the only part of the night that was decent. The food was horrible the burger was overcooked they seemed understaffed the fish and chips was OK but the problem was there was a long wait for "all you can eat" the menu was nothing like it used to be the live band was to loud for a bar so small some of the staff was rude and inattentive we used to come quite often too a while off tonight was the first time back and will most likely be the last. Very disappointing
