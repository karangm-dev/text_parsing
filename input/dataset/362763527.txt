Authentic New York Style Deli.  This is in the back of the New York New York Casino.  It looks amazing, it's down an alley way and by the time you get there, you feel like you're really in New York.The sandwiches here are amazing.  The biggest Reuben I've ever eaten.  But also amazingly tasty.  Me and my wife were able to share one sandwich. Worth coming back to.
