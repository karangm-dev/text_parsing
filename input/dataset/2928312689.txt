EASILY my favorite Chinese delivery in Old Town Scottsdale. This is the only place I get delivery from and I have never had a bag experience. My girlfriend and I always get orange chicken, sweet and sour pork, lo mein, and fried rice and it is great every time. We have also had their sweet and sour chicken, which is my "test item" for every Chinese place, and it is delicious as well. Delivery is very prompt and the service is friendly. Big fan of Yummy Yummy!!
