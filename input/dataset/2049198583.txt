Avoid wasting your time and money at the Marvel S.T.A.T.I.O.N. You wait in front of an elevator to go up to the "experience" where you complete task to train to be an agent. The employee waiting with us, continued stopping to tell us what to do, to tell us how tired she was. That her five month old kept her up all night. The employees seemed like they would have rather you didn't bother coming in. The last areas where you finally have more interactive games, were a disappointment. The employee running the Iron Man flying game refused to change the height of the game to fit each person. He continued to use the same sanitizing wipe to clean the machine after each person. All you could hear was the employee on the other side of the wall screaming to shot and fire on your last challenge which interrupted what you were trying to hear on your headset. Talking about the headset, we switched my husbands head set because the one side didn't work to get another broken set. Sad excuse for 6 month old equipment. The whole experience was disappointing and over priced. I wish I would have read more reviews before I wasted my time and money.
