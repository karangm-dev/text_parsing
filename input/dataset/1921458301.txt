Simply the best Beauty Bar in Old Town Scottsdale!  I, and everyone that comes to visit me, have enjoyed numerous and wonderful pedicures - so luxurious with their reclining massaging chairs and the professional lovely care of Rachelle and Tami. I have also enjoyed a Lash Lift with Chanel which was great. Luminosa now has a Massage therapist and also a Reiki therapist - I can't wait to experience these services soon. Excellent!
