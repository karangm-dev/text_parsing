I bought this deal and the owner had no idea what it was and double charged me.  It took 3 phone calls and then he credited me what i spent for it, not the $150 I should have received.  I see this deal is still up there - I don't know why.  As far as the carpet cleaning went - he did a good job.  Just don't buy the deal.
