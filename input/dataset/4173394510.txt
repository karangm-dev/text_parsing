I recently tried CoCo Bubble Tea on a whim, since it was the closest bubble place to where I was eating at.I've never tried CoCo before neither had I had a Pearl Milk Bubble Tea by myself since I've always been worried if I've gotten lactose intolerant, but I was fine and didn't react badly.At first taste, I fell in love instantly with how smooth the milk tea was! I've tried the Milk Tea from Chatime as well, but it just doesn't taste as smooth as CoCo's!I always shake my bubble tea before I poke the straw in, since sometimes all the ingredients fall to the bottom, or if the ice doesn't mix properly with the tea yet! My drink is the most basic bubble tea flavour... It's the equivalent symbolism as getting a Caramel Frappuccino from Starbucks, hahaha!!If you can't tell yet, I've been obsessed with CoCo and their Pearl Milk Tea.. I've been there about 3 times in the last month, which is a lot for me, haha.I went back again with E and she got the January Special which was the Red Bean Matcha Milk Tea. It was only $3.80 for a Large size, thanks to the promo! My Pearl Milk Tea in Regular size is usually about $4 (without tax), so their tea of the month promo is pretty amazing!I've also been getting my bubble teas with less sugar (50% sugar), and sometimes with less ice. Because I've been trying to cut back on sugar. Key word: trying .PS: CoCo has a Vicinity membership point card, which is the same as Chatime - so you can use the same card to collect more points! So useful since I don't want to carry different loyalty cards. At bubble tea places, they don't usually prompt you if you have a membership card, so I usually ask or show them my card before tapping to receive my points. :)
