I love this place!! We've been going here since the transition from the old to the new owners. They have an  amazing selection and will gladly order something for you. And the food... don't get me started on the food. It is amazing!!! Some of the best Greek food I've ever had. Their prices are very reasonable and the lunch specials come with a ton of food. They are incredibly friendly and generous and truly love their customers.
