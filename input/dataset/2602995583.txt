Really wanted to like this place but it failed on so many levels.  First, upon arrival we were told that the draft beer was not working.  (Bummer but not terrible.)  So, we ordered Kilt Lifter in bottles and were told that they don't have any Kilt Lifter either.  Huge disappointment since this is (A.) a 'beer co' and (B.) a 'Grayhawk' company -- you should carry local beer.  So we shrugged our shoulders and ordered food instead.  The menu was really disappointing but we found things to order.  When the food arrived, it was mediocre.  Not awful, but not delicious at all.  If it weren't raining outside, we would have left.  We finished lunch with a consensus that we'll never be back nor will we recommend this place.  Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers was much more fun, lively, and offered a better menu.  The decor of this new 'beer company' was confusing.  Subdued colors and accents (like a high-end coffee shop) and meals are served on tin trays (ala prison.)  The TV's that were working had a variety of infomercials playing while no popular games appeared.  Is this sports bar?  Is this a joke?  As we were one of two tables in the entire place on a Saturday at noon -- I'm assuming we aren't alone in our thoughts.  Overall -don't bother and don't waste your money.  Enjoy a better experience and meal across the parking lot at Chipotle, Which Which, or Pei Wei.  Or drive the mile or so South and go to Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers in their new location.
