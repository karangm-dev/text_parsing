Its almost worth the 4 hour drive from So Cal just to go eat here! They have such a wide variety of foods and desserts, all of the food is delicious not the typical Buffet foods. Beer and wine is included. The lines are almost always super long to get in but I think its worth the wait. They are price more than $30 per person for dinner, but also worth it!My favorite part of this buffet is the desserts they have Tiramisu, lemon meringue tarts, flan, cheesecake, a variety of gelatos, and many more.
