After one month trouble with the unit! But the service has been continuously poor. Now on a Saturday in the heat of Arizona's summer, we had to call numerous times to get someone to call back to tell us they can't come for hours. They need to have service people in the summer!! Now after waiting hours still nobody!!~ With all the companies out there who needs this kind of aggravation after spending 8000.00. They have since fired the installers who were so terrible and made good on everything!!!
