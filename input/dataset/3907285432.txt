Mr. Hammond was the seller's agent and I was the buyer.  At the very least, one would think the seller's agent would do whatever it took to make the selling process go smoothly in the interest of closing the transaction.  However, it seemed Mr. Hammond decided he would throw as many "roadblocks" in the way as possible, from negotiation to inspections to repairs to closing to even providing all of the keys for the property.   While legally his role is to represent the seller, he provided no assistance to the buyer or the buyer's agent -- seemingly just to prove he didn't have to.  I wonder if Mr. Hammond realizes what kind of impression his "do nothing, care less" attitude leaves on prospective future customers -- ESPECIALLY since he's a "highly touted, award winning realtor" with the sixth largest online realty company:  ZIP REALTY.
