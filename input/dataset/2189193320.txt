I had ordered flowers a day in advance to be delivered at a business as a birthday surprise. The flowers were "guaranteed delivery" before 4:30. After the recipient didn't mention receiving them I had to ruin the surprise and ask them. I had received an email saying they were out for delivery at 11 am. At 5 pm I emailed them and was told they had a new driver who screwed up the delivery ... I was offered a refund and next day delivery or a 50% refund and delivery that night to their residence. I took the 50% and the flowers were delivered to the residence around 7 pm - but not after totally ruining the surprise/missing most of the day anyway. They responded quickly with a solution and the customer service was solid, but I wouldn't use them again or recommend them. It's not about the refund - it's about someone's special day being ruined over incompetence. The flowers were dull and nothing in comparison to what was pictured on their website. Even the vase was dull. For 100$ and guaranteed delivery I expect way more. I could have gotten the same quality flowers at a grocery store for $20.This was just a regular old Wednesday. I can't imagine the amount of ppl who use this company on Mother's Day and Valentine's Day to never have their loved ones receive their flowers. The one star given was for the solid customer service, which was nice - but the product itself wasn't the best quality and the delivery was unreliable. ***in my photos I added the bouquet that was shown on their website vs. The one that was actually delivered ***
