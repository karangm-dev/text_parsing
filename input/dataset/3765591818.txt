Worst experience they charged me a whole day amount rather than the overnight discount even when i opened the car 14 minutes early which is allowed to do so then randomly suspending my membership and leaving me without any clue that why this has been done with me i used to love this car sharing service but after this experience i just HATE it. I can say Zipcar is the slowest and most baddest in customer response and have the slowest response time.
