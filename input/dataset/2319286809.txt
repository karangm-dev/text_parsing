I have no idea why the place has received so many bad reviews, but I've been a loyal customer for this location for almost 3 years, and they consistently provide high quality deep fried chicken -- well-seasoned, crispy, tender, juicy, and, most importantly, not greasy!I would definitely say that this location is probably the best Popeyes in the downtown area.
