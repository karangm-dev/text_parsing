We went there on New Year's Eve. Food was terrible. I got prime rib medium. It was like shoe leather. My family's meals were bad as well. Very expensive and NOT worth it. Marriott should be ashamed of itself for having such a restaurant in its upscale resort. Look at many other reviews that rate it at a 1 or 2. Buyer beware!
