It seems every time I come here the service is very mediocre! Is it me or do the white chicks act like they own the place?? I swear they don't smile nor they really care about their job. Maybe it's just me. But I've come get used to the exemplary service I get at the Starbucks at Bramalea City Centre. The drinks are always done right and they don't give snarky remarks when they don't understand a drink order.
