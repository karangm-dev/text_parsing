Out of the blue, yesterday I get a USPS letter from "OnTrac" of Phoenix.  This letter informs me that my "Signature on File record with OnTrac" has expired and drivers can no longer leave packages at my door without my signature.I've never heard of this company.  Reading the reviews below, evidently Amazon uses them for delivery, and I have bought items at Amazon.  Did they deliver a package at some time in the past?  I don't know.  Did I ever previously authorize them to keep my signature on record?  NO.  Do I want them to have my signature on file?  Absolutely not.Amazon choses them to deliver, Amazon is responsible for their actions - such as providing them my name, address, etc.  Perhaps a good reason to avoid Amazon as well?Not even a SASE in the OnTrac mailing - I'm supposed to send them their info at my expense.Not gonna do that.
