Two bad haircuts in a row. I am done with Great Clips. Bad haircut in September, Took three months to grow it back out. Went in with a picture of exactly want I wanted. Ignored. Cut it back above my ears again. I asked why and was told it looked better. I wanted what I wanted, not what somebody else wanted. Don't go to Great Clips unless you are happy with the one haircut they know how to do. Me? I am done!
