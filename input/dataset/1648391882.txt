I was very disappointed.  Waitress was pleasant but slow.  We went for breakfast late on a Saturday morning.  The place wasn't busy.  One simple way to rate a restaurant?  Does your coffee cup every stay empty.  Mine did.  I didn't get a refill until I flagged her down.  My group had 4 people - 2 adults and 2 kids - including a 7 year old.  Our breakfast was $47!!  Two of us ordered the "budget" breakfast which was $5.99 each.  I am pretty sure we were overcharged.  The food was not that fantastic either.  Eggs over medium were cooked properly but the wheat toast was stale and cold.  The sausage was also cold.  I don't think we will be going back.  For $47, I could go to the grocery and cook up one heck of a breakfast for a crowd!
