Awesome server, and bartender, Raleigh . I work in the industry and came between lunch and dinner . We had a table in the tavern area . She was great- I'm difficult to wait on. I lived in Manhattan, for years,  and when I'm spending  a few hundred for two people to eat, I have  expectations . Raleigh never acted inconvenienced by my requests.. and I can't have much sugar and am very particular, and she happily tailored my drinks. I literally deconstructed the drink menu.. And she was awesome about it. AMAZING FOOD, even more AMAZING SERVICE!
