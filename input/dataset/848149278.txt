We had a delicious and authentic meal at Escobar's.  The guacamole was excellent as well as my carnitas dinner.  And the selection of 3 salsas were the best.  Such unique flavors.  The chef visited each table to ask if we enjoyed the food which was a nice welcoming touch.  Our waiter, Keith, was so funny and gave us great service.  Definitely recommend Escobar's.
