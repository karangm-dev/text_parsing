Amazing food. Glorious bevs. What more could you want? For a little celebration my boo thang & I decided to finally try this place. We called day of (Thursday) and couldn't make a reservation so we stopped in and were lucky enough to snag a seat at the bar (which is a little tight but I have short legs so it's cool)If it's your first time I actually recommend sitting here because as a tapas place they try to have you order your food all at once if you are at a table, sitting at the bar is less hurried & gives you chance to order a plate or 2 & decide if you want more.The staff was super knowledgeable & we especially loved the octopus, cabbage, Jamon iberico de bellota ("worlds best ham"). It's pricey but super worth it. Now Go! GO NOW!! See for yourself!
