If it wasn't for Skyla I'm not sure I ever would have gotten married. I was engaged for almost two years when Skyla reached out to me and wanted to meet up with me and my future husband to discuss her services as a wedding planner. I had tried multiple times to organize my own wedding, free of wedding planner charges, but found myself always too overwhelmed and often giving up. I didn't want my special day to be more stress than enjoyment. Skyla was able to hold my hand through the entire process, which took a load of stress off of my shoulders and allowed me to enjoyed planning for once AND her price was very reasonable. Totally worth it! Our budget was one that, I am sure was difficult to work with, but Skyla never complained and was able to create a miracle wedding atmosphere with our very small budget. It was everything we wanted. She was dedicated to give me the best. She even went out of her way to make my center pieces! (Which looked AMAZING) I had full faith in Skyla and let her choose my table, linens, chairs, and china. So glad I did, because it was absolutely stunning. Thank you so much Skyla and Skyla Booke Weddings and Events for helping me coordinate a fairy tale wedding.
