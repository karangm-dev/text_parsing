I really do despise Walmart and my most recent trip solidified my thoughts.  The place is an absolute mess, dim lighting, shady employees, and whats up with the tiny parking lot?  Only reason why I went there recently was 1) my family was in town and needed cheap work pants, 2) I uploaded pics of my new baby to the 1 hr photo, and 3) Walmart has a lot of preemie clothes for cheap.  I left disappointed as usual and I think a bit depressed....lol.   I guess if money is tight, Wally world is a godsend, but its just not for me.
