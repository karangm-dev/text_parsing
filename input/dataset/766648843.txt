My husband and I stopped here to eat. He ordered a steak and I ordered Mahi Mahi Tacos. My husbands steak had no flavor to it whatsoever. It tasted like they only cooked the meat and it wasn't fresh. The Tacos were the same. The meat was fried and tasted very dull, had no flavor to it. Worst place to eat on our whole 4 day trip by far. I'm sure what keeps their doors open are their drinks, unfortunately we wouldn't know since we had drinks while walking the strip.
