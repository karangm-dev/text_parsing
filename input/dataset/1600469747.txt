I've visited here with friends about 3 times now. Once for karaoke. All three times have been great. I'd heard of the Legion through my Military friends, but since my hubby and I are always on the go and finding new hip places to go with different activities, this just never came up. Even though it's literally on our very own backyard. The drink specials alone are enough to keep us here every weekend. There is however, a membership fee for Military, but it is very very minimal. Both my friend and my hubby are Veterans so it worked out great. The bar tenders are friendly and not afraid to try something new if they have the ingredients to make it. I literally showed them a recipe for a drink that he wanted and they looked it over a couple of times and had it ready within minutes. We will certainly go back. Not just the prices, but the comradeship of the Veterans sure makes everyone feel welcomed.
