I have been coming here for years and it is always horrible customer service (i swear it gets worse every time). Last time some little punk kid with plugs yelled at me for being 5 minutes late for my reservation even though i called ahead of time to let them know.  However.. you end up just allowing it because the price is awesome and so is the sushi. The wait staff is horrible.  They are horrible when you order drinks they are rude when they drop off your check... but ... I'm still coming back for the cheap sushi that so far hasn't made me violently sick.
