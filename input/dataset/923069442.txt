I don't understand why people are giving this place 4+ stars, the tacos r small and unappetizing. Obviously these people haven't ventured out into toronto to taste better or even decent tasting tacos... but these tacos here that they "specialize" in are definitely  not worth the hype or money. Portions r TINY, no sauces, no veggies, just a dragged clump of shredded meat and chopped green onions on top to garnish. The fish taco is the only appetizing thing on their menu even then the fish taco isn't that great.
