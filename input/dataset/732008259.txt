Disappointed many times over! Hesitate before hiring to build your pool. I would NOT use them or recommend desert Springs pools.The following occurred: higher than industry standard landscaping bid (I declined the bid),scupper pots that leak all over the pool deck that they are unable to figure out, and a vacuum that sits in one spot most of the day in the pool. The vacuum issue has improved street multiple experimental attempts (and head scratching).  They were very behind in completing the pool and this does not seem to bother them, it's business as usual. The pool designer was good, the supervisor, Joe, is hard working and amicable. My family enjoys the pool and spa, it's eye pleasing; very disappointed in the business model and dynamics of standing behind the product. As issues are addressed I will update this review to reflect good customer service. The plaster company reached out to fix an issue I was unhappy with (a crack)
