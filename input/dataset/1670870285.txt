Customer service sucks takes 4 people to ring up a shirt .Evelyn the sales person deserves a medal for being put in a situation like this. Eileen the manager in the photo didn't have a clue. Here's an idea just take $5 off the total as a discount instead of having me stand there for 20 minutes AND you lost sales as people walked away. I was just at a meeting in Vegas for ebay where the head of customer service talked about pleasing your buyers. There is a reason brick and mortar are going away and it's managers like this. Evelyn you are never too young  or old to learn to sell on eBay!!Spoke to Dana the manager before leaving she was very gracious hopefully they can fix this
