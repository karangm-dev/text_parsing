Yeah, meh. MEH! The steaks are par for this course! Outback, Black Angus quality. Sides are ok as well. The rolls however shine! Shine on you crazy rolls, shine on!!! They are sooooo good. You can watch them make them while you wait for your table! And wait you will!!! Even if you call ahead you will wait!!! The other plus is you can throw your peanut shells on the floor. . . just like a regular saw-dust on the floor whore house! The reason this place gets the 2 stars and not 3 or the elusive 3.5 is the salad! Twice, that's right I said it, TWICE now I've gotten a salad with bad lettuce. Gross lettuce. Lettuce past the prime of it's life! Not knowing or caring that the best days are behind him now. Just clinging to the chance to be someone's salad. What I'm trying to say is that the lettuce on my salad was bad. Both times the server said "We've been getting bad lettuce lately." It must happen often because they have a whole little spiel about it. 2nd time I asked for the manager and some 'ol boy named Garrett (He looked like a Garrett too!) saddled up and gave me the Manager's Special of the same story I just heard!!!!People. . . How hard is it to find good lettuce?!?!?
