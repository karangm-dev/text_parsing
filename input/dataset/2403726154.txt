I have seen the Jeff Civillico Comedy in Action Show twice and loved it both times.  Jeff is world class juggler.  He'll juggle just about anything from ping pong balls to bowling balls, knives, and things that are on fire.  He also invents odd tricks that change from show to show, and he completely engages the audience.  In fact, if you sit in front, there is a good chance that you will end up on stage as part of his act.  Little kids have an especially good time on stage.  The show takes place in the afternoon, so it's meant for families and people who want to skip sexually suggestive shows.  The theater is a little bit tough to find since The Quad is under renovation, but it's totally worth the extra effort.
