Wow!  I have been holding back for like 6 months from getting eyebrows threaded bcs I've had bad experiences. Just moved here and decided to go with Farida based on great reviews here on yelp.  Must say she is BY FAR the best I've ever been to!!!  Both eyebrows match!!! I told her a little as to how I like them but let her do her thing. She took her time.  Was so impressed when she showed me! Happy client!!  All the ladies there seemed so nice! Very warm and welcoming!!  Don't go anywhere else!
