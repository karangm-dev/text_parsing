Great service, great dishes. Tried the Khua Kling (Dry Curry) with beef as the meat and it's the most flavorful and SPICY dish I've ever had. Prepare to drink 8 glasses of water and a bowl of comped cucumbers (it's that hot). Will definitely be back and have my family check out that dish specifically.
