I'm shocked at all the bad reviews. I love Dr. Monroe's staff! I see Ana, the PA and she is very kind and understanding of all of my questions. They are all super supportive and I've never had to wait more than 30 minutes for my appointment. If you're going to a doctor and you get in right at your appointment time, you must be living in a dream land because doctors are always running behind. The only issue I have with them is that they don't answer the phone right when they open and they always seem to close early, making it hard to catch them if you have a busy day. Dr. Monroe and staff have helped me lose 20 lbs in one month because of her thorough testing and putting me on an intense treatment plan sans medication! I will recommend her to everyone and anyone!
