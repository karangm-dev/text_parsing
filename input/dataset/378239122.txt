I expected the food to taste better. I got a $5 coupon for the buffet at a smaller much cheaper hotel in Vegas and didn't go in expecting much but it was decent, The Buffet at Bellagio was not much better than the $5 buffet but cost $25. The pre made eggs looked so bad I didn't dare, the bacon looked microwaved, the pastries were hard, and there were not enough breakfast choices. Half the buffet were lunch choices at 8am. I would have given it one star but I like the location.
