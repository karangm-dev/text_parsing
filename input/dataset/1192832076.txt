One of the grossest food court items I've ever got anywhere. Even my husband wouldn't eat it, and he doesn't refuse food often.Service was good. But our Beef and Broccoli  and Orange Chicken was like eating balls of deep fried paste dipped in the most bland sauce you can find. I tried to force it down because I hadn't eaten in a while but it was impossible. $10  2 item combo in the garbage. Even the egg roll got tossed after a bite from both of us.
