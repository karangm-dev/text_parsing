He did my entire house n left lines. I could see where the carpets meet.  I kinda dealt with it cuz im on a time crunch.  I asked him for more work.  We agreed the next day n i text him if hes gonna come n he replied yes.  I texted him later cuz it was getting late n he text hes almost on his way.   2 hours later he was a no show nor did he text that he couldn't make it or reschedule.  Im on a time crunch.  Not acceptable.
