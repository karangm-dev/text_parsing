Yelp did not steer us wrong when it sent us to Pullman.  Understated on the outside, very chic but comfortable on the inside.  I was surprised when they asked us if we had a reservation at 11pm, but the host quickly found us a spot.  I liked the feel of the downstairs bar itself, it was kind of U shaped, putting us facing and next to other patrons, with the bar tender making the magic in between.  The wine selection was great, and the server very helpful in helping me select which particular varietal I wanted.  I love wine bars that can pull off great wine with knowledgeable servers minus the pretention.  The crowd wasn't rowdy, but they definitely weren't reverently enjoying their Saturday night.  Next time I'm in Montreal, I'll be sure to go back here and get the food.
