ZERO stars. Poor customer service.  I dined there with two friends after a concert at the MGM.  We were not greeted by Cameron the hostess, instead she spoke to us with her back turned to us.  They brought out the wrong order and had a poor attitude about changing the order.  I order the traditional wings mild with curly fries , they brought me dipping fries instead of curly . Mercedes, the server was inattentive; paying all her attention to the table with men. The restaurant was slow while we were there from 11:30-1:30.  We split our orders and  paid our $47 bill with a $100 bill and a $20.  She brought back less than $20 change. She claimed that she thought we handed her $50. Please be aware that MERCEDES ALMOST STOLE $50. We had to call the manager  Jeremy Manta over to resolve the issue.  He issued us a credit for the amount of money we spent on the back of a business card which was 6 wings per person and 25% off. He was extremely condescending. Will not be dining there again.  If you are a group of women, please be warned that you may not be received and served adequately.
