Had an awesome first time at AZ Top Golf. Big shoutout to Kat our server and Michelle her manager, who kept us very happy with food and drink while a swarm of different events were going on from Make a Wish In-progress to World Series Game 1. We had a minor glitch w one appetizer, but they did everything to make it right and then some! You can definitely trust the staff to take care of you. Would absolutely come back, and makes me wish Top Golf would come to the SF Bay Area!
