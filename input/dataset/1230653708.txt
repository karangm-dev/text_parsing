This man has truly changed my life in so many ways!!!  I have suffered from back and neck pain for years and have endured several surgeries, only to have the pain return.  Dr. Albert has set me free from the constant pain and need for pain medication.  I am a totally different person thanks to his amazing technique.At first, I was skeptical as he is not like the traditional - snap, crackle and pop chiropractors.  I felt like with them I was constantly having to go several times a week for months on end; which was difficult and the pain always returned.  In the beginning with Dr. Albert I went a couple times a week and instantly felt amazing.  He explained it would take my body some time to get used to the technique and after a couple of weeks I was pain free.  I now only need to see him maybe once a month to keep things in shape and am amazed at how differently I feel.  I would highly recommend this highly gifted to man to everyone!!!
