I have passed this pace so many times. I was never in the mood to go to a "hot dog" place, and so I passed it by. Just think of all of those wasted opportunities. This place serves hot dogs in a way that is gourmet and satisfying. I had to try two of these amazing dogs on my first trip. I opted for the coney island dog and the dog of the day - I think it was called the urban cowboy". Both of these were full of flavor. The hot dogs had a nice snap, and the buns were grilled to perfection. I opted for the fries, but I cannot wait to go back and try their "famous" onion rings in the near future. Don't waste an opportunity and pass this place like I did so many times. You will find the food unique, flavorful, and fun!
