Waited 20 minutes for a server to come over and give us water. The server finally came over after we asked 2 people for our server. After that she took our order on a newspaper that she grabbed off a stand because she didnt have her pad. She took out orders and the wrong food came out. Food was bland with little flavor. I do not recomment this place.
