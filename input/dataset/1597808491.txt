My friend ask me "Where you you wanna eat?". My reply "Anywhere with a happy hour and GOOD food". She took me here. Our server was amazing, (her named started with a J) everything she recommended, I was sold on.  My food was savory and I was SPEECHLESS, THE beverage program was AMAZING, I let my server pick my entr√©e and WOW I was impressed. I had the chicken curry soup (WOW. I know curry and that, I wanted the recipe), next my meal with sweet potato fries and a svory panini (her choice), I was speechless. I ATE THE WHOLE THING. I HAD AMAZING SERVICE I HAD GREAT FOOD I HAD GREAT DRINKS AND BEER ( FOR A REASONABLE PRICE) YOU HAD ME AT PERFECT.I'll be back tho. Thanks. I'm a server and I couldn't complain about a thing.
