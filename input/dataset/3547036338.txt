I had some shorts taken in with Annie and had to go back, because they weren't taken in enough... she argued with me for several minutes about how they were fine, but I insisted she take them in more. She told me they would be two weeks, so I waited. When I finally picked them up she was as smug as can be (in front of another customer, mind you). She actually took the shorts in just enough to make them uncomfortable and basically unwearable. I'm pretty sure she did it on purpose. I haven't been back since.
