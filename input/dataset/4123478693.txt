Zero stars!!!!! So here we are again. I said I would never come to this location and unfortunately I had to because it was the most convenient. I find myself in complete disappointment on how rude the employees could be here. There is about 20 of us standing out in the hall just before 7. When 7 hit a man comes and barley opens the door to grab the sign in clipboard and shuts it. I don't understand how he could not open the door and hold it for us or atleast prop it open or hell even say good morning you may now come in and have a seat and walk in. But not one word came our his mouth. I am saddened at what this world has become.
