Moved to the area recently and needed to transfer my house into a trust deed. Had tried  to make contact with a few recommended attorneys but never got a call back. It was a simple task, and I found it quite humorous that I could not get a call back. I called Nicole's office and was able to get to her directly. Told her my needs and she was on it! Very professional and bright person. She expedited the matter efficiently and expertly. Although my estate trust matters have already been set up, I would never hesitate to use her or recommend her for anything. I appreciate it when an attorney can pay the needed attention in a timely manner. I find that rare.
