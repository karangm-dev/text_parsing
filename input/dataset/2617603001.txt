Honestly, the worst beer event I've ever been to. The first one was rained out, but the management told us they were going to provide beer the whole time. They also stopped us from gong to vendors when the rain stopped. Before the rain came vendors that were promised were not actually there(Avery brewing)  Fast forward six weeks. They've rescheduled this event outside again. There's honestly only four Vendors now and they have punch cards counting the worst beers you've ever had.
