This isn't the place to take your girl on a romantic first date, but if you've been together a few years and your SO is dying to see some specific movie that came out 2 months ago- I'll give you the thumbs up.This would be a solid 4-star establishment, except for the following..CONS:Too many young children allowed to talk through the film.(Really, why are you bringing your infant and toddler to Bad Grandpa, anyway?)Prices are constantly increasing, which means value is decreasing.($2 per ticket, it was $5.50 for a small popcorn, $5.00 for a large soda- prices are on par or more expensive than traditional theaters)Establishment isn't maintained well; restrooms, seating and flooring all could use a little work.I can overlook that this place isn't located in the greatest part of town, I can overlook that the bathrooms are a little dirty, I can overlook that people bring their kids- the cheap tickets have become less of a value.
