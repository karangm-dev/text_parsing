i came here because i have been having severe leg cramps for several days.  I did some research online about that and the advice is to stretch, drink lots of water, etc.  If all else fails try a muscle relaxer.So still with leg cramps.. severe.. i came in and saw the dr.. which isnt free... and she says drink water im not giving you muscle relaxers.   No kidding dr.. i got that from google search too.  What a rip off.  If you want urgent relief do not go here!
