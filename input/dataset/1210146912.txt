DON'T GO HERE IF YOU WANT TO PASS A SMOG CHECK!! Went here on 8/8 and was extremely frustrated with the two young men who did my smog check. First off, they looked confused when they looked under the hood of my Ford F-250. Then they didn't put the sensor into my tailpipe, even though I told them that they had to because my vehicle is considered "heavy duty". He refused to listen to me. Maybe it's because I'm a woman. He told me that it failed because it's a 2001 with only 63,000 miles on it. No, it failed because he didn't know what he was doing! He also "failed" the 3 vehicles in front of me! Don't go here if you want your car to pass its smog check!
