I just happened to learn of this store from a Foot Locker employee who informed they have good NFL merchandise. I was looking for a Raiders item for a gift and the friendly gal assisted me with finding what I needed.The Staff is super friendly and inviting! This store is tucked away in the corner, so you may easily miss it unless you know about it.I know where I will be buying all of my NFL sports team memorabilia at from now on. This store is Super cool and I dig it!
