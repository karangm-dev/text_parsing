I am writing this based on my opinion before the illness outbreak at this location. I ate there once awhile back and liked the food. Line was ridiculously long, staff not all that friendly, but food was good. Thus I wanted to return. I brought my husband there about a month ago and it was gross. We got beef items and every bite had gristle and fat. I was so grossed out. On top of that line was still slow and staff was very unfriendly. It's like they were just part of a machine and not responding to you like people. They weren't really listening either. It was strange. Place was pretty messy too. I will not go back, especially not to this location, especially now. I still can imagine the feeling of that fatty meat. Ew!
