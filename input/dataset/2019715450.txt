I love sushi kui AYCE!  On Tuesday nights I believe it is 10% off and it's worth it even at full price.  We usually sit in the back room and it's always a full house.  This place has really good spicy salmon rolls and tempura rolls.  The sushi is fresh and it never smells funny here at all.  They have specialty rolls too like green dragon and red dragon included in the AYCE.  They also have a variety of pizzas - we always order the crab pizza.  It's good because the crab is shredded on top, not just sticks of crab.
