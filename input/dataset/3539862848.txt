It's not you they're happy to see, it's your money. Made a reservation for 8pm. We eventually got seated with only a drink and dessert menu. Then, we were forgotten about. Finally, one of the waitresses (very kind and was the highlight of our "stay") said she didn't know if anyone had offered us drinks. The answer to that was "no", though it was kind of her to notice we'd been ignored. At last, a woman who was apparently the manager started pushing the specials. Me, only given a drink and dessert menu, asked if we could order dessert. She told us if we wanted dessert we could order an entree or leave. I understand if you prioritize getting money from people over customer satisfaction, however, she was extremely rude and then disappeared. Not a single smile or ounce of genuine attention from anyone other than the girl who offered us drinks. After waiting longer, another waitress finally appeared asking if we decided to stay for food. I informed her no one gave us a food menu. At this point, I'd already gotten a very bad taste of this place regarding the service. I certainly did not feel as if my presence was wanted - the most important thing was the money in my pockets. We were given a food menu, the waitress apologized, but the menu did not appear appetizing (though I admit to being biased as I did not want to give this establishment my money any longer). We ended up at another spot down the street. It was a bitter experience in an otherwise very sweet day (at three other fantastic restaurants in the area). P.S. they had fish here and the poor things kept coming to the surface for air. This is a sign of an oxygen problem in that tank as this behaviour shows distress. No stones, no decoration, it was just an empty tank.
