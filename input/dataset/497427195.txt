I never write reviews but I had to for these guys. They do things a little bit differently here compared to most places. As soon as we walked in the cashier introduced himself shook my hand, looked me in the eye, and asked for my wife and I's name.  He welcomed us then took our order. We ordered a large Sicilian pizza and some garlic knots. Tony said first time customers ALWAYS get something free so he gave us the garlic knots on the house!When we got our pizza we were a little disappointed just because it was the wrong type of pizza. I asked if this was the right one and it seems like there was a mix up on the order (not surprised, they were super busy on a friday night)Tony came out and immediately apologized asked if we wanted to change it out. Since i hate being that customer, I told him now worries. Despite that Tony said he wanted us to still try it and was going to give us some slices for FREE. And I am so glad he did the sicilian pizza was amazing! Super fluffy, cheesy, saucy goodness. And the slices were huge!Tony knows the value of customers and how to treat them right. I told tony we will be coming back (especially for the Sicilian) Key takeaways:Owner or Manager Tony is the man! He knows business and how to satisfy a customer.
