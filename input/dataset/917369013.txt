We went purely for the experience and I was very disappointed. If I want to see pretty gay men dancing and lip synching I will go to a drag show. The only difference between TFDU was these guys don't wear false eyelashes and the boobs (pecs) are real. It took Forevah to get one drink and the drunk bride to be in front of us falling on her ass  far more entertaining than anyone on stage. Also I do not take kindly to seeing women be objectified in such a rude manner. Placing a woman on her knees and shoving a g-strig covered d*ck in her face is just tacky. I can see a show being sexual but with no class.
