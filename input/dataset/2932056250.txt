Deal of a prix fixe lunch for $20. I was expecting less than great service with it being lunch & probably less staff, but service was very prompt & courteous. Get the lavraki- little sea bass was delicious. I also got the yogurt martini- a bit tart & refreshing Greek yogurt. My friend's pork chop was good, but she thought her walnut dessert was a little too sweet. The coffee was fine; in order for me to judge a restaurant as good, it must serve good coffee. I'd go back to check out dinner if I ever visit Vegas again.
