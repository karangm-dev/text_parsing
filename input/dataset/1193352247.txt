I have no idea why the service is consistently bad here. Until a Popeyes opens on Golden Mile Highway (which I would totally frequent), I have to rely on this out of the way location for my Southern fried chicken fix. The first time I had Popeyes, it was in an airport and the chicken was seasoned, crispy, light and superb. This location of Popeyes is extra greasy and heavy. The service though, is inexcusable. The workers here don't greet you, smile or respond well to any questions. I've been here twice and my orders were wrong both times. They missed my side last time and a biscuit this time. When you tell them to correct this, I was given major attitude and no correction. Also, can people working here go through training to entering coupons? It is not very difficult and absolutely does not take 10 minutes. My last complaint is about their iced tea. It's hard to mess up iced tea but their version is so heavily sugared and congested with syrup, I had to choke back a gag because of the artificial sweetness.
