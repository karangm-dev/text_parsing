We have visited many times, never had on complaint. Tonight has been a different story... I2 people in waiting room, and we were told at check in that it would be a long wait... 1 hour later, 2 kids left... then 20 minutes later we were finally called back! And told that they took so long cause they thought that we had left!!Wait to see doctor, nothing unusual there, wait for test results, 30 minutes...Get results, given care instructions by Dr, and almost 45 minutes later, still waiting for discharge paperwork...
