Will never go back.We gave this place a second chance yesterday, will not be going back.  The menu is limited to start with, they were out of any fish for the day.  The chicken Caesar salad didn't come with any chicken and was the worst paste-like dressing I have ever had.  My husband had the meat platter that was supposed to have venison and two types of sausages, after it was served we asked why there was no venison we were told they were out of that as well, but the server didn't know that when we ordered it...and apparently the kitchen didn't think to mention it after the order was placed.  $31 for sausage.
