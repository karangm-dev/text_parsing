I was referred here when I was living outside of Calgary about 15 years ago and THANK GOD. Dr. Storwick is highly regarded (since he's brilliant) and his clinic is amazing. The staff are incredibly helpful and friendly, although admittedly the phone recording can be a little annoying at first. You need a referral for dermatology but if you're considering laser hair removal GO HERE. Latest equipment and a highly trained nurse does it. Isn't that more reassuring than a recent high school graduate in a hair salon who took a course on the weekend and is now shooting lasers at your crotch?! Thought so.
