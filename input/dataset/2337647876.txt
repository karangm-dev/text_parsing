This was my first visit to Ncounter but it won't be my last "encounter" with the place.  The food was good, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was pleasant for such a busy place.  There was plenty of seating, too.  This will be a great place for those headed to a game to stop in for a bite to eat either on the way there or on their way back because the lightrail is right across the street.  I have also tried this owner's other restaurant, T.C. Eggington's in Mesa and really like it too.
