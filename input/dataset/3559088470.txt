The best service I've ever had, Denise was amazing. Very knowledgeable on menu items and gave great insight into the history of the restaurant and surrounding area, as well as just overall great conversation. The food was equally amazing, with the Michelin chef making incredible organic, from scratch dishes. Will go back every time I'm in Scottsdale.
