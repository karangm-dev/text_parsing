This place has the potential to be good but they just don't care!! We ordered the ranch steak pizza and it was incredibly dry and had  only a few tiny chipped pieces of steak on it so it was like eating dry French fries! The Caesar salad was definately not worth $8.99..  for 30$ plus tip, we will go somewhere else!
