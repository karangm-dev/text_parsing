The look of the place and the passion teas are amazing!! Fun to just sit there and chill with friends. But the last time I went I ordered a honey bread 35 minutes passed and I never got it, there was only one worker and many costumers but when I went up to ask about my bread she said she forgot so I waited another 15mins for it and let me tell you it's not even as great as everyone hypes it up to be!
