I love taco y taco! Not just because of their salsa bar, but also because everything is always fresh and authentic! I can't find another taco spot here that can compete. We are from LA so this is HUGE! My husband always get the carne Asada Gran Taco, chicken regular tacos and their elote. I LOVE their Hongos (mushroom) seta style (where they melt the cheese on the tortilla).Don't sleep on the salsa bar.
