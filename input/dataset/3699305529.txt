This morning I once again found someone (upstairs neighbors) had spit on our car. Once I get proof I will call the police but this is really PISSING ME OFF. I know they need proof as to who is doing this but the management won't tell me what they would do when I do get the proof. I doubt it is a visitor who targeted our car 4 different times. We never park in the same spot so they go out of their way to spit on it no matter where it is parked. The first 2 times sadly, I did not take pictures. From now on I will and will send each picture to management. These disgusting people need to grow up. How would management feel if their car is being spit on constantly? Bet they wouldn't like it one bit! They are pushing me to call the police but their hands are tied until I do get the proof. It is too bad we have to involve the police before the management will do something. Even if I do get proof and get the police involved, I will not hold my breath that management will do anything but send a strongly worded email to stop the spitting. It is very sad that I have no faith in these people who are supposed to make living here "feel like home".
