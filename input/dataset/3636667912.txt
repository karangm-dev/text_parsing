My experience with this location is don't use the online app to place your order. Paid for a 12", got a 6". Had to drive back to the store. And gave me sriracha sauce instead of buffalo for my sale and it was horrible. Yesterday, I went into the shop so I could watch to make sure I get what I asked for and ordered the new chicken Caesar melt prepared as advertised. Did not like it at all and definitely not worth $8! I have been eating at Subway for years and the quality and customer service at this location lacks in both. Looking for another sandwich shop.
