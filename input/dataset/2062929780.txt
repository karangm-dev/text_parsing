Beware, the Gun Garage has changed ownership and it is upside down. The girls are gone and there are two kids running things. They are about 15 years old. It took me fifteen minutes to get checked into the range. There was no air conditioning in the building. I know this because the crack of my ass was dripping with sweat as well as my forehead. The kid on the cash register does not know how to use it. There was one person in front of me and I waited twenty three minutes to get checked out and pay. It was a very poor experience and I was very upset.
