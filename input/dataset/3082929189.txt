Pretty awesome place to grab some beers and just hang out.The patio was a great place to just chill with some friends.  Parking is enormous.  Bartenders friendly.  Prices reasonable.  Indoors has a nice ambiance to it and looks like a place that could be a staple if I lived nearby.Special shout-out to Tyber for sponsoring our kickball team--Drinkers with Kicking Problems!  Okay, you get your fifth star...bribery works.dmo out
