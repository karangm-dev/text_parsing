Really large portions and great food. Service is typical Asian which is largely distracted and inattentive. But most Asian restaurants are like that. So if you can just learn to jump out in front of servers and drag them to your table, you will be okay. There is an unbelievable din as well as everyone talks above a dull roar. Worth it for the food though if you are not looking for ambience.
