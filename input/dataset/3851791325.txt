Sunday evening 3-19-18. Party of 7. Must have been understaffed because the tables were not cleared and the servers were running. After 2 large trays of chips and several bowls of delicious chipotle salsa we still had no water!! I asked the bartender for a pitcher of water and some glasses and he refused. Good food. Terrible service. Thank you for your thoughtful and generous response! We did enjoy the food. It was delicious. We will revisit the restaurant soon.
