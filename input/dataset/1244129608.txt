I ordered a refill using their automated phone in option. The pharmacy at this location is severely lacking. I went in on Wednesday to pick up an Rx, they said they were having issues billing my secondary insurance, so after about 20 minutes I told them I would call my insurance and come back the next day. I called my insurance the next morning and was told there was nothing wrong on either of their ends- all authorizations had cleared on the expensive medication. Thursday, I went in to pick up the medicine, and they still had issues billing my insurance. 20 minutes later, they find out that they weren't able to bill my insurance correctly because they were trying to bill them for an incomplete prescription (they only had 7 pills rather than the 30 to fill the script). I was never told they didn't have enough medication to fill the script. They gave me the 7 pills they had previously filled for me along with an IOU for the rest of the medication and I paid my copay.. I can't imagine that it's company policy to handwrite an IOU on a receipt for $500 worth on medication.On a brighter note the staff was polite, although one of them seemed really annoyed at my persistence but I suppose I'd get a little frustrated too.
