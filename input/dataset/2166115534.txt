Awesome Southern comfort food, done with impeccable style and service.  I visited with my 3 sisters, and we all could not believe how good everything was!  The brined fried chicken with watermelon and waffle came with maple syrup and a hot red sauce--just the right blend of sweet and savory!  Grilled romaine --crispy and charred and perfect.  Florida heirloom tomatoes with citrus vinaigrette--perfect!  Desserts were a giant piece of bourbon layer cake with cream cheese bacon frosting (!) and chocolate chess pie.  It was worth the food coma!
