Second to none, and the sales force is knowledgeable and informative.The crew at Discount Tires is second to none. It was about 3:45, Saturday afternoon when I noticed, what I thought was a small leak in one of my tires. I brought my vehicle to Discount Tire to have the tire looked at before it went flat. Once I arrived at Discount Tires I noticed the place was packed and closed at 5:00 pm. I asked the sales associate if there was any possibility to have a tire checked for a leak, and he said, "absolutely". The sales associate took my information and advised that I was due for a tire rotation so they would take care of that as well. My tire was just low on air pressure, no leak, the tires were rotated, and I was back on the road by 4:30, at no charge. Discount Tire has consistently performed at a level seldom seen these days. The sales force is knowledgeable and can make solid suggestions if you give them sufficient information as to your needs. I am so glad I went to and will continue to go to Discount Tires.
