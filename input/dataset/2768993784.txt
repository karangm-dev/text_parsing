I had a change in my insurance at the beginning of the year and notifIed the office staff in December that Dr. Cunningham was not converted by my new plan.  The office called me in January to make a appointment and reminded them that my insurance didn't cover me to visit the office.  Again I asked them not to contact me again.  I received another call in February then a letter I March.  I called the office and spoke with the office manager who assured me the one wouldn't contact me again.  I informed her that if the office did contact me again I would gimme a complaint with the medical board.  Today I received a call from the office asking me to schedule an appointment with the doctor.  This is nothing more then harassment!  If you like getting harassing phone calls I recommend this medical office.
