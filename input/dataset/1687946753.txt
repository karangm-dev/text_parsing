When I was looking for a new groomer as my old one was moving out of town I was asking my groomer at the time who she would recommend and she mentioned Diane at Razzle Dazzle. I can start with saying I was a little hesitant about taking my "kids" to just anyone 1) Razzle Dazzle is out of my way about 10 miles and 2) she was new. I'm so glad I called Diane and after talking to her on the phone I felt confident that she was the one who would take over caring for my little ones.  I have been taking my "kids" to Razzle Dazzle now for a couple years. All I can is Diane is simply AMAZING!!!! Let's just say I would travel an additional 30 miles if it meant that Diane would still be caring for my "kids".
