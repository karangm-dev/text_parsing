Sat at bar, ordered $25 glass of Cakebread Chardonnay after waiting awhile to be acknowledged (my reasoning, you ask? wines by the glass selection very limited & low quality despite cost being $10+ and I figured - hey, I'm in Vegas I'll splurge). She delivered an empty wine glass, explained that her manager needed to deliver it and well...you can guess it...it never came. Guy next to me had ordered a beer when I first sat down, and was now ordering his next one. Then oddly, I watched as several of the staff and management came out to the bar area with flashlights looking under cabinets and other areas, assumedly searching for some lost something-rather, and so I figured this big mystery was trumping my glass of wine. I waited a few more minutes, attempted to flag someone down to no avail, and ended up leaving my empty glass at the bar. On broader review, the food menu was limited (just Lunch though it was 3pm and the lunch menu hours were not listed nor was there a Dinner menu). The Southern Caesar salad looked enticing despite I never knew that Winter Park, Florida was known for its Tomme cheese. Having lived there for some time I don't remember seeing cows, ewes, or goats milling about, but anyway - good luck to the place. I'll try it again if I'm ever here again though my expectations are low.
