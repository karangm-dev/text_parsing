We have been coming here for almost 2 years. I loved them at first. Coming to get routine vaccines were easy. The original doctor we saw was great but I'm not sure she is there anymore. Now that our dog has gotten a little older we're experiencing common issues such as tear stains and matted hair. This is our first dog so we're not very educated on certain things. We took him in because we found a lump on his ear and come to find out he just needed to be brushed. They charged us $40 to brush him! When we brought him in a couple months ago for tear stains (another $40 just for the visit) we were told that it wasn't an infection or allergies and that we needed to purchase Angel Eyes and Probiotic and special face wipes. We spent $100 to get these items. 2 months later we're back here with the same tear stains and a different doctor said it was clogged ducts and would take him back to flush it out for $20. 15 minutes later we get the bill and it's $30 because she had to use "special tools". At this point we are frustrated with how they nickel and dime you and will be going elsewhere (after almost 2 years!!) we went in to request for records because we will take our business elsewhere, they couldn't care less. I'm not one of those angry customers who love to post negative reviews. In fact I am business owner myself, I understand that negative reviews can be exaggerated but this is no exaggeration, I hope your office would consider integrity over greed.
