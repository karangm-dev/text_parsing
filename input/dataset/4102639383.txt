We are getting our rental house ready to put on the market, and reached out to Nunez Painting to repaint our fence and do some drywall repairs on our patio ceiling. They were prompt and courteous, and even finished the work a day earlier than expected. They did an AWESOME job - I will definitely be calling them for my next paint job!
