The steaks are AMAZING (duh). I had the teriyaki sirloin and it was one of the best steaks I've ever had. When people say size doesn't matter what they're really talking about are the steaks at the Keg. Although the portions are a bit smaller than other places, its surprisingly filling and did I mention delicious? I had the twice-baked potato on the side and I have to say it was bomb.Decor is awesome and staff are extremely helpful, definitely a good place for date night.
