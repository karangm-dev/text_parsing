While I love the idea of getting a fresh salad and a fresh loaf of sourdough all in a drive-thru, I am not excited about the last and only 2 experienced I've had. I ordered a turkey bacon avocado salad, and TWICE I brought it home and there was no bacon! Not a big deal, I know, but if it happens to me twice,  it's an issue. I wouldve loved to resolve it by calling the restaurant to let them know their bacon was missing!  But I called 4 times, and it rang and rang for minutes, at 4pm!  All I can say is, don't deprive a woman of her bacon!
