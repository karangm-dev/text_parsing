I love LOVE.  If you're a Beatles fan, you will adore this show.  Not as Cirque as some of the other shows, but good dancing, acrobatics, and coordination.  And the music is an interesting mix.  The theater is small so even cheap seats (which we had, in the back back back row) were great.  Go, spend what you can for seating, relax, and enjoy the show.Also, check for tickets on your m-life account for discounts and/or stop by the tix4tonight booth as they had some when I was in town.
