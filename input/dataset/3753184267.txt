Do you like sleek lines, good construction and long lasting fabrics?  Do you love designer clothing but don't have the budget?  Well then look no further, Calgary's best kept secret Vespucci on Elbow Drive gives you 8000 square feet of what you are craving.  I didn't believe it myself until my mother's friend told me to go there.  Upon entering I couldn't believe my eyes, first of all the architecture of the building is 1970s and so is the furniture and the interior decor, so it gives it a nice circa feel.  The employees are dressed quite chic, like something out of a 1970s Vogue, or more like Jacqueline Kennedy look a likes.Vespucci has been around for 20 years and carries all designer labels, Prada, Gucci, Coach just to name a few, and it not only carries clothing but also jewellery, shoes, handbags and evening gowns.The beauty about this store is that is color coded you pick up a blue dress and you look above and there are matching handbags, below matching shoes.  It's shopaholicly dreamy.Vespucci also exists in Edmonton and will soon have an online antique website that you can shop on out of High River.
