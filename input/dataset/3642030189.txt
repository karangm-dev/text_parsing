I recently took my laptop in for a dignostic which was overpriced and I ended up buying a reconditioned netbook. I got an Aspire One for $299. Turns out its really slow and OVER PRICED! I got home and looked it up online and it's  only $289 at Walmart BRAND NEW. Come on people it doesnt take a genius to figure it out. Brand new is cheaper than used. Ridiculous right. I was gonna return it and get my money back but Im pretty much stuck because when I checked my receipt, it says there's a restoking fee of 25%. That's $75+ of a lost!!!! I feel ripped off and will not be returning to that store anytime soon. Another unhappy customer for Laptop Xchange.
