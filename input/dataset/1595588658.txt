I stopped in here today with a good friend of mine simply looking for one single beautiful flower that matched my dress to tuck behind my ear. We were so graciously greeted by The shop owner Sarah! She is a wonderful Italian woman and was so lovely and kind to us. Her shop is equipped with a large freezer full of fresh beautiful flowers and she was extremely helpful even though we needed just one little flower!! It was a great experience. We love Sarah!!!
