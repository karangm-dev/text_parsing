I went back for lunch.  This time around, the service was faster.  While the food was decent,  the owner failed to mention that for one of the items I ordered on the combo, there would be an extra charge.  It was not explained very clearly on the menu. I was not happy that my combo plate, which I thought would cost me under 8 dollars ended up being 12 or 13 dollars.  Oh well.
