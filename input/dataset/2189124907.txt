Well if your really into the whole super hero avengers this is the place for you $34 per person kids under 3 get in free so unless your really into it go for it other wise save your money it's pretty much just a tour with the hero captain America hulk suits behind glass wire not much of interaction or hands on just walking around pictures they have costumes you can wear they try make sale get that little extra cash from you 5 pictures for $37 or 1 for $20 save your money just take pictures inside brought my son he was sooo excited but ended up being very disappointed more for under kids
