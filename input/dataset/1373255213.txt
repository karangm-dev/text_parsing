Pizza is ok, just regular old delivery pizza. However, I tried the pesto chicken pasta and it was NOT good. The chicken was dry and tasteless, the sauce was green and pesto looking, but tasted nothing like pesto, and the noodles on all sides of the container were burned. Don't waste money on their pesto chicken pasta.
