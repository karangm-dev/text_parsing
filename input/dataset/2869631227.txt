.Shopping at Cross Iron Mills works up an appetite and what can you do when you need to waste sometime before a movie and want a beer? Go to a pub, that's what!We walked on in and sat on the lounge side (apparently children are allowed on the other) Overall I thought that our waitress was friendly and service was good - however there were a couple short comings....I was delivered the incorrect beer - no big deal really, our waitress was good about it and took the other one away and got me the one I wanted. The second thing that bothered me was we got 2 starters and 2 mains all at once... where is the timing/spacing? I mean, our table was a bit small to begin.We ordered the shrimp cake sliders which were small but pretty tasty, the ale & cheddar dip (which I found very heavy and did not like the flavour) was delivered to us warm not hot and was already separating... For mains, the better half got the stacked reuben and I ordered the beet salad, these were both pretty tasty but what you would expect for pub food.Would I go back? Eh. One generic pub is usually like another, but If I want a beer and find myself at Cross Iron again... chances are high due to slim choices.
