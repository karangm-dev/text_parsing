One of my favourite spots in the neighbourhood.The owners, Christian and Amelia, are not only super nice, but are also tapped into the community and make huge effort to participate in the neighbourhood. The food is consistently great - they make a lot of things from scratch, which I appreciate so much. Coffee is also great. The service isn't the fastest, but it's not a 'grab breakfast to go' kind of place for us. We really love sitting in the cozy atmosphere and having a lazy breakfast.Our favourites include: tailpipe smoothie, breakfast sandwich, southern fried tofu sandwich, and biscuit sandwich.
