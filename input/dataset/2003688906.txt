overpriced over-the-counter candy.  also, my daughter saw the hello kitty pre-packaged candy (she's 2 years old) and started fiddling with the containers. not banging around, not throwing.  she would take them out of the box then put them back in.  yes, it's probably mildly annoying. but she's 2, and it IS a candy store. employee came and reprimanded her.
