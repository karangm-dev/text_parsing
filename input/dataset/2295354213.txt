Terrible place- ordered iced green tea and tried to order one of the juice/smoothies options. They are out of my first 3 choices, finally order something that supposedly they are not out of- guess what, 2 minutes later they are out of it as well. At this point I just want to walk away but my bf really wants something so he decides on latte. We step aside and wait- 5 minutes later we hear- what was your order? Tea? Black or green? My iced tea arrives lukewarm and my coffee loving bf decides to throw the latte away as it is disgusting. In their defense- it was almost closing time but this whole situation could have been handled so much better.
