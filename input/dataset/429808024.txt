I've eaten here once and probably won't be back. I ordered a beef enchilada, chicken taco, which came with a side of beans and rice and chips and salsa. The taco was meh, the chips were stale, salsa was bland and enchilada red sauce tasted like ketchup. Where is the heat, where is the spice? Prices were kind of high for what you get. Really disappointed by the lack of good Mexican food in the area, all the places I've been to are either very bland or too Americanized, and the slightly more authentic ones are the greasy fast food type places. Do yourself a favor and drive over to Phoenix for better options.  Maybe I just have to drive a little further south for the really good stuff!
