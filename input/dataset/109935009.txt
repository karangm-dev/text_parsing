Friendly staff, large beer selection, REALLY good food.  Started with the mozzarella cheese sticks, large size with a tasty & crunchy batter.  Had the "Meat me on Murray" pizza with pepperoni, sausage, bacon, ham & salami. If you want a meaty pizza, this is it!  Oh, and save room for the Tiramisu, excellent!
