So the place is very clean and the people were nice but in my opinion completely overrated & over priced. I ordered a small almond milk tea and a plain diamond bar with no toppings and it was almost $10. The tea was watery and I finished eating my bar before the tea was even made-there was no line and no one waiting ‚Äç no idea why it took that long. The diamond bars are ok-had the coconut , the flavor was decent but it's not anything I can't find cheaper somewhere else. The boba tea choices are also very limited as opposed to other places that have many options and toppings and mixers. So the experience wasn't bad-except for the 20 minutes it took to make a small tea, but with a lot of other tea places around this area this place doesn't really have anything to make me want to come back.
