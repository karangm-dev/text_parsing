As I write this, visions of Sicilian cannoli dance in my eyes. It's the perfect treat, whether enjoyed solo or with a warm beverage. But I also need to wax poetic about the masterpiece that is their Toasted Almond Apple Tart, which I purchased for a dinner party at the ridiculously reasonable price of $18.99. A thing of beauty to begin with. Moreover, Just. So. Good. Warmed up with some vanilla ice cream on the side. Cant wait to return to try some of their other delectable offerings.
