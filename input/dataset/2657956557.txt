This place is so amazing it inspired me to make my first yelp review! I'm absolutely in love with New York style pizza and always trying to find a place. The pizza here is absolutely amazing! It brought back memories of the most amazing NY street pizza joints! Absolutely amazing! The pizza was great, the wings, the garlic knots and the service! And knowing it's family owned only makes it 1000x better to support a family business. Can't wait to come back :)
