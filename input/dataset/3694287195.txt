After checking out several places similar to host our daughter's birthday, we chose Xtreme Air. The party hosts, Noelle and Jayson were great and very attentive. The staff and events planner, Jazzy, worked well with all my requests and let me in nearly an hour prior to the party to decorate with my own supplies and then commented on how great it came together. I am extremely detailed oriented and they covered every base and assisted me the night before when I came in to do a final walk through of the room. Our party was enjoyable and my other daughter already mentioned that she too now wants her party there. Conner checked us out and asked us about our experience and was quite friendly as well. I highly recommend this place and the best thing about it compared to other like facilities other than the amazing prices and service was the cleanliness
