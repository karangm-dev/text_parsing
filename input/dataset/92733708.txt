I hate this place. I was so excited when I got there, it looked very cute I think I just need to give it another chance. I got the avocado toast....THERE WAS LIKE NO AVOCADO that's the main reason I'm feeling disappointed and empty right now. That and the small portions....It was minimal avocado with a boatload of arugula. Their fries were chewy and not the best, seemed like they had been sitting out for awhile. The free water was lit I guess
