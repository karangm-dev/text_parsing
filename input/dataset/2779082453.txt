Ended up here on Saturday night after deciding not to go to the buffet in mandalay due to the wait thereEven though there were only 3 people ahead of us in line at the cashier, it took forever because the cashiers were so slow. The guy who would make sure you would get seated was very nice along with our waiter and the bus people taking old plates. The employees at the food stations were also very nice and approachable. I have to give an extra props to the bus staff though because we never had a build up of old plates because they would be there to take themThe food was decent, but nothing super special other than the new York strip steak and the prime rib. They were the only things worthy in my opinion at the buffet. The prime rib was very tender and moist and tasted great. The new York was very well seasoned, and cooked a perfect medium and was very flavorful. Everything else was pretty bland, especially the desserts. Most of them had very little flavor which upset me because the Oreo cheesecake just tasted like mush, and the key lime tart was also very plain tasting. The one thing that really got me mad about the dessert selection was for MGM advertising as "GRANDer" they didn't even have a gelato bar. Get on the trend MGM, wicked spoon at the Cosmo has it, the buffet at aria has it, cravings at mirage has had it for awhileOverall, I wouldn't come back at the $35 price point. I would much rather go to the wicked spoon buffet or bellagio buffet
