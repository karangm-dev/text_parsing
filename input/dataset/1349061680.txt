With a kitchen open til one in the morning, this place takes care of you for breakfast, lunch and dinner plus the midnite snack. The drinks are reasonably priced and I recommend going deep into the menu. Baseball cut steak, tortilla soup, Thai crunch salad..... This place is far more than just a chop house. Yum.
