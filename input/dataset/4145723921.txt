Paco's Tacos is the real deal! In spite of the great Yelp reviews, I still had my reservations about eating at another TexMex chain. How good could it be I thought? Well they totally nailed it, from the complementary chips and dip to the sauce stains on my napkin!The dining area was empty and only a few people were at the bar upon my arrival for a late lunch. Adlai our server was very helpful with recommendations and was knowledgeable of the menu. I had a overstuffed grilled chicken taco which arrived with Mexican rice, mixed cabbage coleslaw and, their own, Charro style pintos, all at the incredible price of... drum roll please... 7 Bucks! My buddy tried Paco's Taco which is shredded beef and was equally as tasty. Servings are huge and everything was fantastic. Premeal chips and salsa were delivered to the table immediately. The chips are very thin and were very fresh. The place was clean and attractive. Sanitation rating was a 95. For those long time Charlotteans like myself, you may remember this place as the old Manzetti's.I'm going back soon! This place is a Gotta Try!.
