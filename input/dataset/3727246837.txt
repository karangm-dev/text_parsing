One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had in Calgary.  Let me start with the disgusting pig's head hanging at the front door which we found unappetizing as a start.  Maybe the Toronto owners think there is a different culture in Calgary?  Well think again!The smell in this restaurant was terrible - not sure if it was dead fish coming from the open kitchen but it wasn't good.  Wait staff were slow and told us the kitchen was 30 minutes behind but we thought we'd still give them a chance. Drinks came out slow and were small and disappointing. The tartar was small, underwhelming flavour and served on a bone which was also unappetizing.  I could go on - and would give them one more chance - but for gosh sakes wait a few months until they iron out the very large wrinkles. Awful experience for our first Saturday night there.
