They claim to "speak kid" and are "experts in awesome", but that couldn't be farther from the truth. The "stylist" just started combing through my daughters hair and when she hit a snag she just pulled harder. My daughter started crying and the stylist didn't even pause to interact with her other than to tell her to look down.  Not really a great experience for first haircuts.  I would recommend just going to a salon if you have a little girl because she would actually be treated as a person.As if I thought the experience couldn't have gotten worse, the prize my daughter received after getting her haircut was a bracelet that said "hottie"!
