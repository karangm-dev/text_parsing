I have only been to this location once but the gentleman at the counter was kind. I walked in with a roll of quarters to pay for my product and apologized for using change. (Can be quite frustrating considering other customers maybe waiting.) he assured no need to apologize and mentioned he was short on quarters anyway. It was small, but it made a situation that was uncomfortable for me a little less embarrassing. Sir, if by chance you read this, seriously thank you.
