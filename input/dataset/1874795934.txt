It may have been just an off night, but the smell of this place was extremely off-putting. We walked in and immediately we were hit with this dank, bitter smell. Definitely not the smell of chocolate. We sat down and the smell didn't improve. Other than that, our waitress was extremely nice. The c'Wow was pretty good. At first, it looked better than it tasted, but after a while it really grew on us.Overall, not sure where I stand on this place.
