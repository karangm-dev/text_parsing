I came here once and will never, ever go back. I ordered a pasta dish, I can't remember which. I'd eaten about a third of the dish (it did, admittedly, taste pretty good) when I came across a gigantic bug, some sort of cricket I think. And this guy was cooked into the pasta. He didn't just fly in there while I was eating, oh no, he was nicely settled into his carbohydrate nest. After staring at my dish's added protein for about 2 full minutes, I shakily called over our server, who examined my plate with similar horror. She whisked it away and offered me a new one. I wasn't quite the mood but she insisted I take the fresh one to go. Never really worked up an appetite for it, through..
