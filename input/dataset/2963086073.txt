Another Friday Night First... we arrived around 745p. The place was jumpin and the vibe was an immediate hit with us. Old School hip hop playin and modern decor. Another great addition to the neighborhood. Things got even better as the night progressed. The sevice was prefect. Our server Randy had a great personality as well as great menu advise. He made our night very enjoyable. 5 out of 5starsThe Food.. well we left not being able to eat another bite.  It was all soo good. We started with the curry cauliflower and marinated skirt steak w chimichurri. These apps were not only cheap in our opinions, but amazing. For entr√©es we went with the Notorious B.I.G. Burger and the gf got the Ahi tuna sandwich. We also enjoy these.You will find a large selection of beers and wine as well as specialty drinks. We enjoyed quite a few..lolWe will be back many more time. We love the wood fire grill and keep up the great service!
