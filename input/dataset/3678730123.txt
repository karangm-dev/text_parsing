I ordered the Akropolis Pizza and Pork Gyro. The first thing I noticed when the pizza came out was how vibrant the toppings were! You can tell the veggies are fresh just by looking at them. The gyro was one of the best I've had and the fries were awesome. Great service! They really care about giving you a good experience. I will definitely be back!
