We have been here twice now, and both times were great, A++!!!  On our first visit we just ordered two orders of the Spicy California rolls, then on our second visit, we ordered two orders of their avocado rolls, which by the way are only like $3 for 6 pieces, and one order of the spicy California roll, with also an order of their Teriyaki chicken with white rice and four small veggie sides. *** The food was good, but I think what keeps us wanting to come here is the wonderful customer service, they have been AWESOME to us,  we were greeted with an honest smile and we were well taken care of during our entire dining experience there!!! There is a really sweet and kind guy and girl that work at the register too, they are both extra awesome!!We will keep coming for more, hopefully to slowly but surely try-out there entire menu, eventually!!!
