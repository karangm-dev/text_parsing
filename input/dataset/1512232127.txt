I so wanted to love this place because I have not found a great Chinese restaurant since moving here. Unfortunately it's not here and I am still on the look. I ordered general tso's which might not have had actual chicken under the breading.  It was exceptionally dry although I could imagine it might have had good flavor 3-4 days ago when it was fresh. This came with fried rice which had a very heavy smoke flavoring which was unfortunate. The meal also came with an egg roll which is my favorite but this egg roll was simply awful. It had a strong and distinct flavor which I think of as an msg flavor but I really don't know what it is.  I just know it was yucky. Lastly, I ordered crab Rangoon which were cooked perfectly but the crab mixture was dessert level sweet which failed to hit the mark.
