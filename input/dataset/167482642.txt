Decided to go here to see Civil War. Sound quality was crap. Voices were scratchy sounding and there was a light above us that kept blinking. On top of the 20 screaming kids on the theater and people on there phones it was a very unsatisfying show. We wont be back to this theater. I complained to a manager mid movie and they finally got the light to go out but never fixed the sound.
