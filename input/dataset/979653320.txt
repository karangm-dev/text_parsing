After a Christmas party, I vomited all over my suede Stuart Weitzman boots to which it dried and stained.For $30, Kaner removed the dried stains, cleaned it and recolored the suede darker to original black! It looked completely brand new. The setting and vibe of the place does seem questionable but on my way out, alot of regular customers with designer handbags and shoes that said hes only the best ( I asked to make sure).
