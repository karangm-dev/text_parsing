This review is for the tastebud popcorn location in metropolitan plaza. I went in excited to mix and match (they have over 200 flavors) BUT apparently you cant mix and match flavors (so you would have to come in 200 times to taste all flavors). They were really strict with their sample policy, i had crumpled up my cup from my first sample and he asked me to open it up again for my sample. And you can only sample two kinds. AND the smallest bag is 6-10$ depending on what flavor you pick! Not coming back- thanks!
