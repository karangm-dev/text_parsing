Cravings, like The Mirage as a whole,  is FAR BELOW the standard of quality one tends to expect from the better known hotels on the Las Vegas Strip. I cannot fathom how anyone could give this place above one star. My only guess would be that those reviewers just spent a decade or more in prison, and Cravings was the first place they decided to eat upon being released. My boyfriend and I took samples from the majority of the stations and did not find one morsel of quality food. My slice of prime rib was full of fatty pockets, my steamed rice was stale and hard. I mean, seriously, how does one go about messing up steamed rice?? The pizza was flavorless with crust like cardboard and sauce that tasted like ketchup with basil in it. You could find better quality food at Jack in the Box at 3 in the morning on a tuesday night.The one good thing I can say about this place is that our waiter, Dan was very nice and our drinks were always filled. Good looking out Dan, you're a diamond in some deep, DEEP rough.To sum up my experience at Cravings Buffet at The Mirage in two words: NEVER AGAIN!!!
