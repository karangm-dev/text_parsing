Overrated is the first word that comes to mind when I think back to my recent meal at Primanti Bros. For the record, this has been hyped up for some time, and it was my first Primanti Bros experience. Honestly I thought the wings were more enjoyable than the sandwich, which was just ok.I did appreciate that the slaw on top was vinegar based instead of mayo based, which reminded me a bit in flavor of sauerkraut, which would tie back to some German Pennsylvania roots. That aside, the sandwich otherwise was eh. It satisfied but didn't really do much to impress.
