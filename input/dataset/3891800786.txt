I HIGHLY recommend DLK Dental.  Dr. Kowsari and receptionist Rebecca were both quick to reply back to me before I went in for my first appointment to check my insurance coverage and help me feel less anxious about my cleaning appointment. The dental office is modern and clean. They do direct billing.  We had a warm welcome, big smiles all around. I brought my 8 month old for a free quick check and Dr Kowsari gave my husband and I great tips on cavity prevention and general cleaning for infants. When it was my turn in the chair I started off really nervous as usual but Dr Kowsari did a phenomenal job at keeping me calm and informed me every step of the way of the next step. There was a decent sized TV on the Food Network that distracted me as well. She was very thorough with my exam and cleaning but more importantly to me she was super patient and had excellent manners, never made me once feel bad for flinching when I felt gum sensitivity or for not flossing enough. I felt she really took time to provide excellent care. It wasn't as painful as I thought, especially since I haven't had a cleaning since before pregnancy. Probably the least painful from all my dental experiences.  Plus, nowadays you rarely have the dentist do your cleaning so this is a bonus!  The new patient special offer was a good offer. I appreciate the follow-up care instructions.  DLK is going to be our family dentist from now on!
