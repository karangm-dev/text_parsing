My wife and I went here today ,late afternoon ,for drinks and appetizers.  We had the deviled eggs and then also tried the fried chicken on biscuit with pepper jelly. Absolutely the best!!!!  Also, the service was excellent!!! The waiter was very knowledgeable of the menu items and made some great recommendations!!  My wife was so excited when she saw Chef Ryan, Hell's Kitchen winner,In the kitchen.  She came out and said hello to us!!Great day in Vegas and I highly recommend this restaurant!
