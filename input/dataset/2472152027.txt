Planned my day around thinking that we could have brunch here on a Friday afternoon. Website states that weekend champagne brunch is Friday-Sunday. We got ready and walked 15 mins to the buffet to find out that the brunch is only on Fridays during special events. To management: please update your website so that people don't make plans according to wrong information. It ruined the start of my day because I would have planned it completely different if I would have known that the buffet was NOT offered on Friday. I even called before but the wait was so long that I gave up.
