I really wish they would open up a place in San Francisco or New York. We had Cider, Spicy Crab Benedict over potato pancakes, Salmon Benedict and flourless chocolate cake. The breakfast was amazing.  I rarely see everyone at a table finish ever bite of a meal, but we managed.  It's well worth a trip and I look forward to coming back here when I visit Toronto again.
