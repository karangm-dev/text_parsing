This is probably one of my favourite (halal) burger place in Missaussaga. The burgers are juicy yet firm. The sauces and overall taste (especially the Apple Butter BBQ) were very tasty and do not make the burger soggy. The buns are also unique and add to the unique taste. You might hesitate when you first see the place - but don't be fooled, this is one restaurant you should definately try if you like juicy burgers
