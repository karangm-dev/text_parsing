The Fries were supposed to be a lg order, we got a Small order of fries?Called Pizza Shop Back, owner said he took my Wifes order, and said this was what she ordered. I told him i was sitting there when she ordered her Food, Owner said this is what she ordered, I told him we would never order again from his Pizza shop. He Said fine And Hung Up on me. In the Future i  Will never order again.The Pizza Delivery Driver AL Came back to my house a 1/2 hour later with new wings for us. After telling his Boss that he was wrong about our Order, AL works Part Time, Who is a Military Veteran. The Owner doesn't Pay him but 30-40.00 a Night under the Table. Not Hourly??? And Pays no money for his Gas, Not even Minimum Wage???? Whats right with That?????Owner says he Don't Care About No Veterans. I Will Not Order From There Again.My Concerns for AL.Dennis Parks
