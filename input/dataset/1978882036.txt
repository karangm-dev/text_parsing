I don't usually review a gas station/convenience store, but after my poor experience at the Vans Golf Store next door to this, I felt inclined to write a review of the Superpumper. I got a flat tire in my truck, and my 6 y.o. grandson was with me. We pulled into the first available parking lot (Vans), called AAA, and went inside to hopefully wait since it was 110 degrees out. But the Vans employees were so rude, telling us we couldn't "loiter" inside. I reminded them that I had a small child with me, and it was very hot. They just said SORRY. so I went back outside, drove my truck with its very flat tire next door to the Super Pumper and called AAA to update our location. The employees in the convenience store were VERY nice, allowing us to wait inside instead of outside in the heat. A simple gesture of kindness makes all the difference!!!
