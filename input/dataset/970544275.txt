Why haven't I ever been here before?? If you are looking to decorate any corner of your home or outdoor space, please do yourself a favor and go to Hobby Lobby first. The store is huge and offers way more decorating ideas than you could ever imagine. You'll find a plethora of dried and silk florals with every height and shape vase/container available. You can build an arrangement yourself or buy one ready made. They also have fabric material for sewing projects. I don't sew, but I did notice the varieties of colors and patterns. Candles, artwork, baskets, side tables, I could go on and on. I spent an hour and a half here, I closed the place down! The cashier was so nice to offer me a 40% off coupon for the one item I was buying that wasn't on sale, he was so incredibly friendly too.. I can't wait to go back! I just wish they didn't close at 8 and were open in Sunday.
