We just got our pool resurfaced. Our home was built in 1986 and the rebar had starting showing rust and such in 3 places so we couldn't keep the algae at bay, we needed to do this quickly.  I got three estimates from a large, medium and small company.  We reviewed:  How many pools have you built or remodeled so far?, How soon can you do it?, How long to complete?, What is the payment method? And What brand do you prefer to use on resurfacing?  In the end the combined price, timeline and special offers from CDC Pools was the winner.  Cassie Selle was our contact and she was great to work with.  Not only did she explain the products and tiles available, but she also outlined the timeline which could be several weeks.    Our resurfacing lasted 17 calendar days, from the moment they drained the pool to putting in the first month chemicals, however we did in December and not in the busy season.  Some Best Know Methods:  you must see the products at the showroom and feel the textures under water.  Also, see how you like the product in the sun and in the shade.  I kept in touch with both Cassie and Ray, the superintendent (or project manager) via text and they answered very quickly.  My husband and I would recommend CDC pools for having people that care and do a great job.
