I agree with many of the other reviews.  The NO CREDIT CARDS ACCEPTED is a bit ridiculous in this day.  It was WAY overpriced.  The menu selections were really limited, I mean it IS a Pancake House, but there was nothing spectacular about it.  I had the spinach and mushroom crepe.  The crepe part was OK, but the filling tasted like previously frozen cooked-spinach mixed with cream of mushroom soup.  They  gave me a little extra bowl of ICE COLD mushroom soup (which they called sauce) on the plate along side of 3 crepes.  Bland, Bland, Bland......The waitress was OK, but the hostess was pretty "in your face" about the CASH only policy and rudely pointed me to the ATM behind me.   I was able to pull together the cash, without using the ATM, so really no big deal. Would I visit again? No.  Sad, because I thought it would be fun for my kids.
