They have staff problems.  I was in there last week and there was a young woman with a polo shirt on that I'm assuming was management of some sort?  Berating employees in front of customers is just not a good thing.  She made me uncomfortable the way she spoke to the kids that were working there.  There was too much drama going on and (i) the customers shouldn't have to listen to that, and (ii) the "manager" should be more professional.  No one deserves to be talked to that way and if she doesn't know that, she shouldn't be "management".The food was good, however.  The total experience, not so much.
