Been wanting to try this for a while since I love it so much in Cali.  Yuck!! I won't be going back.  I usaually get the salad with carne asada. Well, the lettuce was wilted, the steak was tough not tender like in Cali.  My daughter got quesedilla with fries and I would say the fries were the best thing but is that what they're known for???  They came to ask how was everything?  I showed them the wilted lettuce...the waitress  said oh...I'll tell the manager...and we waited...nothing happened.  The manager didn't come out to say anything or may be she didn't even mention it.  Either way it was bad food here, won't be going back...so disappointed:(
