Such a fun place! It's just a warehouse full of arcade games and pinball machines but we had a great time. We played Indiana Jones pinball, Tetris, Ms. PacMan, and a couple of the retro pinball machines- and we only spent about $5 total. They also have a freezer vending machine with ice cream & hot pockets (with a microwave nearby) and a popcorn machine too.
