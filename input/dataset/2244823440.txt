What a joy!  James is absolutely super in every respect!  Talk about going above and beyond - James came out to do a simple repair on our HVAC, which turned into a more major project.  He fixed it all, and did it per the quote he gave me.  James took the time to check out the entire system, explain to me what he did, and what would need to be done in the future to prevent failures.  A breath of fresh air in a sea of "take your money and run" HVAC companies in Las Vegas.  Before you give your hard earned cash to someone else, give James a call.  He's honest, he's fair, he's a Veteran, and he does what needs to be done.Highly recommended!!!  James has earned my business!
