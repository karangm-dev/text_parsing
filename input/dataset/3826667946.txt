Gina is amazing. She fixed what  Beyond beauty lashes messed up. I had my lashes done for the first time 2 weeks ago. Lashes were wirey! (If that's even a word.) lashes were going every where. Plus so hard and crunchy!! I hated them from the beginning.   I had 5 lashes on 1 lash. Gina removed all the lashes that beyond beauty put on. Plus she did that at no charge. It took 45 min just to remove the old lashes!!  My Lashes were  cemented on good. Gina is truly an artist.she enjoys what she's doing. My lashes look an feel  Amazing. Plus they are so comfortable. I will continue to see Gina even though she is 40 minutes from my house. She's worth it. Gina even gave me instructions on how to take care my lashes. Something that beyond beauty never did. However I have a feeling that any instruction would not have helped anyway. Gina  chair is amazing and very comfortable!!  Lazy Boy chair!! You will love your lashes if Gina does them!! Give Gina a try! You will leave very satisfied . Call Gina at 702-502-1316  Lisa
