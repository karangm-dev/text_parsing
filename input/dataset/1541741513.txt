Love how my items turned out - I would come back again for sure. The entire process was seamless and quick - drop off to ready was about a week b/c of the Easter holiday. I had a tie and men's oxford shirt done - about $20. My items were ready quickly and I received a call when they were ready. I would recommend L&M to anyone looking to monogram something they own! Huge selection of products available for purchase as well. The employees are knowledgeable and will tell you the truth if something you want to monogram won't work. I'll take that over a wonky job done with no apology.
