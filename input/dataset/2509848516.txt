I've been thinking of trying MMA or cross-fit. My old gym's membership is finishing in two weeks and I was thinking of trying out something new. I found rev MMA website through google, they had very little information posted on their website. I emailed them and they told me I had to go there in person.I went over and they still refused to give me pricing information and asked me to book a separate appointment with Jessica! Jessica is standing right next to me reviewing some paperwork and it is after her last client. She refused to get involvedlong story short, after much loud argument and me saying I will not come back another day to know pricing, they told me listen if you are on a budget we start at $128 a month. And it goes up. I picked a tone of "if you do not have any money do not talk to us!"Although it is within my budget, currently paying 149 at my old gym, I will not go back. They appeared unprofessional and clueless. A very negative environment.
