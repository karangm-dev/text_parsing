I love Q Karaoke so I decided to eat at QBistro for the first time! I loved it. When you walk in they have a really nice seating area with booths and one side with half booths half tables. They have Kpop music videos playing and pretty decor in here. The food on the menu is sooooo good. They have a variety of everything. We ordered the bulgogi pizza an order of baked mussels and mozzarella sticks. The bulgogi pizza is essentially a supreme with marinated beef. Very tasty! The mozzarella sticks were awesome can't go wrong with fried cheese. The baked mussels were a 10! I will go back and try more options for sure! The service was very friendly and not rushed at all. She even let me take my drink afterwards to Karaoke Q because we had a room! The drinks were a 10! I ordered the frozen strawberry daiquiri with apple reds and my boy ordered the mango with mikes hard lemonade! So good! I will definitely have to come back and try more!
