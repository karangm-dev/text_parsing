I gave this place two chances, both for brunch. Because I really want to like it...BUTBoth times the food was too greasy for me to eat, and both times the people I have been with, also did not enjoy their food. This last time one of my friends had to send his food back because it was too salty (the ham) and too greasy (the toast). They were nice about it and did not charge him. BOTH TIMES I have tried to convey something to the serving staff, in hopes that it gets to the kitchen- that food is greasy  and items are inedible. Twice the staff has cut me off mid-sentence, and responded that "this is how item x is made," - as if customers were not eating at other restaurants (even the same dishes; something basic, like a hash brown!) without this trouble. Some perspective: paying customers should be able to order food that they can and want to eat, no matter what. Always. Even if it's fried. It's understood some items on the plate are fried in fat, but the dish should not be unpleasant, revoltingly oily, even if it has a fried component. The hash browns are literally, round oil sponges. Disgusting. This is the oiliest brunch in town. Hands down. It's a shame because the space is so beautiful and open. It feels like maybe in trying to do things in a unique way, they are ruining them... even the simple ones. I hope it changes!
