Kevin Shroyer recently inspected the condo I am about to buy. He is very personable and one can communicate with him with ease. He is punctual and conducts himself in a professional manner. His inspection report is very detailed and helpful. He goes over every detail and covers everything possibly needed to make a decision. He gave me a small gift after the inspection was over, which was extremely nice of him. Wonderful person and a professional!  I highly recommend his services!
