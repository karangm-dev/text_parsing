I really liked this gym when I went there. My whole family and I were longtime members. However, we got billed for our membership the day before the gym closed and we still haven't got our money back. Refund checks were supposed to go out March 1st I believe. It is now March 23rd and we still aren't refunded . My uncle paid for the whole year and still hasn't got his refund as well. They are promoting a new gym they are collabing with, Aspire Fitness while AZ Elite members haven't got refunded. Me and my family will not go to Aspire Fitness because we have lost our trust with the AZ Elite owners. They are also very unprofessional because while I was a member in July I had a job interview and I never even got a email back as if I got the job or not. I'm not angry I didn't get the job but I am upset I didn't even get an email saying I didn't get it.
