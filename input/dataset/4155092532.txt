Yikes. $150 for a drink, salad, side and steak. I ordered the American wagyu ribeye and was billed for the Japanese wagyu. No idea which I was served, but regardless it was sub-par--thin and somewhat dry. I might have complained, but the server at the bar couldn't even keep my water glass filled, so why bother? Not recommended.
