I've been working in the area for the past week. All I've heard is how great the Indian food is in the GTA. I made a dash for Tavva for lunch one Saturday. I can tell you I was completely underwhelmed. I travel to India 2 times a year and I really love all the variety of food there. I'm no expert but I do know real Indian food. This was good for a quick fix on an Indian Food craving but nothing more. I was the only one there for lunch - not a good sign- and they had this muzak turned up too loud. That's just weird.  I had the Chicken Tikka Masala and a paneer dish. The paneer was alright. The Chicken Tikka was not. The sauce was run of the mill but the chicken didn't have that nice charcoal flavor. It was simply cooked on the grill in the kitchen and had no flavor. The naan was nothing to die for. It wasn't bad but a bit too doughy. I cannot recommend this for anyone except the most desperate Indian Food addict in a long over due need of a binge. It's so-so.
