THIS PLACE ROCKS!  Definitely one of the best sushi in town.  We went 2 weeks ago to celebrate our friends birthday.  We couldn't stop ordering rolls!! The service was great, the sushi is so fresh and tasty.  The value is great too, won't break the bank! Last week I celebrated MY birthday at home, I decided I wanted them to cater.  My wife ordered $200 worth of sushi we fed 20 people and everyone was amazed at the quality of sushi and needless to say, we all enjoyed it.  I highly recommend this place, it's in my top favs.
