Reviewing the Sushi* From someone who works at a 5 star sushi restaurant.* For the price, it's a magnificent ripoff.The nigiri is cut paper thin, unlike other sushi bars i've been to where you're served an actual cut of fish. If you're paying $5-$8 for two pieces of fish, give me an actual ****ing piece of fish. Sushi rolls were good as far as flavor, but again, $16 dollar special rolls cut very thin and not much in regards to portions Fish was fresh though, which is good. Rice was laughably bad though, which is not so good. It was dry, not very sticky, and had no flavor to it. tl;drLearn how to cook rice, dont skimp on portions of fish, stop putting cream cheese in 80% of your rolls, and learn how to make a decent rainbow roll.
