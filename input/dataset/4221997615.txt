This is not a good Dairy Queen. Almost every time I've tried to go, I get the worst customer service. The employees are all very rude and uncaring of their job. The only time I've gone once was when a guy took our order and he joked and talked to me and my friend. Every other time, I'm greeted with rudeness from a bunch of high schoolers. I will not be coming back.
