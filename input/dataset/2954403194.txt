Went here last weekend for a birthday celebration and was very disappointed. We didn't get appetizers until an hour and half since we sat down and that's after we asked for bread or something (which we were THEN told they have complimentary edamame). We spent so much money and they messed up the salads and forgot items...all with the server apologizing that they didn't think they'd be busy (even though we had reservation). The whole time a manager didn't stop by and we sat next to a loud obnoxious party. I gave 2 stars for the beautiful ambience, but the portions were small and taste and service not great for these prices.
