One word:overpriced.  I got the basic chicken sandwich ($5.95) and although it had a good flavor, it was very tough (see picture...and the sandwich itself was $5.95 with no sides).  Service was slow and yet there was no line.  We tried this place several times when it first opened and swore we wouldn't go back, but we were given a gift card so we gave it another try...save your money and go to Cook Out.
