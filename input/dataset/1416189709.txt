Yes yes yessss! Chandler food truck Friday, date night. We got the jazzy....Came out piping hot. Carne asana was melt in your mouth good. Love the mixed greens instead of boring iceberg lettuce. Could have used a touch more cheese but I'm not complaining. The pico de gallo was delish too. Did I mention the homemade strawberry lemonade? My husband is super picky but loved this and so did I. We will be back!
