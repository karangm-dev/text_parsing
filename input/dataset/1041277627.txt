I decided to make a trip here recently since I adopted a senior cat and was testing out new foods for her. I spent maybe 10 minutes in total browsing at foods and reading ingredients list, since I was intrigued by the flavours and brands that I hadn't seen anywhere else before like Wild Calling in Alligator and Merrick GF line. An employee came by to ask if we needed help, which was nice.BUT when I went to cash out, the man working there was old and horribly grumpy. My boyfriend paid for some things. And when I saw a sample sized pack, we tried to pay for it but he just threw it at my boyfriend and said it was a freebie (as if he was mad we were taking the free stuff???) This really isn't how shoppers should be treated.
