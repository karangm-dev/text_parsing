I called ahead and asked when I was visiting in Vegas if they could do an oil change and brake inspection.  They said they were slow and could have me out in 2 hours tops.  I drive there which was 20 minutes from my hotel and all the sudden they are 4 to 5 hour wait time.  I hate service shops that say whatever to get you in and then they totally waist your time.  The guy apologized which is why they get 2 stars instead of 1.
