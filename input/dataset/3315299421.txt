Worst service ever. My boyfriend and I have heard great things about their wings so we decided to try them out. We went in and sat at the bar to order food to go. We put in our order and my boyfriend got a beer while we waited. After his first glass he asked for a taste sample of another beer. He didn't like it so he got another glass of his usual beer. We saw the kitchen place to go food by the register. The bartender continued to serve other guests. She closed out checks and even went to the dinging room and cleared dirty dishes. The whole time we were hoping that wasn't our food sitting there. She had walked by it and saw it there for 15 min! Finally she brought it to us and gave us the bill. She charged us for the sample my boyfriend asked for! I couldn't believe it! She let our food sit there and then charged us for a sample?! Horrible horrible service. Needless to say we will never be back
