One of the best dinners I've had in Vegas this whole trip! The waiter was super personable and the food was DELICIOUS! Had the ricotta gnocci, and although it was a definitely a small serving for pasta, it was incredibly filling! I'm not really a fan of red sauce, but I basically sopped up the Bolognese sauce! I will definitely be back each time we come back to Vegas.
