Walked in to grab a 2 samosas to curb my hunger. Me: Hi! Can I have 2 beef samosas warmed up please. Girl at the counter: 1 beef samosa?Me: No two beef samosas please. Girl at the counter: warmed up?Me: yes....ugh The samosas themselves were terrible. Hardly fresh, not crispy, too salty. Never eating samosas from here again.
