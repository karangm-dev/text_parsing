First time trying out Asian style with Mexican style place! The food is great! It gets crazy packed here as well. Service is pretty fast! I do believe this place needs to have nicer decorations and designs and maybe better location cause the food is so good, more people are going to come! I do want one like this in flagstaff as well! Haha hopefully the business owner can read this and expand their business cause for sure it'll be the biggest hit in northern AZ. Loved my experience here. Price is very affordable as well! Thanks :)
