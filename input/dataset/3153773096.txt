Tacos were really good the handmade tortillas were awesome!!! I would love for them to add carne asada to the all-you can eat menu . Salsas were very good they weren't spicy for those who don't like spicy food.  For me I like my food spicy. I tried my kids churros and they are to die for !!! Great job Fun Tacos will be back for more .
