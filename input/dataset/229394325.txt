My sister had her wedding last night, so we were looking for somewhere to have a big family breakfast this morning. I thought, "Saddle Ranch is big and I'm sure it'll be pretty empty at breakfast." I really wasn't expecting great food just somewhere we could all get together. I called an hour before they opened expecting to leave a message and someone answered. She took care of our reservation for 24... Yes 24 lol. She let the cook and staff know ahead of time and they were ready for us. We got our food in a timely manner and the manager checked on us several times. They mixed up one order but quickly corrected it apologizing profusely. I had the pancake breakfast it was good. There maple peppered bacon is really tasty so is there sausage. My daughter loves her pancakes. My husband liked his steak an eggs. But the best plate in our group was by far the chicken and biscuits. It's chicken, eggs (however you like them) biscuits, bacon gravy, with green onions on top... Sooooo good. I usually only go to Saddle Ranch for drinks but I will be eating chicken and biscuits from there soon. A couple bites from my neice wasn't nearly enough.
