On a whim, I decided to order pizza.  I had never even heard of this place, but I saw all the good ratings... I was not disappointed! I ordered a large pizza with pineapples only.  Many places assume I wanted a Hawaiian pizza and add ham- this place didn't make that mistake!  I also got some cheese sticks and they were awesome.  Don't order here without throwing in some cheese sticks.  Seriously.  This was my first time ordering through the Yelp app and I would do it again.  I ordered at 5 pm on a week night and it took less than a half hour for my order to arrive.  I won't expect that quick turn around on a weekend, but I will definitely order from here again!!
