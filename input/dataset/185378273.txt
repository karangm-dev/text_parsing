Being a huge car guy, I thought I would try out Scottsdale Muffler.  Called, made an appointment to get a muffler that I bought installed on my Jaguar S Type R.  I showed up on time, and in a few minutes they took my car around.  Then they called me out to show me that it wouldn't fit.  I really liked that, because rather than give me some story, they showed me the issue and explained it thoroughly.Fast forward a few weeks.  I buy the correct muffler, make an appointment, show up, and they take the car around on time.  A few minutes later I hear them working on the car.  In an hour, they were done.  Top notch welding, no BS, and they didn't mine working on my luxury car, all while respecting my time and busy schedule.  Very reasonable labor rate too.I will be back in the future and highly recommended!!!
