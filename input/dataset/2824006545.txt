Date of Incident: 11-5-2017RE: HOMEWOOD SUITES BY HILTON / VEGASI will NEVER come back to the HOMEWOODS, VEGAS. It seems like a SMALL matter, but it's not.  It's about CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I made a SIMPLE request; can you please send someone to clean my room.  I made this request at 2 pm, 3 pm and 4 pm to NO AVAIL! I had made this same request to the cleaning staff that was across from my room at 11 am.  The reply from each front desk staff was I will call the cleaning staff and have they come to my room.  By the way, the hotel was empty.The last call at 4 pm was answered by a person named Moses. He was rude, over talked me, and just NOT Nice.  He kept interrupting me and over talking me. I said to myself is this behavior supported by their manager Brandy Breault.  Here is the following Customer Service experience:1.  Unresponsiveness2. Rudeness3. No Apologies4. No Empathy5. Argumentative6.  Lack of Customer Service in General.7.  Treated like my like request was over unfounded.  A request to clean my room. Really?Wow! Is this the Hilton Brand?  Is this how Homewood by Hilton treats their paying customers....What would you do if you were treated in such fashion?Hilton Honor Member: 170335441
