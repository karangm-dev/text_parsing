Got away from Ventura and was in LV for Memorial Day Weekend.  Hit this spot Sunday for dinner.  Great environment, staff and food was just great.   Great chips, salsa as well.   My kinda place for sure.  But expect some wait bc this joint seems to be popular *(but well worth it for all of us that went) A++++
