I am very conflicted writing this review. There is an amazing cashier named Julie who makes my experience at this No Frills special. Other than Julie, the only reason I continue to shop at this No Frills location is because it is a 2 minute drive from my house. This store always seems to run out of items that are in the flyer.  Currently, potatoes are on sale but on Monday they have run out. The owner is a miserable man whom I have seen berate customers and give them stare downs. The aisles always seem too crammed, don't get me started on the checkout metrics. On the weekend, there are times when customers can't get by the checkout lines that are so long. I have been going to Food Basics recently which is a fifteen minute drive as I have found more items available.
