I went to this location for the first time a few weeks ago and notice how it was not so busy when they usually are. Figure I was there on low traffic. Well today I figured it out, this location employs some of the rudest, nastiest lazy people I have ever seen. Your cashier are just nasty not friendly at all very unhappy people and they show it on other. The have the sense of customer service that a piece of furniture has. All this should tell you how unpleasant my visit there was but hey it will never happen again because will never set foot in this place again. And yes I will share this on my facebook also.
