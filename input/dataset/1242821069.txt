Disappointed. I got the ribs and chicken kabob with fries. They are definitely not generous with the fries. My wife got the 6 oz. Sirloin with fries and same thing. The only thing that brings me back to Outback is the Bushman Shrooms which they have taken off their menu but will still make if asked. From now on I'll order then to go and get my meal elsewhere.
