This place is crap, extremely overpriced. The food is garbage. We were a party of three and all three of us did not enjoy the food. The wait and service were just as bad. We waited quite a bit, then the buzzer went off, we went up they took out buzzer and then forgot about us. Haha. That's awesome. I would highly recommend any of the hundreds of other restaurants in Vegas other than this one. Sorry, Guy, try again.
