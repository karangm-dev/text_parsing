Wow...did we ever stumble on a little gem....since we are fresh off Vancouver...finding yummy food that's worth spending is hard to find in Calgary!  Yes Vancouverites are spoiled with the plethora of food offered there.  Nevertheless the staff was fast and friendly and entertained my toddler and gave him two lollipops...yes..he did quite the rendition of a song.  We came from Confederation park and stumbled upon here on a rainy day.  Always gotta be good if there are people outside eating right?  Gotta love hole in the walls.  Their do airs are to die for and their sauce is phenomenal!  Definitely worth the drive here!  NOM NOM NOM....I wish I could freeze their yummy food...lol
