Our first time trying cajun seafood in bags was across the street from Urban Crawfish at H&J. Don't get me wrong, I love H&J and when I came back home to the Midwest and tried other places like this, nothing was comparable to H&J!I found Urban Crawfish on Yelp and it had amazing reviews for being new. So I told my husband I would bookmark it and the next time we are in Vegas, we should stop here to see what the hype is about. It was definitely comparable to H&J, but I felt the flavors that Urban Crawfish were much better! It's just something about their Urban mix that makes it delicious! It has some asian tastes to it as well, maybe that's why I like it better? I mean H&J does too and I'd go to both, but if I had to choose, I'd go with Urban Crawfish.Their prices aren't bad either. My husband and I always share a bag because I mainly eat the shrimps, clams, and mussels. Between the two of us, it's like $40 before tip and tax.I will also give them a 5 Star because they were short staffed and super busy one night when we went in March. We waited nearly an hour for our food and the server came to tell me there was a mishap and our food didn't get put through the system and it would take another 30 mins. I was not having that and let them know..the manager apologized and gave us 50% off our bill. Kudos for caring about your customers.
