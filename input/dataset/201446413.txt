We came for Sunday brunch and the price was very fair, about $37. The wait wasn't too bad, only around 45 minutes.I know you're not suppose to fill up on carbs at buffets, but man, the pizza was so good I could not resist. They has a seafood pizza with shrimp and it was for reals so heavenly *drool*. Also, the crab was great, the duck was yummy and honestly, I didn't have anything that I didn't like.I really want to come back here for dinner sometime! So far it's been my fave buffet in Vegas. I'd choose this place over Wicked Spoon for sure.
