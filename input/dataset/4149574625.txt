I would've had a better evening if I stayed home and opened a can of SpaghettiOs. That is an insult to whoever makes SpaghettiOs. We had four different dishes, each one came with the same tasteless brown colored tomato sauce, unless you consider tin a flavor. Everything on the menu was overpriced they include house wine that tasted like vinegar, the soup was lukewarm, have no idea what the salad tasted like, the garlic bread was exactly that garlicky nothing else to it except grease. Plus it cost $13.00 to split a meal. Worst food ever.
