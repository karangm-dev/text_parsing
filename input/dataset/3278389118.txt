Club Pilates Spring Valley is the most amazing club! Victoria the owner is so welcoming as are her instructors Amy, Corinne and Michelle just to name a few. The members are down to earth and we have so much fun it doesn't even feel like a work out. I have lost 30 lbs in four months. I would highly recommend Club Pilates Spring Valley I won't work out anywhere else!
