This is my first stay at this resort. I have stayed in resorts all over the world for many years. This has been my biggest disappointment ever! The photos on the Sheraton website are very deceiving. The deluxe one bedroom photos are actually a standard condo.  On all other sites on the internet this condo is listed as a standard and the larger unit is the deluxe. Beware, there is no cook top or stove.  Very disappointing. My reservation stated burners in lieu of stove.  But oh no, not the case, only a microwave. Have you ever tried microwave boiled eggs? It's a disaster. So, on my fifth day, the resort calls me to offer a larger unit with a full kitchen.  Too little, too late. Why did it take them this long to try to rectify all of this.  Well, it must have been all of the bad reviews I have been writing about them.  There is only a poolside restaurant available. The one bedroom deluxe is very small, not adequate for more than one person on a seven day vacation. I would not recommend this resort
