We came at 5:30, only one other table was sat.  We ordered 6 rolls and waited an hour for the first 5 and another 30 for the 6th.  Why didn't they make all 6, we ordered all 6 at the same time?  The waiter appeared confused about what he was doing the whole time.  We've been coming here with our family for a long time and it seems like something has changed.  Long waits, poor service and clearly friendly is not in their vocabulary - its not worth it.  We'll be trying a new place.
