Holy mother of veganism this place rocks!I'm an occasional meat eater and not ashamed about admitting it. But going to this place makes every carnivorous instinct in my body shrivel with shame. If more places like this exist, there would be no more meat-eaters in the world. I know it.Seriously, every dish I've had here beats its non-vegetarian counterpart by several strides. The fake chicken tastes better than real chicken, especially when it's seasoned so well here. Everything from the eggless spring rolls to the "fake" meat bowls and flatbread pizzas is wonderful. Top any dish with endless toppings for just $1 and finish your meal with a tsoynami dessert.I only wish there's a place that is equally delicious in San Francisco. There probably is, but I just can't seem to find it...-----Distinguishing factor: This gem offers some of the best vegan dishes you will ever have. Especially in AZ.
