Tastes ok but this place is always a problem in refill the dishes during buffet... Takes at least 30+ minutes to refill.  During my visits they did once and other times not refilled even when I finished lunch leaving the place.  I think it's their strategy NOTE : careful while using soup bowls/plates, they need to clean their dish washer first before they clean plates/soup bowls.
