Located in the sprawling suburb of Brampton this community centre is a great place for anyone that is interested in being active from young and old alike. There is a massive swimming pool, with a very large slide, kids pool and lanes dedicated for proper cardio swim.  There is also a hockey rink, a figure skating rink, basketball courts and a very large gym with a track.  The gym does get busy after work hours but its a good crowd.  The only thing missing in my opinion is an indoor soccer field, however a short jaunt down sandlewood and you will find a huge indoor soccer complex on the corner of Dixie rd. Enjoy.
