As an update to my review - I wanted to mention DEPOSITS.  IT is very expensive to move in here - $200 key deposit, 1 month HOA fees, 1 Month Security Deposit, 1 month rent - $500 pet deposit if you have an animal.  (will say that I got my HOA deposit back in a few days and they were great.)Nevada regulations state that all security deposits must be returned WITHIN 30 days of the end of the lease.  They also state that accompanying the returned deposit must be an itemized account of all and any deductions.   From a deposit of $3,500 I today received a check (7 days late of Nevada regulations) for $262....    I had done a walk thru with a lady from the leasing office who said it was one of the cleanest and best move outs she had seen.    Even though there is a $250 cleaning fee I had paid to have it cleaned.   7 days lateNO description of what deductions were for.Nevada State law also states that the ONLY "non refundable deposit" is for cleaning.  Yet Turnberry are helping themselves to 50% of the $500 pet deposit.    I have been told that is the case with many others who have moved out - I don't know personally because I never got an account of what MY deposit was spent on......I have heard this same story for at least 6 other people recently but just didn't expect it to happen.  tsk tsk tsk.......Not good Turnberry not good.  How the hell do you not get sued monthly by tenants!!!
