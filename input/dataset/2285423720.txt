The 2 stars is for the service. We went to the breakfast/brunch buffet on the weekend of the GGG vs Canelo fight. The hostess and server were very rude and unprofessional. We've never had issues at the mirage buffet. The food is also really good. That morning the service was unprofessional and unacceptable. They must of forgot about customer service.
