I just ordered here from just eat for the second time.The first order of salmon teriyaki and salmon was delicious and satisfying.This time I ordered the chicken teriyaki and beef ribs. What I got was a cold soup with hard rice and 4 minuscule pieces of beef which were on top of it, at least half fat and cost 6$.The chicken barely had any flavour and the vegetables either. I'm really disappointed I wish I could get my money back but I will not be re-ordering.Maybe it's because it's a Friday night? The quality has declined drastically!
