Just like reviewers before me who have the same to say...I desperately WANT to like Kiva Han. In fact, I always attempt to justify their low quality coffee, bitterly awful lattes, and subpar lunch food as "Well, maybe this is just a one time thing?". It's not. It never has been. And today was the last straw.I met a friend for coffee because really what other choice do I have? Starbucks - a corporate overpriced coffee shop? Caribou - running into the same problem? Crazy mocha - if only the one in Oakland was bigger? So we settled for Kiva Han, it has a creative, funky atmosphere and we could sit outside and enjoy the beautiful day. I grabbed their medium roast coffee, not because I wanted to, but because this was their only choice. They usually never have more than one roast *surprise*.To my dismay, the coffee tasted like dirt. This comes as know surprise though, their coffee is always wretched. I've tasted better coffee in a Holiday Inn hotel room. They obviously do not put any care into choosing their beans (if they even use freshly ground).On to their food. I have never ever eaten anything good here. I had a curry wrap once that tasty more like a mouthful of cumin and turmeric, rather than a spicy blend of well paired Indian ingredients. One friend perfectly described the food at Kiva Han "It's like a bunch of hipsters got together and picked ingredients that sounded exotic and cool, even though they taste terrible together!"
