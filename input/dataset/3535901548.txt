Totally awesome experience!!  Usually when you have Botox, results to take effect are  24-48 hours. After only 25 units, a small amount as a touch up (I didn't have 60 units or any massive amount), I got home 1 hour later and couldn't believe my eyes! It. Was. Amazing. A very dramatic difference. Very happy & will return. Highly recommended.
