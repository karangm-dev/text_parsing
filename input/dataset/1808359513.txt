We found this place from reading Yelp. Ohhh my!! What a find!!! I wish we lived here to come every week...maybe every day...Truly one of the most unique ways of cooking food. The bacon had a smokey, maple glazed flavor that was out of this world!!! Everything we ate had such an incredible flavor...will definitely spread the word to family who lives here, and come back when we visit. WOW!!!
