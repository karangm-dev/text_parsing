I was in Independence for a job fair as I'm moving back to Cleveland soon, and after I was finished about 1 PM I was totally famished and in the mood for a nice lunch.  I checked Yelp and saw that DiBella's had good reviews and was just down the road so I gave it a try.  That was a great idea!  There was virtually no wait and I ordered a medium Godfather.  After I saw it being made, I was worried that it was going to be too much to handle because it was huge.  The large looks like it's made with a whole loaf of bread.  It made a subway sub look like a hot dog by comparison.  The bread was fresh made and it had plenty of genoa salami, capicolla and spicy ham.  It was the best sub I've had since I was in the Navy in Newport RI where the "grinders" are the real deal.  The sandwich was so good I killed it!  I can't wait to go there again the next time I'm in the area.
