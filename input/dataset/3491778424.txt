Came here for breakfast Saturday morning on a whim and I was not pleased. Orders were placed and I received the wrong hash. When the waitress came over I told her, but she didn't really respond she just kind of walked away to check what she entered into the system. She comes back and says she rang it in correctly and wasn't sure why I had received the wrong item. She was nice overall even though that interaction was a little weird. The food came out relatively fast after she put in the right order. When I did receive my food, it was fine at first but I saw the eggs were so scrambled it seemed as though there were no eggs at all or maybe they weren't cooked all the way because the entire dish was just wet. Usually eggs are noticeable in any hash, this one was just covered in cheese and the potatoes were also greasy.  I also ordered the Spanish latte which was just ok (it's not really fair to compare real cuban coffee to an American cafe I guess). My dining experience here lead to an entire day of an upset stomach and feeling lethargic. I wouldn't come back to try anything else unfortunately.
