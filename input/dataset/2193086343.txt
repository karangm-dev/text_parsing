We used to love this place but yikes it has gotten pricey and the food is not that amazing.  We spent $65 for two burgers, onion rings and a beer!  Even by vegas standards that is pricey for a couple of burgers!  The wait is long and the atmosphere is crazy noisy at best.  This used to be a favorite vegas stop, but I think I have been there for my last visit.
