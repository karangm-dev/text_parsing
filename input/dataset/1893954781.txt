They have absolutely not one ounce of ability to direct traffic or organize the vehicles as for easy exit. It took 2 hours and 25 minutes just to leave the parking lot. I've been to concerts, football games, baseball, hockey, basketball, rodeo, monster truck, college football bowl games and the Indy 500 NONE took more than 30 mins to leave, NASCAR should drop Las Vegas Motor Speedway from the series.
