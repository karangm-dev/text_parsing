I have a 840 sq ft place here (now 13 months),  it is two bedroom and two bath.  When I was shown the apartment the lack of lighting in the living room or either bedroom was not pointed out to me as I believe it should have been.  That is just the start.  The rent it turns out is $300 or more for a comparable apartment in the area.  When I moved here I was under a serious time crunch and basically had to find a place faster than I would like.  The staff in this place are always very nice and very helpful.  I have never had an issue with any of them.  Most of the common areas, at least on the first floor, are extremely clean.  The halls on my level level 4 are dirty and stained.  I believe this to be because few people see my level and therefore they are not as concerned as they are with the more visible areas on the ground floor.  Also on this note the hall areas are concrete, on ground level the concrete is glazed or coated, level 4 has bare concrete so it stains and show dirt and grime very easily.  I like that the gates are actually in working order and used at all times of the day and night.  I do not like that the expensive track lighting bulbs that I am forced to accept as the provided light in the kitchen and the dining room (remember the living room and bedrooms have no lighting)are not provided by the complex.  The parking spaces are tint!!!!!  Overall the apartments are very nice but over priced by at least $200 if not $400 per month.  Look else where and you will find similar places at much more reasonable prices.
