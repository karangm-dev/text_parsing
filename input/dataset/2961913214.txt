Are you kidding me!? This was SO freakin' fun I cannot even put it in words! I have honestly never painted a day in my life and I managed to pull off a pretty amazing painting (maybe it was the beers! haha---which by the way were happy hour $3.50/each with $5 pizzas?! so even THAT was amazing! All deals you get at the bar when you're there for Paint Nite! The night we went, we were at PT's on W. Post Rd). It was a night so worth it. Had so much fun and so many laughs and then you take home a finished product. I will definitely be doing it again! And update: We did it again, with 6 of us from my family! Had a great time 2nd time around too!
