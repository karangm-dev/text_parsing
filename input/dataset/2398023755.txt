I found Dr. McAdams on yelp and the reviews here are right on!! I have bounced around from dentist to dentist, and I think I have found the dentist for me. I have had a problem with a tooth for years now and have seen 3 dentists about it. After seeing Dr. McAdams, my tooth was fixed within one week and I am thrilled with the results. He is very honest as well and will give you an update about things that need to get done right away and other things that can wait. I didn't feel like he was trying to sell me something as I have with previous dentists. Highly recommend!!!!
