I have only eaten here once, but I have to say I was impressed enough to write a review.  I am a huge fan of breakfast and I have to say I was very happy with my visit.The decor, layout, and location are pretty awesome. The choice of music playing was also near and dear to my heart as I think they ripped off my iPhone playlist while I was there, that is a personal preference I know, but music alone would be 5 stars. The group I was with got kids pancakes, sandwiches and omelets and they all looked great and tasted wonderful.  Most breakfast food does't come out plated so well.  Not that it is necessary, but it shire is a welcome surprise.  My Mocha was excellent.  My only minor qualm is that the staff seem to think you have eaten there before and are not very helpful with the menu when you order.  The staff that brought out our food and checked on us were awesome, so I don't really knock it for that.I will definitely be back.Try: * Greek Omelet * Killer Breakfast Sandwich * Mocha
