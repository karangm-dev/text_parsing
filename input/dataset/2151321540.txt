Like most fast food joints, this place is repulsive. Props to them for having a vegetarian burger on the menu though. Perhaps this place wouldn't be so gross to me if I wasn't coerced into eating there so much. The first time we went, I thought it was alright, but the veggie burger wasn't impressive, being oily and just as bad for you as anything else they make. After revisiting the place a few times, I couldn't even stomach the burger anymore. I've tried a few other things on the menu, including the farmhand bowl and some of their breakfast things. Even worse. It's great if you're starving and in a hurry, but unappetizing if you have other options. Of course after awhile I finally put my foot down and refused to go back, never again.
