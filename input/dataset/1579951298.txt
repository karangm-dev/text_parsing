This restaurant is tucked away in a little plaza but one of those places that is a hidden treasure! My sister told me about it so we went to have a glass of wine and a pizza and it was amazing! It's super cute and home style Italian looking! It reminded me of an Italian restaurant I used to love in Chicago! The cheese and bread  is home made and delicious! The pizza was awesome and I can't wait to go Back to try the pasta and everything else!
