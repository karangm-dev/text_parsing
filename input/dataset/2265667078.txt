PHOF, what a fantastic experience I had last night! So many memories brought back all in one room. As with most arcades the games are all in rows. And there aren't JUST pinball machines there is Ms. Pac-Man, The Simpsons, a super old goalie game, shooting games, air hockey, and Zoltan! The games were grouped together by type of game, I loved the organization. There were different pinball machines sprinkled throughout the rows, besides the two/three full rows of pinballs. And I appreciate the cards with all of the info on each of the games such as what year the machine was made, how many were made and which machine that particular one is, perhaps having them typed up would make them more noticeable? My favorite pinball machines were The Flintstones, Twilight Zone, and Shaq(I made a basket!)There's an area blocked off from the games with a drink/frozen food machine and a 25cent popcorn machine. Food machine was out of order. I noticed there is a microwave! It's also important not to put any food/drink on the games as wellThe vibe of PHOF is awesome, there were sooooMany different people. Groups of friends, a young kid meandering by himself, an older couple on their first date(I'm perceptive)....
