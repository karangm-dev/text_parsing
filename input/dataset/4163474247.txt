Sorry but our experience was horrible.  Arrived for dinner.  The doors and bar area were open to the outside but no misted were on.  The restaurant was hot.  Arizona in August is too hot to have the place open to the outside.  The service was not any better. The waiter brought chips and salsa but no little plates.  There were 5 of us so it was difficult to eat the chips. He brought the small plates for the salsa when he brought the dinner.  I don't get that.  2 of the 5 dinners were not what we ordered.  I don't think we will be going back
