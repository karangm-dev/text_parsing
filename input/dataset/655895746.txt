Highly suggest for wedding hair! I booked this place for my March 10, 2018 wedding. I was really indecisive about my wedding hair. I brought in pictures of my dress and explained at least one thing I was sure about, and then the hair stylist was able to read my mind and did my hair exactly how I wanted it when I wasn't even sure how I wanted it. She must have been clairvoyant. Highly suggested for unsure brides.
