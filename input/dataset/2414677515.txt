My husband and I renewed our vows for our 20th anniversary.  I chose the chapel because the pictures we saw were beautiful.  Dave, the photographer didn't disappoint!  The staff were very professional from my first phone call, to helping with music, and pictures. The bridal room was nice as well as the chapel. Everything was well organized and we didn't feel rushed.  Our experience was well beyond our expectations.
