Birthday (and special occasion cakes), pastries, pies, bread, sandwiches - you cannot go wrong with anything you choose.  The Christmas cookie trays may be a bit pricey - but they are well worth it.  West Side makes the best birthday cakes we have had.  The decorators are artists and can take any concept and make it come to life even better than you might have imagined it.
