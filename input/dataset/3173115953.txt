Squarz is a hidden gem. The owner/baker is so friendly and takes the time to describe the menu. I've had the chocolate croissant, Kouign Amann, and mac & cheese. Everything I've had here has been top knotch. The Kouign Amann is a stand out (buttery, flaky, and not overwhelming sweet).I can't wait to come back to try the entire menu. Also, if you buy 5 pastries, you get the 6th for free. More incentive to be a glutton!
