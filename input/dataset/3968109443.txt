We've shopped at this Loblaws for years and always had a good customer service experience throughout our shopping until most recently when they hired on this lady at one of the cash registers. This review is ONLY specific to "Nancy" who worked Till #11 on Sunday August 10th, and ended her shift at 7:30:She left her till at the end of her shift and us (her last customers before her break) without a word, and did not assist us in finishing bagging our groceries.  She didn't even:- say she was going, - ask us if we can finish bagging ourselves or if we needed help, or- follow-through and finish HER JOB and bag our purchases. This is the second Sunday in which we so happen to be putting our purchases through her cash register and it's off-putting that she's consistently given us a terrible customer service experience. The previous incident was she barely used words or spoken language to communicate with us.  English may be your second language Nancy, but you're in Canada, you work at Loblaws, and you are in a position to provide customer service AND THAT REQUIRES TALKING. On top of that, when we wanted to leave a comment about our disappointing experience, there was no clear escalation protocol, or the employees weren't aware what was the escalation protocol, OR they were reluctant to participate in order to protect one of their own or save their own asses.Loblaws employees may think that being unionized is an automatic shield from "doing no wrong", and I am deeply disappointed that we had to encounter these shopping experiences.
