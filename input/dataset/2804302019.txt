I have been to this location 3 times and unfortunately will not return. The first visit there were a few ingredients missing from the order, but as they had just opened, I let it slide. Each subsequent visit unfortunately has just not improved with issues ranging from lack of service to menu mistakes and more (15 min to get drinks, much longer to place an order for meals, food lacking flavor, tacos missing ingredients listed on the menu, etc).I'm not sure why consistency is such an issue, but the food and service here has never been as good as the original location. I will continue to visit the Old Town restaurant, but will not be back to this one.
