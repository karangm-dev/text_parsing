DO NOT USE THIS LENS CRAFTERS!  We paid a lot of money for prescription sunglasses and eye glasses!  We live 40 minutes away!  I received a text that my glasses are in.  My husband drove to pick them up?  They told him they only have my sunglasses!  He leaves 10 minutes later I get a text glasses are in!  My other glasses were ther. THEY NEVER EVEN LOOKED!  We will never use this place again!  Unfortunately the Pearson eye group also will lose us as Customers!  Terrible customer service!  We spend over $1000 a year at Lens Crafters!  Not anymore!
