I wait about 35 minutes to waitress take my order and wasn't busy at all. After my order wait another 25 minutes to get my appetizer. I order vegetarian dumplings and glazed shrimp. Appetizer was good. But my drink long time wait for refilled. Main dishes fry lobster with Fry Rice. But rice wasn't Fry at all. Lobster just plain taste. Basically Poor service , average food quality.
