This place serves some top of the line modern American cuisine. My family and I had to book reservations several days prior to dining here. I love the high ceilings and huge bar in the center of the restaurant. Unless you are a San Diego Chargers fan get used to their bright yellow and blue colors.We ordered the chorizo chile relleno, pan seared scallops, charred octupus, braised beef ravioli and poke tuna. There was plenty of food for our small party. The relleno had some delicious crumbled feta and corn creme on the side. The scallops were cooked to perfection with a golden brown crust and moist all throughout. We loved the beef ravioli. The ravioli is stuffed with some tender beef and the creamy pesto sauce was the best. I really enjoyed my experience here. The ambience was really nice and the service was superb. Definitely book a table way in advance as this place fills up rather quickly. If you are looking for a hip place to dine with some locally sourced ingredients this the spot.
