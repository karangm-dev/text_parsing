Food is usually decent, but unfortunately the atmosphere leaves something to be desired. There's never any music being played (especially on a friday or saturday, really?) It's like a church on sunday in there.  They also never open the window ledge that leads to the outdoor patio--which is a huge plus for most folks that want that "outdoor experience", like Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers or Zinburger's.  Half of the fun of being in arizona is being able to sit at the bar outside, while having the inside feel of the bar.
