Would never return.  Do you think these guys are honest? We've just moved to Las Vegas!!  Loyal BMW customers....I think we have had 10 BMWs altogether.  I walk into this dealership for a pre-inspection report on husband's 528 lease which is up.  The portfolio manager and salesguy inspect and tell me "its in great shape except for one ding and 2 tires" No paperwork but they say "Trust me - we will email you the inspection report--and don't worry! We have BMW financial $$ and you will not owe anything if you turn in your car here to us!"  Fast forward =3 days:  I've spoken to sales again and they promise they will, but they do not send my inspection report and now they will not answer voicemails. (nor will portfolio manager or general manager) I guess we will just order our next BMW from another dealer who actually does want our business.
