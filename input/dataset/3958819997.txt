From NY and was vacationing in Vegas. I was specifically looking for somewhere to dance Latin music on a Fri night. My friend and I tried going to La Casona first but after that wasn't a success we walked down the road to La Jolla: Cover: Yes, there is a $10 cover, if that's enough to turn you away, you probably shouldn't be in Vegas.Drinks: Well made, around $10 - don't remember exactly. Got a free shot just for checking in. Def got drunk that night. Music: GREAT VARIETY. The DJ played everything from Salsa, Merengue, Bachata, Reggeaton, Hip-Hop, House, Top 40, etc.Vibe: There was a good amount of people. It definitely wasn't packed but def not empty. Plenty of room to dance and have a great time. If I had to guess I would say most of the crowd is local but we met a few girls from out of town. Overall: Had A GREAT TIME! Danced the night away and would definitely recommend.
