I've been going here for over five years and it would've been 4/5 stars- especially with my previous stylists who have since left the country. But what prompted this review is a warning to other guys who may get haircuts from their two new male Korean stylists. Not sure if it's just me but they have aha it of just driving their trimmers to the base of your skull... Leaving your skin feeling burned and inflamed. Shame on me for no speaking up but I've always concluded that the start of a shitty haircut cannot be redeemed... So I kept my mouth shut. Anywho, just Incase anyone decides to go there- you've been warned7/15 update: My scalp no longer burns.
