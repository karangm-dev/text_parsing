This review is for the breakfast/lunch buffer priced around $35 per person. I must say I was not too impressed for the price.Pros: -Fast entrance and seating-variety of desserts (delicious creme brulee)-typical drinks (soda, tea, coffee, and juices)-omelette stationCons:-Limited variety of cuisines (typical American breakfast, some sushi, mediocre seafood,)-Bland Fish-bland Miso soupWith all the choices in Las Vegas, will definitely not go back
