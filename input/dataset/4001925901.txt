I've never been a fan of "Hawaiian food". Don't get me wrong, I love to taste new things and try everything at least once, but my first time trying Hawaiian food was not the best experience. ONOS CHANGED THAT! This place was great! The staff is nice, the food is phenomenal, the sauces are amazing, and I just enjoyed my visit overall. I recommend this place for anyone in The Valley to check out.
