Please trust the rating and all other similar reviews before you go here (Don't be like me and not trust the reviews and 'go and try it yourself'). It looks like a really cool ~trendy~ spot to go to, but trust me (and all other yelpers) that this place is not worth it. Very disappointing. Everything looks a lot better than it tastes. Less than average tacos, quesadillas, even chips and salsa (and they have a salsa bar). I've been here both for dinner and "brunch" and both times were 'eh'. The food isn't garbage, but is not the quality that you would expect for such a busy area and a great location. I've also gotten a margarita and mimosa from here and both had the similar reaction of "eh. It's not really bad, just not exactly good or what I was expecting/hoping for."They have outside seating with TVs, which was a plus. The inside decor and seating areas were very cool (with TVs as well). Other than Hot Taco having a great location and really cool and interesting decorations, there food is really just a waste of money.
