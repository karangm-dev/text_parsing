I tried their tacos for the first time at Make Music Madison in central park from the food truck, and now I believe the hype. The brisket was a standout favorite, with some kind of green sauce that was unlike anything I've had on a taco before. Fresh, fresh, fresh flavors. Not a lot of heat, but their house made chili sauce adds even more fresh, piquant flavor. A lot of complexity going on here, flavorwise. The two guys manning the truck were friendly, fun and clearly dedicated to creating a great looking and tasting product, worrying over the wind that was threatening to dislodge the sprig of cilantro on top of each taco. The pork was good, too, but the brisket blew me away. Have you tried the brisket? Try the brisket.
