We had a series of outlets go out and called Dodge Electric to come troubleshoot. As it turns out there was a popped GFI in a room we never go into and that was all that was wrong. Pressed the button and everything was back in order. Dodge was nice enough to waive the first hour labor fee and left with a handshake. Straight up honest people, we will be using them for all our electrical needs.
