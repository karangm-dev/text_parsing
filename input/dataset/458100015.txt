I was really hoping to make this my new pedi spot, as so many of the reviews were great.  But my experience was just mediocre and I'll continue shopping around.  I got the "deluxe", which other than the paraffin wax, was like any other pedicure I've ever had.  Not sure that was worth the extra $10.  She also haphazardly put the top coat on, so it was either thick and goopy in spots or not even covering the color in other spots.  I went the Thursday before a weekend away and it didn't even last through the weekend.
