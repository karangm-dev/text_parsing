This is the best high end steak chain in Madison. It has everything you would want including a very nice atmosphere. It is large enough that you do not feel like you are always right on top of the next table and can have a reasonably private conversation.The service is consistently good, but as with all chains you need to check the doneness of the steak and send it back if it is overcooked. I am pretty picky and they did overcook my steak once, but the free desert to make up for it was appreciated. Only the Tornado Room (the best in Madison) has a perfect record for me in Madison. I have had both very good business meetings and romantic dinners at Flemings. I agree with the other review that says the wine is over priced.
