If I could rate Payless Car Rental a zero I would. The way they present their pricing to customers is fraudulent and purposely misleading. When I booked a reservation online, the stated "estimated" charges for the 2 day rental was $54. When I arrived at the Payless rental car booth the agent asked if $54 sounded correct as the estimated total for the two days. BUT he had the paperwork in his hands that said the total charge would be $184. How could your estimation be so off? They then usher you quickly through signing paperwork so that people who are not careful to read the tiny print (like me) won't realize they're actually paying 3xs more than both the online booking and agent said you would. It's a scam to get people to think they're getting a great deal. Plus to make things worse, the customer service rep actually laughed at me when I called to ask how there could be such a discrepancy between the prices they state on your online booking and the actual rental charge (and why an agent would lie about the estimated charges). This ended up being way more expensive than enterprise who also gives great customer service. So go with them.
