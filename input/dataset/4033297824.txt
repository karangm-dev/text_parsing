I have taken my family to this place before.  We were quite happy with the service and food.  Recently, I bought a groupon for this restaurant.  We were not happy at all with the service and food.  First, they ask if we were using groupon and they marked it in a separate sheet.  We had no service at all.  The restaurant was not full and we saw other tables had their food while they order after us.  We waited for almost 30 minutes only two dishes came.   We spoke to the manager and the Waiter for the rest of the orders.  They said to check on our orders.  My kids got hungry and only ate fried rice that came.  Finally when the order dish came and it was very salty.  We would definitely not recommend this place if you plan to buy Groupon.  We felt we were second class.  We would prefer to go elsewhere where we get excellent service and much better vegetarian food and we don't mind paying the little extra,such as graceful vegetarian by market village.
