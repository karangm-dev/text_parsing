This is the best Indian restaurant in Phoenix, be it Buffet or a la-carte. (I'm a veggie)I have never ever been to any Indian Restaurant and came out so full. Have been to several la-crate in evening and tried lunch buffet today. Every dish was awsome tasty, including Samosa, Gulab jamun, mango custard, Raita, Kheer, DIY Papdi chaat.Usually an Indian restaurant has few star dishes and few OK dishes, but here we tasted every dish and liked it. Surprisingly it is priced lower than other restarunt, may be due to not-so-great ambiance.They prepare fresh Jalebi every evening, but I have enjoyed great taste even after a week in home fridge (Just microwave it for 10-12 seconds). There are several Indian sweets on sale too.Service is a bit slow (or careless) so remind to refill your breads (freshly cooked). You get wheat naan here as part of buffet (a rare feat). You cna't go wrong with this place. Weekend Buffet 8.99 & Kid buffet is $4.99. Looks like week day buffets is cheaper. I'll be coming here again and again.
