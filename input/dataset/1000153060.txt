She was amazing!! I called from California and wanted to make a delivery for my mom for her birthday who was visiting family. From the very beginning she was so sweet and helpful. On the day of delivery she sent me text messages with pictures of the arrangement which was a gorgeous fall arrangement! Just what I wanted for my mom on her special day. She let me know when they were delivered and everything was perfect. My mom loved the flowers. The arrangement was gorgeous, the prices were great and the customer service was beyond amazing. I wish we had people and places like that out in California
