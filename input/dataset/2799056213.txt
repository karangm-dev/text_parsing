Went here yesterday, and well the sushi was fresh and yummy. So why two stars? Well read this as 1.5 stars and I will tell you why:1: My friend and I waited 10 minutes just to be seated when the place was only half full (around 15 people). Then we had to waive down our server in order to be served after waiting another 12 minutes of her ignoring us. 2: My friend noticed they have a bar rail special on Mondays, so we asked to get one. The waitress replied that she could not give us the Monday bar rail special because the bartender was not working that day. However the waitress told us we can order other alcoholic beverages, just not the special. How does that make any sense?!?!! If there is no bartender working how can we order other alcoholic beverages? They just wanted to make more $ by not giving out the advertised special!!3: The only other time the servers came around to our table was when it was time to pay. No water refills, no empty plates taken away.4: They only allow a 2 hour table time limit for all you can eat (why do they call it all you can eat when they kick you out after 2 hours)?!?!?
