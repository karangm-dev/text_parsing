This restaurant is very new. As a matter of fact I believe they opened two days ago. With that in mind I know it's a little early to be criticizing this restaurant.  When we got to the restaurant two girls battled over how to Seat us. Once we were seated we waited. We then continued to wait. We waited some more. My wife and I actually played a game where we would see how many waiters or waitresses would either pass by or look at us directly.  After about 10 minutes of just sitting there I told my wife if one more waiter walks by us we would leave. My wife was extremely embarrassed at this, but I had to put my foot down. Shortly after two waiters walked right past us as they talked to each other. We got up to walk out. As we walked out of the restaurant we both laughed. Not only did nobody notice we were leaving, but the greeter who had just seated us actually said thank you have a nice day. I know that this restaurant is fairly new so I won't talk about the food or drink. Oh yeah, we never got to that point. Not sure if we would ever go back to this place. It's just a weird situation to be honest. Doesn't the restaurant want to serve food and drink to its customers? Apparently not for public school (702).
