It's taken me awhile to write this. I scheduled a day to go to Sin City DIY and wrench on my truck. Showed up in the morning and was met by Tyler. Super cool dude and incredibly helpful. Spent most of the day changing out all fluids (front and rear diffs, transfer, transmission, oil & filter and flushing the cooling system), did my rotors and pads, changed the thermostat and drive belt. Did most of it myself and when I had a question, needed an extra pair of hands or just wanted to bs, Tyler was there to help. They had all the tools I needed, disposed of my old fluids, took all my trash. This place is a goldmine. I'm no mechanic and have limited knowledge but, Tyler educated me on things I knew nothing of and gave pointers to make certain tasks easier. Saved me a fortune having someone else do the work and I learned some things. I'll definitely be back to utilize their facility. My truck is running like a champ. Thank you! If you need a place to wrench on your vehicle, want to learn how to do things yourself or don't have the tools, this place is for you. Highly recommend them!
