About the worst stay of any hotel, ever. Only hotel stay I had  which was worse was a hotel with feces on the wall.   This location has slow internet, but the worst part of my stay-the snotty brats at the counter.I could not connect to the internet, instead of quickly looking it up, the snotty girl at the counter made me go through the entire connection/ fail process on my phone to show her the message which I had already explained to her, then within 10 seconds total, looked it up to tell me someone entered my room # wrong in the system. How come little power-trip girl could not have just done that to begin with?   When I checked in, 2:40pm,  I had asked about my water- Honors member here. She said, well you know check-in is not until 3pm, so we do not have any bags ready.   This was the heavier girl.   Wow, ok.  The first girl, Mrs Help Desk was a skinny Caucasian.  Now,  when I checked out,  my business partner checked in for a stay- my initial recommendation prior to my stay.  He had the exact same comments on the service there, which he shared weeks later. Bottom line, screw you people and your snotty little employees at the front desk with the attitude. There were other issues, but not going to go into it here. I recommend the Hilton Garden Inn on South Vegas BLVD instead. Night and Day difference. Have stayed there at least 20 times.
