The fact that I stood in line to place a to go order and as I finally made it up to the counter both ppl at the register walked away. I then waited for another 10 min to at no avail have many of the e.ployees look at me, but no one seemed to care to see if I had been helped. Usually I would have walked out, but at this point I decided it was best to just pick up my phone and dial a to go order in the lobby. The phone was quickly answered and my order placed and I was out in 10 min. It's a shame I had to actually call to place .t to go order inside of the IHOP because I couldn't get any service.
