First time dealing with these guys and I don't often write reviews but these guys deserve some recognition. My friend brought his Dodge van in because they did his transmission a few months earlier, and it was only going into 1st and 2nd gear. They brought it to the dealer to find out that it was the ECM/PCM computer that was bad. These guys got the van back from Chapman, and put in the PCM that I found online. Great communication and going the extra mile. Sergio and Caesar are really good, customer-oriented, professional guys and I would recommend Delta Auto to anyone.
