There are many good things about Costco and very few bad.  Let's get the bad out of the way first.  For years, Costco Tire Center was my goto for tires.  Then, the Michelin tires starting blowing up on me.  To be fair, I am hard on tires.  But blowouts are hard on vehicles, so I stopped getting tires at Costco.  I can't really think of much more bad, unless you consider they keep moving the inventory around, so you are always looking for that stuff you bought last time, because it's not where it was before.  Sometimes when you see that thing that you just gotta have, but cannot really afford it?  Well, you better bite, because it may not be there the next time.  Prices are great, but you have to buy in bulk.  This is okay for things that will keep, but stuff like bread and pastries- you better really like because you are either gonna get tired of them or they spoil.  I use a vacuum sealer for stuff I don't think will last.I like that you can get more organic stuff now.  We buy as much organic as we can afford, and Costco is good for things like Half/half and eggs.  We go through a lot of half and half.  Gas?  you bet.  Always priced great. Anyway, been going here for years and I highly recommend Costco.
