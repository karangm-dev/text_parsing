This is the reason that I give 4 stars for a good restaurant experience. What do you give a restaurant like Naked BBQ if you've given all the others 5 star ratings?This is what I have been waiting for! A great BBQ experience in Phoenix.. woo hoo!  Best of all, this is the nicest and most sincere kitchen crew in the valley. Thanks! FIVE STARS.
