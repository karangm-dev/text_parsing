Another Fox Concept success. It was pretty busy and we didn't want to die on the patio or wait 45 min so we sat in the lounge and it was perfect. Our server was Sabrina who is seriously the prettiest thing ever. We got Frito Misto app (fried calamari, shrimp and zucchini. The portion was small and we only had like three zucc. My boyfriend got the scallops which he devoured. There were five huge scallops along with corn and asparagus. I got the chicken chopped salad which was also so good. The granola is an interesting touch but was pretty tasty (was hard to imagine granola in a salad when I ordered). It was rather inexpensive ($14) and was seriously huge (so much chicken, avocado, and goat cheese) I could only eat a thirdish of it. Can't wait to come back and get it again, I know I'll be craving it!
