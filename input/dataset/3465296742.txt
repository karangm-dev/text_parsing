This place was not great. Quality of items not up to par with what I'm used to at other Savers locations. I never leave empty handed at a thrift store, and if I do, it's because I figure I've been shopping too much lately (but have something in mind I would get otherwise). This place had absolutely nothing that interested me whatsoever. I was so disappointed! I may go back today and give it another shot, but this was more full of junky items than any other thrift store I've ever been to.
