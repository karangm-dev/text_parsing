Today I used Barefoot Organic for the first time, and I couldn't be happier. Justin called 15 mins ahead of arriving, was very efficient, and did a great job cleaning my two area rugs. He  charged exactly what they quoted over the phone, and didn't try to sell me anything extra. I will definitely use them again.
