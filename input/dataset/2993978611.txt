I almost never leave reviews but I felt compelled in this case, as the former operators were significantly better. I don't know what Sgt Clean changed in their drive thru wash, but in the two times I've been here, my car comes out with significant chemical streaks down the doors and fenders. I had to hose my car off and re-wash the door panels and hatch when I got home. Definitely not worth the $15 that I paid and I never had this problem with the old line.
