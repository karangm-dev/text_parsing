Undoubtedly the rudest management in the City of Charlotte I wouldn't go there if was the only restaurant in Charlotte!!!!  I had a voucher from Liviing Social which was to expire in September 25th which I was going to use on the day but an emergency came up and I could not use it.  I called Living Social and asked what could be done they advised me to call the restaurant and ask for an extension to the following weekend which I did.  I asked for a manager and told him of my problem the answer was YOU HAVE HAD ENOUGH TIME TO USE YOUR VOUCHER GOODBYE!!!!!  There are so many fine steak houses in Charlotte that want to accommodate customers then why go to one like this.  After reading the other reviews on Living Social about the rudeness of the staff and their service much less there food I tore up the voucher why waste any more money on a 3rd class restaurant~~
