Decided to give this place a shot because my wife and I live down the street. Interesting concept of marking down what you want on the bag and then going to the register. The place was very clean and there was a guy that immediately wanted to know I needed any help with the ordering process. Everybody overall was really nice and helpful. Food took a little longer than expected but the place just opened so so big deal. Ordered a buffalo chicken, thanksgiving and caprice sandwiches. Honestly... it was not good at all. Very little meat and topping, was pretty bland but the bread was fresh and was pretty good because a good piece of bread makes the sandwich. I understand that this place just opened, but they are all over the United Staes and they have to be doing something right everywhere else. Will be back eventually but not for several months when they get there act together.
