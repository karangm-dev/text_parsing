This place is a copy cat of what they offer next door. From signage to specialty drinks to crepes. Now they even sell breakfast and meals. For a place that fit like two people you can think how fresh are their ingredients if they can make meals, crepes, bubble teas, juices, breakfasts, everything u can think of at a CHEAP price. You give that a thought. How good/fresh are these drinks/food for such a low price. The taste is not the same. If you support plagiarism and fake cheap drinks then go ahead. What you give is what you get. My experience was disgusting.
