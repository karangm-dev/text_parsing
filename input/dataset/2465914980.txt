I've been coming here for a few years, but won't be any more. The food and service only gets worse. I've had servers spill things on me and not even apologize. Most of the food is pre-cooked or made. It's basically the taco-bell equivalent of Thai food. You're better off making it yourself. And even if you were willing to stay for the mediocre food because it might be easier than cooking at home, the staff and service aren't worth it. They're rude, not accommodating, and good luck getting their attention.
