After being charged $60 for my $15 co payment I thought it was okay at first they couldn't do a refund so I would just use it up anyways with future appointments I had to get blood work done, Come to find out the dr. I had quit so they had no record of me needing blood work so I would have to make another appointment... I just called to make another appointment and they didn't call me back in 3 hours and didn't answer the phone.. I would totally recommend finding another doctor wait time is terrible and staff turnaround seems to be high.. Now I am sick having to find another doctor.. TERRIBLE
