Just moved down the road from Jewels and came here on accident after looking for another restaurant. And boy, am I glad I did! I was diagnosed with celiac disease 25 years ago and it's been amazing to watch it transform over the years. This place is by far one of the best GF restaurants I have been to. Delicious food, all gluten free, and the desserts look awesome. I will definitely have to control the amount of times I stop by so I do not gain 200lbs eating here all the time. Although I already have a breakfast date scheduled for tomorrow here. Uh oh. Highly recommend!
