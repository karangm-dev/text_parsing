Went there at 1130 on rememberence day.  Needless to say, it was dead.  Got the lunch ayce, which offered items you'd expect for an ayce lunch. They run on the traditional pencil and paper ordering system, which they will then punch into the system which will be sent to the kitchen staff. Our order was picked up quite promptly (seeing how we were the only customers there at the time, that would hopefully be the case), and the food came within a reasonable amount of time.The food was subpar; nothing really stuck out.  The salmon quality was poor, it looked slightly old, as if they were taken from yesterday's supply. The quirks I look for in every ayce came out negative:- For the salmon rose, they use one piece instead of two like other ayce restaurants with higher ratings+  They served cream cheese wontons during lunch. That was probably me and my girlfriend's saving grace- The music was horrendous.  We were there for little less than 50 minutes, and we heard Christian country music, the Friends theme song, country rap, Rihanna Christmas music, and others of that effect+  I enjoyed their handrolls. Seaweed was crispy and they had a good filling to rice ratio.- Service was mediocre/bad.  They were able to keep our drink orders up, but overall looked grumpy. All in all, a run of the mill ayce with REALLY BAD MUSIC. Would not go again.
