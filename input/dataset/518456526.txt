This is absolutely the BEST pool company in Phoenix. Hands down. They are honest, which we all know is a huge plus, they do exceptional work, and they are genuinely just a great group of people. They fixed our swamp of a pool, I kid you not. It looked like something on T.V. The pool motor was only working at partial capacity, and we tried to keep it going , but needed help. When I started looking I thought it would be easy, but a lot of places just offered cleaning services. I then saw Complete Pool Care online, and they had good reviews, had been in business since the 80's, and that says a lot right there. They were the first company and only company I ended up calling. They aren't like used car salesmen, and they didn't push. They educated us thru the entire process, and went out of their way if question or worries came up.I will ALWAYS use them and have recommended them to others is someone asks. I feel bad for people if they choose the wrong company, because of the prices, or the headaches that come with the problems. I know there are some quality pool places in Phoenix. But I seriously doubt that they are as good as and could no way be better than Complete Pool Care. Please take my word on this. I am just lke all of you reading, Looking. When it comes to any pool service, or maintenance or anything, no need to look further. Sorry such a long review, but they are worth it.. Just call them and see for yourself.Thanks!! 5 stars all the way!
