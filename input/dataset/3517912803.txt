I wanted to respond to Aaron's review. That's because I'm likely the individual the server was sitting with. Just to clarify, that was at my request. I'm on my own these days, and on most evenings my company is the latest issue of Sports Illustrated. But at this particular Fleming's, where I generally dine once each week and am a Magnum member) I've become friendly with most of the people that work there. And on this particular evening, I asked the server to join me. Had this prevented her from being attentive to your party (which was not the case, as you noted), you'd have a legitimate complaint. As that wasn't the case, there was no lack of professionalism whatsoever. Fact is, while I really enjoy all the elements (food, service, ambience) at this Fleming's, it's the personal treatment that keeps me coming back. I thought this needed to be said.
