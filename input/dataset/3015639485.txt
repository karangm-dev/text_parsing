We were back just a couple of weeks ago to see Daniel Tosh's great show at the Mirage. (You have to check out the restaurant Stack at The Mirage!!!) Ok back to the review. After hiking at Red Rock Canyon we stopped in to get some jeans and shirts for hubby. Our fav sales guy, Tim, has moved to a different Men's Wearhouse location but we still had outstanding service from Abraham and Eddie. Abraham went out of his way to help find the right style & size jeans we were looking for and Eddie found some great casual shoes. Thank you guys!! :)
