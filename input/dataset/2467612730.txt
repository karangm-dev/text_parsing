We have always been a fan of this Indian restaurant located inside the Rio All Suites Hotel and Casino. This changed tonight. Even though we arrived at 10:15, a full 45 minutes before the posted 11:00pm closing time, we were denied seating. We were told the chef went home early. We went out of our way to patronize this small business. It's unfortunate that the chain restaurants are taking over, but it's not hard to see why. They may not provide premium offerings, but they do provide consistency. You can walk in to a chain restaurant five minutes before closing and get served. Hopefully the owner of this restaurant will realize that you gain customers one at a time and lose them one at a time. They wasted my time and disrespected me as a customer and have lost my business.
