I am a huge Marvel fan & I love everything about the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I was excited to go to this place when I went to Vegas because, cmon... it's MARVEL! I love the decorations around this place, but the main thing is the tour. I had a great experience because the tour guide (forgot his name) was very interactive and all the props were amazing, it felt like at the moment, I was actually part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe :). This is a great place to go if you're a fan of Marvel & the MCU. If I could give more than 5 stars.. lol
