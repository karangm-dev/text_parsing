This place is terrible they make u wait for close to an hour and think it's ok They have several nail technicians like 2 of them can do designs seriously ????This place is rude crude and obnoxious and make it like your the problem when u voice your opinion the length of time is ridiculousI wouldn't recommend this place to anyone by far the worst nail shop I've ever been to
