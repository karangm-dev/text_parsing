I thought I would add to my first review, since it has been awhile. This is still my go-to for vegetarian indian food. I have to admit that I am a creature of habit and I pretty much always have the Paneer Korma when I go, but the other dishes are great too, like the okra and the potatoes and spinach. Their Samosas are really good and flavourful and cheap! Like I mentioned in my previous review of this place, the naan is really good as well. I have just tried their desserts for my first time, and they are excellent.The decor is cute and the service was good the couple of times I ate in, although I usually order take-out. The prices are great and the food is super filling.The parking lot can be a bit of a hassle, but generally it is easy to find parking. I recommend calling in your order if it is take-out, so you don't have to wait while they prepare it.
