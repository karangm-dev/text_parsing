This Blimpie location is the best I've experienced. For the past 17 years I have grown to love this place. The other locations I've checked out have been overshadowed by the service and quality of this one. I will continue to make quick lunch trips from time to time. The same lunch staff seems like they have been here forever. Truly a staple at Tatum and Shea!
