I recently moved from Phoenix to Raleigh, NC and I MISS MY DRS OFFICE!!!!!!  This is the most wonderful place to go. You can get ALL of your needs met. They have a Dr and PA's that specialize in hormone and endocrinology issues plus you can go to a GYN and also a PA specializing in mental health issues. It's all here. No more 2, 3 or 4 different places. Dr Mary Montes and her assistant Chelsea are phenomenal. You get a LIVE PERSON when you call! People are NICE! They CARE. They CALL YOU BACK! The best. I would give this office 10 stars if I could.
