We had good food and great service at the Fusion Sushi in Kensington so we came here expecting the same. Big mistake! The food was okay. The service was not good at all. They seemed extremely confused by my allergies (simply asked for nothing to have sesame on it). The worst part of all was that the restaurant smelled so bad!!! We were seated in the back portion of the restaurant towards the bar and I'm really not sure if that was the washroom or the kitchen but either way it made the meal absolutely unpleasant. We'll probably be back at Fusion- but not this location.
