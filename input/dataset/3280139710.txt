**updated 4/27/14** The first time I came here I decided to sign up for a monthly membership.  It took OVER an hour to get this done.  Not once did they apologize for making me stand there while they figured out how to use their computers. 2 days later they called me numerous times,  leaving messages for me to call back because they had the SOMEONE ELSE's credit card on my account.  (2 red flags). A few days ago I decided to call to make an appointment for a shellac manicure.  First time I got hung up on,  then I called right back and they were closed.  After calling numerous times the following day (no one would answer the phone), I made the appointment for the next day. I got to the appointment 7 minutes late and they informed me that due to that, I would be forced to get a regular manicure and not shellac.  I informed her that I would like to cancel my membership.  Just like that she said "ok,  your membership is cancelled". I sure felt like a valued customer.  This is the worst run nail salon I have been to, and it was a mistake to sign up for the membership.  Also the pedicure benches are extremely uncomfortable...would never in a million years recommend this place to anyone.
