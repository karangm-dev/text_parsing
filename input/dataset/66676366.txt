Buyer beware -  I went to purchase flowers from the 70% off rack - the entire isle states 70% off, when it came time to check out, they were full price.  Clerk said that that specific color isn't clearances out, but the rest were...... interesting they are located in the CLEARANCE aisle with a sign that says 70% off.  I also bought material, regular priced material, bolt DID NOT INDICATE CLEARANCE on the material.  I wanted to use a coupon on the item, " Sorry Ma'am, that material is on clearance."   No it's full price, no where did it indicate it was on clearance.   Poor sales representation JoAnn Fabrics and Gifts.
