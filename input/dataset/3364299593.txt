Sooooo..... Fight night. There we are. Every single fight. And lo and behold, KIDS are allowed at the bar until God-knows-when. Seriously. Children. In a bar. They were permitted to enter under "parental supervision" however, NO PARENTS to be found. The staff doesn't seem to mind. IT'S A COMPLETE BUZZ KILL. Also, total lack of seating for the absolutely expected crowd of games/fights/whatever is going on. Ridiculous. My point is...... STOP ADMITTING CHILDREN. This is NOT a family environment.
