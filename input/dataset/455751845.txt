Great dogs, great drinks, great people! We have stopped by and grabbed something to eat many times. We have also hired them to cater a company picnic. Have always been very accommodating. They have a selection of:Jumbo Dogs,Mini Dogs,Spicy Dogs,Polish Sausagesand Brawts!All of it are great! They are located in the parking lot at Home Depot. There are two benches there if you choose to eat there. Many customers end up eating there while talking to the workers. Had one today, and will continue to be a regular customer.
