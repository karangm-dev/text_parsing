Thank you Jon S.  You recommended the perfect drink and helped me find a delicious menu item for my first visit. I appreciate the extensive knowledge about the menu that you were able to share. I didn't like my first choice and you encouraged me to try again. You are absolutely an asset to the company. Thank you again.
