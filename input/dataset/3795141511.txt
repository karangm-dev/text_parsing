Dined with my husband and 2 kids on Saturday 2/20 evening  8pm. No line...that should  have been a tell tale sign.Gourmet dinner  for 2 Adults &  2 kids $177.. yes... kids are charged regular price. We dined at Bacchanal the previous  night. So I  have  something to base my review  on. Since we were already there we decided to stay and eat. My 8yr old son only ate 4 slices of pizza : (These are the items  I tried:beef wellington - it was dry..the Kobe sirloin - tough and tasteless Ribeye- chewy Clams (clam bake) there were more veggies in it than clams - i think they should  just prepared it with butter and  white winePork bun- blahChocolate  eclair was dry  Creme  brulee- texture was a bit thick almost like pudding.  The burned sugar on top did crack when you break into it.. probably  sat out too longFruit - watermelon  was dried and shriveled  up. I cant believe they would  still serve it. Highlights !!!Crablegs - ask the staff behind the counter to steam  them, yum!Lamb- very good , not gameyBroccolini & mashed  potatoes - excellent Bowtie  pasta with cream sauce  and  sun dried tomatoes - my favorite dish herePizzas - cant go wrong Poke & sushi - fresh Pesto mash- goodDesserts- tiramisu, cheesecakeI was very disappointed that there were no oysters, the charcuterie  platter pales in comparison to  Bacchanal's . The offerings were very limited and did not seem "gourmet " as dinner was described.    Our server was an older lady...she was very slow and forgot  to refill our  drinks several  times.  I didn't even want to  bother asking for coffee with dessert. My husband  felt we were troubling her too much if we had asked. The last time  I  dined here was about 5 years ago and it seems that it hasn't  changed  much.
