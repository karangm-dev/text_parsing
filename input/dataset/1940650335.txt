My story sums up my review. Me and four other friends decided to go here for a quick bite and drink. The restaurant was busy. We were seated quickly (outside, on the balcony), which started out as a good sign. However, after our waiter initially took our orders (well, the drinks at least) he took another table's order around us on the balcony and gave them their drinks first. Okay, mistake. We got ours soon after, placed our oder for food, and that came relatively quick (but not from our waiter). We waited outside for over 25 minutes wondering if our waiter was going to come back. He was cleaning tables around us, attending the other guests, but not once came back to us (we signalled and called). Not only are we dying from the heat, but we were finished and ready for the bill. I had to go inside, finder someone who looked in charge (there was nobody, not even at the greeting desk) until finally I got someone to send our waiter back. Once he came, we asked for the bill. Another 17 minutes passed by, and we hadn't seen him once (the other guests at this point went inside because they were too hot). Finally, we all got up, walked back in the restaurant, and a few minutes later he gave us the bills and took off. Probably the worst service of a restaurant in that mall.Summary: Food was okay, nothing that sets it apart from the competition. The price is also much on the higher side for okay quality sushi. Not my go-to place, although recreational design was nice (also pre-booking and ordering food with the tablets is nice). Service was just plain horrible (read the story above for more on that). Remember (for some weird reason) they DON'T accept debit.
