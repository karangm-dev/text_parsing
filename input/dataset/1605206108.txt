I went yesterday and even though the food prices are ridiculous, the bagels were great. Went back today to get some bagels for Home. Completely different Bagel, store bought not made in house. Reminded me of a grocery store bagel. Who does that?? Real classy to offer your customers such an inferior product. By the way, yesterday when I went for breakfast they only had plain and poppy. Was told the baker can't keep up. Never will go back again. This place was not ready to open, and now they have lost me, and it looks like a bunch of others from ever going back.
