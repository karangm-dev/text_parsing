HD quoted me a discounted rate for 10 hours of service, but when I checked my credit card statement I saw that he charged me full price. When I called him he said that my company wasn't giving him enough business, so he charged me full price. (I had used his service for 2 trips totaling nearly 20 hrs of service in two months!)Congratulations Starr Limousine, you took my money but you lost my business.
