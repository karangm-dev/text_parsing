I was a little nervous trying out a new location, but found myself pleasantly surprised! It's clear corporate brought in experienced employees from nearby stores to get this one off the ground on the right foot. I work up the street and visit once or twice a week to get out of the office. The staff is friendly and my order is accurate and speedy. On a recent visit, the lady ahead of me was trying to buy a bunch of gift cards in the drive-thru (wtf?), and the barista comped my whole order in apology for the wait. Solid customer service. My only complaint is that because the plaza is still fairly new, some of the contractors from nearby businesses have a habit of taking a smoke break behind Starbucks (along the drive-thru). So if you dislike smoke, roll your window up in a hurry as you pull around ;)
