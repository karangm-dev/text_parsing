Was able to get in for a last minute gender check and Terry was FABULOUS! She talked me through the whole ultrasound and revealed we are having a baby girl! This is less expensive than other gender checks ($45 vs $55 for base and the $45 included a 3D look, other places charge an extra $20 for that service) and there are a few trade off's (the room its self is not as nice as I have seen at other places and you don't get to pick your background music for the video...but if those things are not as important to you (they aren't to me) then this is your place!!
