I love my dog more than I love most people, as any dog lover can relate. Her name is Roxy and she is a Maltese/Shih Tzu. We took her in to get groomed and she was cut on her paw. Why her paw was cut makes NO sense since we PAY EXTRA to have her nails grinded not cut. Luckily my gf picked her up and not me because I would have absolutely lost it on these people and would have went for a paw for paw type revenge. But I have settled down slightly and would never do that to a person, hopefully. The guy made a mistake and sh*t happens but when my girl goes to pick up the dog, there was this blonde woman (who was a B to us on multiple occasions) and she completely acted like it was no big deal. The dogs paw and my gf were covered in blood. It was just gushing everywhere. Thankfully there was an old shirt in the car to wrap her paw with as she was rushed to the vet to have her tiny paw cauterized in two spots since they cut her twice. Cost us $80 at the Vet. I will never return to this Petsmart or any Petsmart ever again out of mere principle. Thanks for reading my review. BEWARE OF PETSMART!
