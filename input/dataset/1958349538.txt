Love this nail salon! Unlike others I have been to they talk to you in a friendly manner, they let you pick your pedicure from a list of prices ranging from 20 to 30. You have the option of hot stone foot and leg massage, paraffin dip, and different scrubs. They take their time doing your pedicure. Unlike other places where you wait an eternity and then the service takes 20 minutes. The nail techs in this shop are awesome. Will continue to go back every week.
