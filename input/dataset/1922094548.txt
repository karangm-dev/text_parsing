Canteen is one of my all time favorites in Madison! I am a fan of their margaritas and flavorful tacos! One of my favorite tacos is the Calabacitas - a vegetarian taco! It is not common to find such a tasty vegetarian option at a taco restaurant. Additionally, the small space and vibrant decor allow for an intimate and enjoyable dining experience.
