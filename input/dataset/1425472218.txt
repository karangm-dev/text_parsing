Absolutely fantastic place. Looks like an Italian corner store from the outside but be sure that wonders will be waiting for you when you step inside this magical gem. Aside from offering abundance of Italian delicacies that range from pasta to sauces, oils, and sweets this place has one unique feature that makes it a must visit. The Italian subs made to order! Go pick up your bread, and head over to the counter! They'll load up layers of delicious cured meats and cheeses and you can finish it up with tomatoes Italian hot peppers and some olive oil. My absolute go to spot in the neighbourhood for lunch!
