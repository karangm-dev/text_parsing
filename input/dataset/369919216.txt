This business is absolute RIPOFF. If here was 0 stars that's what it would have been. I have been a customer for a year and as my warranty was going to expire I received a call to renew- as I did. Well.....my AC decides to blow hot air (it's dead summer July with115 days) and a tech comes out 3 days later (we know it can get busy in the summer time so we understand) and we are told it's low on free on....we paid for free on as well the $60 it was taken care of, 3 wks later same problem....now it takes another 2 days before a tech can come out and the problem now is that it's leaking.....who ever added the free on didn't catch the leak....so now that is taken care of and patched up......4 wks later same problem- blowing hot air......AGAIN! No tech available for 4 days not until Saturday.....NOW IM FURIOUS, what kind of people are you sending out where the problem is NEVER SOLVED I have children and it's dead summer. A tech finally comes out Saturday morning and replies...."I know the problem it's LEAKING but I don't have time to fix it today because it will take too long and it's MY Saturday and I'm tired!" Are you freaking kidding me!!!! Long story short....we had no AC for 7 days. Spoke to both National Home Warranty as well as who they were contracted with, it was a run around to speak to any managers let alone even get their contacts. This place is TERRIBLE. DO NOT USE THEM AS YOUR HOME WARRANTY. I wish I would have seen these reviews prior but I will tell you that what these people are saying is very accurate because it has happened to me. A wise man says its best to learn from someone else's mistake then make that mistake yourself.
