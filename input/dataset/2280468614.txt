New England clam chowder was good.  Oysters Rockefeller average with tiny tiny oysters.Also, had the Jambalaya.  Chicken tasted processed.  Sausage was undercooked.  Shrimp was good.  Sauce didn't taste fresh.Very overpriced especially since you have to listen to the casino noise.Try the Cafe Coronado instead if you really need to eat at South Point.
