I didn't even walk in the door and I received terrible customer service. I decided to call and ask about the ingredients (specifically the use of butter) and possibly some substitutions because my husband and I don't consume any animal products whatsoever, but the man who answered told me he would "be right back" and then hung up the phone on me.I won't bother with this place when they refuse to even acknowledge my simple question over the phone.
