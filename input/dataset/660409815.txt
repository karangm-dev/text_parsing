Decided to try something new and was extremely disappointed. We ordered the hummus for an appetizer and it was only mediocre. I ordered the chicken sandwich and it just wasn't quite as well throughout out as it should have been. The roll was too thick so it overpowered the other ingredients. Additionally it was missing something...needs avocado and/or bacon. My date ordered the mac-and-cheese with chicken and it was dry with little chicken; she was extremely disappointed. I had at least hopped for some good craft beer but nothing outside of the more mainstream "craft" brews. We won't be back.
