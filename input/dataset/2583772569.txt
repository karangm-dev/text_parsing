A fantastic show that shows off real local (and some out of towners) talent. Really fun and high energy celebration of all the things that make the las Vegas burlesque community great. It is highly inclusive and the performers really interact with the audience. This is not an over produced strip show, this is real, which in my opinion is way better!
