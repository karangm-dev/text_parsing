I purchased a print from a catalogue that was roughly $60 and was told it would be delivered from their supplier in no more than two weeks. It has now been on the verge of two months and have been calling this place every week to get more information on where my print is. I call and ask the owner to call me back, and she never does. Im pissed, but I'm just left to assume she is busy dealing with other irate customers who have already paid and are waiting extraordinarily long for their prints or frames. The customer service here is zilch to none. Very quick to take your money, and slow to call you back when it takes 4 times longer than you expect to get what you have already paid for. NOT ONLY would I never recommend this place to anyone, but would call this place a fraud, and verge on calling the authorities on them. I don't know why this place is still in business, and hope that it doesnt last much longer.
