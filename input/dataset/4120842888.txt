Really tasty local bistro with lots of healthy options! I got the Fall Leaves salad as I love roasted butternut squash and beets. My friend got a Berry Avocado quinoa bowl with chicken added. Huge portions, fresh and delicious. We got there at 11:15am on a Friday afternoon and 15 minutes later the place was packed. Next time I visit, would like to try out one of the grilled cheese sandwiches and some french fries.
