The location and layout was great.  Bar service was spot on.  I had the Father's Day special it was great (cheesesteak sandwich combo).We came back month later, ordered the trash nachos... no! Never again. ... they were smush, (paper thin chips? Really) the cheese was horrible and I had to ask for extra jalape√±os.... it was supposed to be pulled pork not cut meat chunks. .. very disappointed.. I was gonna send it back but I was getting my drink on anyway, so I didn't care at that moment...
