This is the best Crepe Bar in town! Great savory and sweet crepe options.  My personal favorite and recommendation is the Chorizo Buritto Crepe.  Staff is helpful and friendly. Sometimes they bring you a small sliver of a pastry to try. Coffee is ok but there teas are great. Expect a long wait time on weekends.  During the week it's nice ans quiet. Definitely recommend this place.
