My family wanted to try this place so I went along even though I really wanted Italian food. We walked in and I was instantly pleased-dim, romantic lighting accompanied with a beautiful bar, outside patio, and really comfy booths. I even noticed a private dining room in the corner for events. To make a long story short, I got my Italian fix-I ordered Jene's penne and it was so delicious! It was covered in a white Bianca sauce which had a bacon aftertaste, so yummy. I tasted my family's plates which were more geared towards the Lebanese culture-kifta kabob, chicken skewers, tikka, tabbouleh, hummus, and fettush. All were fabulous!I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who asked about Lebanese food. If you have the pleasure to meet the owner because he is very sweet and hospitable (I forgot to catch his name!
