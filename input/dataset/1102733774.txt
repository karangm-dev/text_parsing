This is a great Italian deli.  Everyone here was so nice and very helpful.  A very large menu and bagel and dessert selection.  My wife ordered some bagels for her workdays and some cream cheese.  They have 7 different cream cheese selections. The bagels are soft and have lots of flavor.  We got green olive and herb cream cheese.  Both were outstanding. We also ordered lunch.  She ordered the two meat sandwich with Hebrew National salami and bologna.  Wow we're those two meats good.  We already love the hot dogs, the salami and bologna are just as good.  I ordered the Reuben with corned beef and pastrami.  Very crispy buttery bread, good sauerkraut, and 1000 island dressing.  Best rueben I have had in Vegas so far.  I will be back for it again. The dessert case had a lot to choose from.  We got a black and white cookie, a homemade Twinkie and some other pastries.  All were really good. I would recommend this deli to anyone.  We will be back soon.
