After eating here, I almost wanted to warn people waiting in line to just walk away. Seriously? $40 per person during the weekends for dinner at this uninspiring buffet is a joke. Sure, they have prime rib, NY Steak, crab legs and shrimp, but everything else was mediocre at best. The room itself is very uninspiring - my college dining commons looked nicer. The staff were nice enough, but service was slow and the waitress forgot to bring our drink order a few times. It's just a very average buffet that is charging ridiculous prices. For the money, I'd rather go to Wicked Spoon at Cosmo, Cravings buffet at the Mirage, or the Buffet at Aria or Bellagio. The only thing this place has going for it is that its MyVegas redemption has less restrictions than the other MGM Resort buffets....
