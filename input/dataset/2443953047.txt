We went there for dinner the other night, being in Vegas for the weekend.  We had driven by a couple of times, and had it pointed out during the "Haunted Vegas" tour a couple years ago.Putting it simply; the food was incredible!  Being from NY, I am an Italian food snob, and this was some of the best I have ever had.  I had the veal scallopini, my wife had the chicken marsala and we were in heaven!  Then, we had the canolis for dessert!!!The service was fantastic as well.  The place was pretty busy, but service was quick and friendly and the atmosphere was a lot of fun.  This is definitely a place we will visit again next time we are in Vegas.
