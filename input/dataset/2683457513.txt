Super good Thai food !! Once you come here you'll never go to Pei Wei again ! Smells DELISH upon walking in , friendly service , clean modern atmosphere .. Decent prices , food is fresh and Taste amazing ! We had the Chicken pad Tai , Mu Yang (the guy Fieri item ) and a couple drinks , highly recommend the leeche martini. Can't wait to come back to try something new :)
