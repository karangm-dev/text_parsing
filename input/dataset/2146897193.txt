Went into Midas the other day to get new brake pads. I had purchased a Groupon and was advised by midas personnel to hold off on redeeming it until they verified that I needed to replace them. It turned out I did need new brake pads and they changed them in a timely manner. Very happy with the service I received and will definitely be taking my car to them for other car maintenances.
