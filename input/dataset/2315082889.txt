It was a last minute decision to see this show. We purchased tickets and I had my doubts. I am not a huge fan but I do love her acting so I went. The show blew me away! J.Lo is an amazing performer. She danced from start to finish. Just as the show is titled she gives it all she has! It's a must see in my opinion. You will not be disappointed! Side note...s the staff is not particularly friendly. That is the only down fall.
