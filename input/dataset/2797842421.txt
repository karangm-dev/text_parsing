Although I was upset to see my record store / cafe gone I did enjoy the new establishment. We were here for the happy hour and were able to taste several appetizers. The Mac & Cheese balls, truffle fries and chicken nachos. Everything was infused with great flavours. Barry our waiter was fantastic. Although, all the staff was very attentive to all tables and we saw several staff at our table. When I return to Vegas I will be back!
