Very large menu selection, and very reasonable prices, and the outside patio is nice.  I'm very picky about wanting my eggs well done, and bacon soft and greasy - and I don't always get it this way, but today the waitress was a champ!  And it was nice to be able to get fries rather than their fried potato chunks.I only wish the food stayed warmer longer while out on the patio.
