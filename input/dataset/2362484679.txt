This hotel or should I say "HOE MOE TEL" should be shut down for good. It is the worst place I have ever stayed and I settled for this because of a last minute need to get to Vegas! I was kept up all night with loud guest in the hallway and pounding on the doors. After getting up to see what was going on I saw half dressed females.. this hotel was booked online and we drove around looking for the location for several minutes after coming to a dead end, using map quest directions..NO HOT Water, no face towels, light from hallway shining through door frame all night, freeway noises all night long.. Continental breakfast is a joke as well it's a dump period....beware......Just saying...
