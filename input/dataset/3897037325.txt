I was really disappointed with the service over the phone with Rainbow.  It was so horrible in fact, I don't think I will ever go here.  First of all,  the guy seemed really frantic and overwhelmed.  He then told me the book for my class, which our professor specifically directed for us to buy from Rainbow, was out of stock and would not be reordered.  (Upside Down by Galeano) I then tried to ask a follow up question, and was then hung up on.   Long story short don't shop at Rainbow.
