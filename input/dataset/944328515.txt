Have been renting yard equipment and trailers here for 14 years. The staff is always friendly. The pickup and drop off parking is kind of a mess. We rented high top bar tables and linen for a party for the first time this weekend. My wife requested shorter linens. We got long linen that was hanging on the ground. We did not want to damage anything so never even pulled out all but the one. Asked for a refund but the office staff declined. The guys at the drop off were super nice and apologized about it. Too bad, guess we will not be back.
