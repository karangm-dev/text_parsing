New favorite spot close to home! Clean, friendly staff, and the food was delish! I tried the chicken shawarma pita with garlic sauce and it was amazing! Also, some of the best French fries I've ever had which was an unexpected bonus. My son had their chicken strips which were just okay but only patrons of unevolved palates (a.k.a toddlers) would order something like that at a tasty pita joint anyways so, zero deductions. Jalape√±o cilantro hummus was on point! Oh and they serve beer and wine which is most definitely a plus, amiriite?? Go here.
