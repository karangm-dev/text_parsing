Went to wedding dinner reception here on Saturday, June 10, 2017 and I expected a lot more from this place, as I've heard good things (a few years back. Probably has changed since then). Venue itself is really nice, cocktail area had a nice vibe and different seating areas. The hall/dinner area had high ceilings and open feel. What lacked and was a big disappointment was the quality of food and service. Food was average and nothing special. Service was terrible as food and drinks were taken away when we weren't finished eating and/or drinking. Some servers were unpleasant, lazy and awkward to say the least. Would not recommend this place especially for the price per plate that you're paying for!
