ICA is a really nice, well-maintained retail store and range. It's staffed with professional gun experts that can answer any question you might have about firearms. They also have a nice outdoor range for everything outdoors! ICA is affordable and sometimes you can find a Groupon for a bargain! It's a great place to go target shoot on your lunch break, date night, or just for fun. They have a nice selection of guns and accessories and they even offer reasonably priced memberships for the indoor and outdoor ranges.. for the price you pay at any range for a couple hours/day, you might as well get a membership here and practice every week!
