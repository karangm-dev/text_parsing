The guy who took my order was really rude. It was my first time going there so I guess I didn't order quick enough or I wasn't an expert in whatever I was ordering. I wanted a mixed berry smoothie at first and the guy had the nerve to roll his eyes in my face and tell me he just didn't have yogurt or whatever to make it. Then I was like ok, I want a caramel macchiato. He mumbled something under his breath, so thinking that he couldn't make it, I started to say "ok then I'll have something else." He bit back with "NO! Do you want iced or heated?!" I said iced. I also wanted a bagel; I looked him straight in the eyes and ordered my bagel while he was gossiping with someone else and he never gave me my bagel xS, never even processed that I had ordered something else. Not going back there again.
