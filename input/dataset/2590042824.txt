My calamari was so so. My issue is with the professionalism of the staff.  When my change was brought to me the waitress said it is a dollar short because they ran out of change. She didn't say "when I get the change I will bring it to you", or "do you have a dollar and I will trade you a five?" She took it upon herself to keep it. I was busy talking to friends so until I counted my change did we understand what she was telling us.  My friend said,"did I just hear what I thought I heard"?The money is not the issue, it is the way it was handled and the attitude of matter of fact.This had nothing to do with a tip since they already had added 20%. Truthfully I usually give 25%.
