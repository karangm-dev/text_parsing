We've been VERY desperate for good Mexican food ever since Mas Amigos/Don Juan's closed.  Just learned about El Patio a couple of weeks ago, and we were eager to try it in the hopes that finally there might be a place where we would be excited about the Mexican food. Because I am a native Texan, this is a lot more important to me than to most in this area.Alas. Suffice it to say that, not only did I not finish my cheese enchiladas (I did finish the taco), I didn't even bother to take the considerable leftovers home with me. Not very tasty. The same was true of the guacamole as well as the "spicy" salsa that they bring out only to those who request it (it was NOT very spicy). Just not a lot of taste anywhere on the table. WHY, O WHY  did the new proprietor of Mas Amigos/Don Juan's run it into the ground?One positive thing I can say is that, unlike nearly every Mexican restaurant we've visited, this one did NOT have a television, and to us that's a very good thing.I also should say that the wait staff were very pleasant and helpful. Kudos to them.
