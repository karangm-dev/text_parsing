Facilities here were decent, no real problem w/ staff and everyone seemed genuinely nice. My biggest gripe was the mixing of low and high-functioning patients. I feel that my recovery was stunted by the unpredictable and unsettling environment the low-functioning patients promoted. My doctor here, William Bauer, was pretty nice yet very to-the-point. A bit of an abrasive bedside manner, if you ask me.I personally feel there are better facilities in the area. Go here only as a true last resort.
