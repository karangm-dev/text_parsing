This place is so cool. We stayed at the hotel and had most of our meals at the gold spike. My favorite waitress is Angelina. She is so friendly and attentive. The food was cooked perfect every time. The back yard is a grate place for adults in body but kids at heart. It was a little loud but that is to be expected at a bar. Love it.
