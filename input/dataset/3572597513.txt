Just had an amazing dinner at the bar....John was spectacular!!  Great recommendations and great service!  The food was amazing (sliders, corn dogs and the perogi pizza).  The drinks were perfect and arrived just in time.   Absolutely one of the best spots in town!   This is definitely on my list of places that I would visit with guests from out of town.
