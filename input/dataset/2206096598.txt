Please eat here. Just do it. It's amazing. It's delicious. It's sex in your mouth... All the sex. If you're a food nerd that likes food porn and taking sexy instagram pictures of your food - go here and order something. Then try not to shove it in your face hole before you remember to whip out your phone and snap a picture. Then you can tweet your half-eaten burrito photo to your friends who won't understand why it's so good because they're looking at your teeth marks in a half-eaten burrito. The owner's mom is the cook I think - sweetest lady ever. Whoever is cooking is a genius - an artist. I'm going to go back a hundred times. One of the best burritos I've ever had. It's next to a Hungry Howie's in an invisible old tiny strip mall. It belongs somewhere posh and fancy going by the quality of the food. I'm glad it's not somewhere posh and fancy. I don't like getting burrito and guacamole and salsa all over my nice shirts...
