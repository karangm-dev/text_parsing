First of all, the woman at the front desk was not friendly to us when we checked in, which was off-putting. The pool was also closed for the duration of our stay. When we get to our room, it doesn't have a jacuzzi as we had booked. That was all my girlfriend had wanted and I literally made sure on the phone 3 times that our room was to have one, as that guarantee was the only reason we paid an extra 80 dollars per night for this hotel and not for a cheaper hotel that had rooms without a jacuzzi included. Our reservation confirmation even noted to make sure we have a room with a jacuzzi tub. We called the front desk and explained and they said that they had no control over the booking as it is through a centralized booking center. They were barely even apologetic about it, and the lady said "well what exactly do you want us to do about it?" Um, I don't know what I want you you do about it but all I know is that we were given a guarantee and it wasn't fulfilled. AND not only was there no jacuzz as promised; there was also no bath tub whatsoever in this room. Just a shower with grab-bars. Well that's great. So they switch us to a room that at least has a normal bathtub, but now we must settle for two queen beds as opposed to the one king we had booked. Very frustrating. This incident aside, the hotel was comfortable and clean and the beds were comfortable, but overall was nothing special. Not worth the price at all. Will not be coming back and I do not recommend this place to anyone.
