Haven't had Cinnabon since I moved to Vegas so I was very excited to finally get a classic roll to eat as well as a box of six to take home. I ended up being quite disappointed with the roll. The icing was really yummy and the flavor was good overall, but it was either not fresh or made well. The bun itself had a dry doughy/papery texture and was just unappetizing to eat. I could've gotten cheaper and better cinnamon rolls at an average supermarket. Hopefully the box of cinnamon buns that I got won't be too bad when I heat them up and eat them at home. This location is not up to par with other Cinnabons and it was such a huge disappointment for me considering how long I've been craving Cinnabon. This definitely won't be on my list of future eats. ):
