The best airline by far! My husband and I flew Virgin America for the first time. This airline makes flying fun and comfortable! Everyone gets a TV with several channels. The pilots and stewardess are upbeat and seem to enjoy their job. My husband and I were able to get on a earlier flight with no problem or fee. This company is doing everything right and we will fly with them for future flights! Excellent job Virgin America! :)
