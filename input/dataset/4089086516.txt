I just ordered delivery from O Sushi through justeat.com. I ordered a wakame salad and three different rolls. They are all much bigger than expected and really fresh. The delivery took a little longer than I would have thought (about an hour and I live about 4 blocks away) but I assume they are really busy. I will definitely go in to eat soon!
