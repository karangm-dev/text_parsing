I have been coming here for a year in a half now and I will keep coming as long as Brandi is here. She is amazing at her craft, my hair is always the way I want it to look when I walk out. No matter what I throw at her. She also had done my daughter's hair and again perfect. She listens to what her customers say and better yet is not afraid to provide feedback and when necessary her opinion on hair choice. I love a stylist that will tell me when something I want may not work for me. Brandi is from California and is the best hair stylist I have ever had, her prices are reasonable and more than that she's not just my hair stylist, she's my friend. I go to her for my hair, my girls hair, and even my mom's hair. She's thourough and always friendly and she will make sure you leave happy and satisfied.
