Their food is great but their front door staff & waiters suck. Totties has forgotten the fact there are many other very good Asian fusion cuisine spots in scottsdale & Phoenix these days. They can't afford to continue to survive off the vapors of previous success. I predict they'll be out of business within a year due to this horrible service. People won't stand for it.
