AZCAM is a medical center on my list of clinics I go to for treatment. Dr Grout is thorough, knowledgeable, caring, and finds answers to help her patients get better. I find her staff to be nothing less than a group of caring professionals who maintain positive patient care with high quality standards. The care you receive at AZCAM will be tailored to your individual healthcare needs. Truly supportive to get you feeling better.  Thank you for helping me see the light at the end of the tunnel and supporting us through this long journey.
