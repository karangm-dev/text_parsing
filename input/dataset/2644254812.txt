I am so bummed ... I ordered off here based off of the reviews. I did a to-go order and did the vegetable fried rice , Kung Pao Chicken , and Mongolian beef . The chicken was so rubbery it was not even edible , the beef had some flavor and some piece were ok but others were rubbery . The fried rice was blah . $40 and honestly Panda Express would have been cheaper and better . So sad . The one star is for how awesome they packed the food , it was double wrapped !!
