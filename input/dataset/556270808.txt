This is an AMAZING organization. There are only a few people on staff here and the entire shelter is mainly run off of volunteer support. It is a non-profit. I love that it is no kill and the dog adoption counselors try their best to make sure families are adopting dogs that fit with the families' personality, rather than just getting animals out the door. They really care for the animals and want to make sure they are placed well. I've seen some reviews on here that complain about front desk reception or whatnot and please know that when you visit, 99% of the time you'll be helped by a volunteer. I've NEVER had a bad experience. I've found the volunteers to be the most passionate and empathetic people working at any organization around. They all really care about the animals, make sure the dogs get off-site for hikes, have big, clean, kennel space, and they are attentive to walk-in visitors.
