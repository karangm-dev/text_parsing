Rude service. I was not satisfied with some products I purchased there, and when I went to return them, the guy at the counter didn't care to hear my concerns. He just wanted to process the return and get me out the door. I asked if they had a restroom I could use, he rudely replied "NO!" and just handed me my paperwork to get me out of his store.I will never return to this place again!
