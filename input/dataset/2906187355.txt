We had so much fun! There were 9 of us that did the Breakout Room ranging from ages 15-69, and we all contributed something! Such a great family experience. Puzzles were hard, but not too hard. We escaped with time to spare. Then 5 of us stayed and played The Writers Cabin. Again challenging puzzles, but as long as we all worked together we figured it out. We only had 6 seconds left!!!! Would totally recommend this for anyone who loves puzzles and escape rooms.
