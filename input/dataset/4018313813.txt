Usually I come in to Zupas to eat my soup and salad but since they don't have anymore blood orange vinaigrette for your salad anymore don't bother coming if that's your favorite salad dressing just letting you know this will be my last time here maybe I'll try Panera and see if they have blood orange vinaigrette next time but this is off the list for now
