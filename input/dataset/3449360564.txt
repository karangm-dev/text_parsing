We dined in for dinner tonight for the first time. The atmosphere was nice and the restaurant was very clean. I came based on the Yelp reviews I read and was not disappointed. We ordered the pad Thai with chicken and shrimp, and the green curry with tofu. Both were delicious! Green curry was some of the best I've had. Tofu was firm and tasty, vegetables were fresh and crisp. Best part is this place is just up the street from my house. Will definitely be back!
