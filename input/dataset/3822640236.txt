After sifting through a few plumbers on Yelp. I opted for Plumbing Upgrade to look at a problematic plunger assembly on my downstairs bathroom. I had tried to adjust it myself, but any efforts did not solve the problem.Easy to set up an appointment. Note, like a lot of plumbers, there is a service fee to show up and analyze the problem. Their fee is waived if the work is allowed to be done. Plumber called before arriving during the time window. Checked it out and said that yes, it did need to be replaced. Sorry, can't recall his name now, but his English was not the greatest. I did up end speaking to Alex on the phone to make sure there was no misunderstandings.On his way out, I did finally remember that my pressure regulator had been leaking for awhile and asked him to look at that too. I kept forgetting to have someone look at that, which is my fault. Had that replaced the next morning when he could go out and buy a new one.Prices were very reasonable compared to what quotes I had received. Although I did have to speak to someone else on the phone, both Alex and his plumber were very courteous and professional about the whole experience. I would definitely recommend.
