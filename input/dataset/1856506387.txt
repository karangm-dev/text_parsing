More coupon issues, this time with target coupons out of their little 4th of july promo book. The computer won't over read their own coupons and the cashier was rude and incompetent I left with out the item and went down the street and bought it elsewhere.  I don't know why I bother to continue to try this store, and other target is better then this and they just don't seem to care. Go to North Olmsted or W117th instead.
