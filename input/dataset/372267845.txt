Don't look any further, this is the place.  While I was making an appointment, I heard Stefanie at the front desk on the phone with a patient that needed results before a vacation, she assured the person on the phone that she would contact the proper people and get right back to her.. and then she did it!My appt. was for a couple of annual tests, mammography, which was administered by Denise.  She was great!  I asked about the 3D imaging technology and she patiently explained how it works.  Next up, bone density with Erica!  Again, patient, pleasant, and happy service.  The entire visit was way above normal expectations!
