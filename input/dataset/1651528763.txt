Devyn recommended the monthly special for the Fast Break Burrito that comes with chips, salsa, and a drink. I went with her recommendation and ordered mine with the blacken chicken. It had their amazing green sauce inside. I absolutely loved the food. Everything was so fresh and came out super fast! Devyn was very efficient and had excellent customer service. I can't wait to bring my family here and try the rest of the menu.
