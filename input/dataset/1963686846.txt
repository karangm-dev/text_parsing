Initial thoughts upon sitting down with a beer and hitting my first 15 shots: holy cow, I want to build one of these for myself! Getting to the nitty gritty of the review and thinking of the questions people would ask before visiting my review becomes a bit more specific. #1 * The wait staff was hired yesterday. Or at least that is the view I had when asking a few very simple questions about the system used here. They seemed to have zero training on the system used and how to operate simple functions. #2 * Our waitress was very eager to learn from us what we found out through trying it out. #3 * Computer systems down. There were more error screens than you could imagine here. One of the staff even said the app has never worked here. That's pathetic. Get someone on it. My review is sounding awfully negative (but it needed to be said, otherwise no one would know what can be improved upon), which doesn't at all reflect my experience here so the rest will be how much fun I had. * Our waitress Michelle was amazing. It looks like she only had two tables, so you can't beat a ratio of 1:9. She was constantly making sure we were happy with what was on our table. * The music varies a ton! A good thing! I enjoyed listening to the cult classics and party music. * OMG The food! The food was top quality. Worth twice what it costs. No joke. It is blatantly obvious I'm a bullet/list reviewer so here are my key points. *Technology- 6/10 train staff and hire an IT person. * Staff- 10/10 Some of the most friendly and eager staff I've seen around. Keep it up. * Food- 10/10 Id come here just to eat. Period. * Overall experience- 9/10 This place was a blast. I plan on visiting as often as I can when in the area. It is totally worth every penny.
