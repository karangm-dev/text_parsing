Back in the day this used to be THE buffet to go to. I was excited to try it again  but was very disappointed. I enjoyed eating the raw rish, but some of the other food didn't taste very fresh. The meat options were also tough and overcooked. The caviar bar was underwhelming and they limit you to 3 small servings per each visit to the area. As vegas buffets go, for the price I'd much rather spend my time eating at wicked spoon or bacchanal.
