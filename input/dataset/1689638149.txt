Terrible service. Although the food was okay, one of the servers, Christine, was racist. When the table next to us informed her that we were calling her, she made an annoyed expression, ignored us, and our order was never taken care of. She sat next to and talked with other male customers. I've never seen such a brazen-faced and rude worker. The management here is horrible.
