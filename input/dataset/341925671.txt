After just moving to Madison from Chicago, my husband and I needed a second car to accommodate our work schedules. I chose Goben because I liked their inventory, the flexible financing options they advertised on their website,  and the fact that they were seemingly family-oriented and willing to go above and beyond for their customers. We worked with Quinn and he was immediately willing to let me test-drive the vehicle I had been eyeing online, without doing the whole "used car salesman" spiel. He was not pushy, he patiently answered all of our questions, and he made the experience fun. After deciding we wanted to purchase the car, we went into the office to work with one of their finance guys. I recently graduated law school and my husband recently graduated medical school, so you can imagine that our finances are not in perfect shape! As such, we were not optimistic that we'd be walking out of there with a car that day. Let me tell you, these guys are amazing. I didn't catch the name of the guy who did all the heavy financial lifting, but he went so above his job duties to make it work for us. Everyone was kind, kept offering us water, joked around, and apologized for the wait (even though they were working on our loan application the whole time- if anything, we should have apologized to them!).Ultimately, they made it happen for us. We got exactly the financing option we needed as we are starting out our careers, and we felt that the whole process was transparent and fair. If you're looking for massive inventory or tricked out models, this may not be the place. But if you have an idea of what you want, these guys will take care of you! Loving our new Jeep Compass- thanks Goben!
