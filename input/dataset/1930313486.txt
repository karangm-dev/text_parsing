I'm sorry fellow Yelpers but this place was terrible. First off I kept getting passed over for couples who arrived after me. I let it slide the 1st time but it about happened again and i had to say something. I was seated and ordered Edamame for a starter that never arrived.  I ordered my sushi and my drink and never saw the waitress again to fill my drink, nothing. I only finished 1/2 my 2 rolls which were terrible, paid my bill and left. There is FAR better quality Sushi in Phoenix. This place was just bad. Food, service, even the ambience lacked quality. Sorry people but this was terrible,  I would go somewhere else. I won't ever go back.
