BlahNot my scene AT ALL.1. There is NO WHERE to SIT unless you want to shell on a ton of money for table service. 2. So so sooo crowded. The pools start looking a little gross after a while. You can see a layer of OIL floating on the water from all the greasy bodies awkwardly dancing in the poolsIt's a really pretty venue with a gorgeous bar area (free mimosas for girls on the guest list!) but just not my scene. I'd much rather relax on at my hotel pool with a fruity drink and a comfy chair.I'd say it's definitely worth visiting once, but I don't know if I'll come back :-\ I'm just glad my friends and I were able to get in for free and score free mimosas too while we were in there.
