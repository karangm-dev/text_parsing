I always hated urgent cares. But because my boyfriend has been having health problems and can't afford to always go to the ER we came here. There was no true doctor to help, as well as the medicine they prescribed him was all completely wrong. He had visual problems in the office and they saw but still gave him wrong prescription. How is that even possible?
