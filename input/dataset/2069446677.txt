I REALLY wanted to like this spa. In fact, my pedicure was amazing. I had Rashida, who was friendly, personable, and great at her craft. But the massage. Oh dear. I paid for the 80-minute deep tissue massage because I like firmer pressure. There were a few times I thought I must be on Ellen Degeneres as a joke...the masseuse's hand motions were fast - to the point that my muscles were tensing and I could not relax. There was also never 'deep' tissue. It felt like a Swedish Massage. During the massage, the masseuse never checked in with me regarding pressure or my comfort level.I was highly disappointed. Would not return here or recommend it to others.
