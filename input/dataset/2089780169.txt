Where do I begin. To start it was not busy however it took 4 girls to wait on one customer. They all seemed as though it was the first day of work, no visible mgr in sight. The place was dirty, open ice cream containers out on the dirty counter, it's fairly expensive and not a good as I remember. Needless to say I will not be back. Stay away,I should have read the reviews.
