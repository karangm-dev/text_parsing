I spent 45 minutes in this store shopping for my babies and our home.  Got to the check out counter and unloaded my order.  The cashier started checking me out and then called another cashier over and she told me Target stores were on probation and could no longer take WIC.  There is not one sign posted anywhere to this in the store or on the front window of the store.  The isles still have the WIC symbols on them.  The cashier said she could call the front manager and I told her what good was it going to do if they don't take WIC.  I left a full cart with her and told her I had to go elsewhere now. When I got home I called the corporate office and put in a complaint.  The person I spoke with had no knowledge of this but took my name and said he was going to look into the matter and advised me to call the manager at the store.I called the manager at the store and the only thing he could be bothered to tell me was they used to take WIC but don't any longer.  I told him there were no signs posted to that and that the shelves still had the WIC stickers on them.  His answer to me was that there was no sign on the front window saying they took WIC.  I also told him I spoke with some employees regarding something I was looking for and they saw the WIC checks in my hand and never said anything.This store is taking up space.  I have gone there numerous times on a Sunday for milk and eggs only to find they were totally out of whole milk and eggs.  Please who is doing the ordering.  I will continue to shop at Walmart even though this store is only a mile away from me.  The manager never even said he was sorry, only had excuses, I hung up.
