Guy was nice. I guess it was expected that I'd get ripped off since computer repair services are overpriced.My laptop came with an extra dent on top of the hard-drive slot, which I really did not appreciate.. He was nice though, and was helpful.If knowledge of computers is limited and your hard drive dies, need to replace ram or your machine is infected with a virus, and your friends and family members also have limited knowledge that they cannot help you, I think this is a decent place.I went because I suspected my hard drive died and I had not backed up documents onto my other laptop. For a diagnostic and for retrieving my data (apparently free of charge) was $50 plus tax. I think it was over-priced, but I guess that is the business.So overall:- the gentleman (I believe his name was Amed, my spelling is probably ignorantly wrong.. :-/ ) was resourceful- for what he did, cost was overpriced- the dent in the laptop unaccounted forI don't recommend going here. Information is readily available these days, I encourage using wikipedia or google to read up on computer repairs or ask a family member or friend; parts are reasonably cheap on amazon, newegg, dhgate, even factory direct or bestbuy (very rarely bestbuy or futureshop), or ebay if you are patient, and save on 100 bucks. Or maybe there is actually a store that offers off the market fair price that I have not yet seen.
