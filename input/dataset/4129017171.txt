Best, most flavorful Chicken Quesadilla we ever had! Mesquite grilled chicken with Mozzarella cheese. Fresh salsa bar where you select your toppings ( freshly made Pico De Gallo for example ). Don't expect to be able to eat inside. This place is very busy and they only have 5 tables. There are a couple of tables outside, if it's not too hot out.
