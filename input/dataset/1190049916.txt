I've been using Mike, formerly Busted Knuckle Auto, for 8 years and he's the best in town. I typically do my own work, and anytime I had something beyond me (let's be honest a lot of mechanic work isn't easy lol) and he's always come and helped me at a good price. Hes helped me and my family and friends anytime we have anything wrong and he's the only mechanic I ever call.
