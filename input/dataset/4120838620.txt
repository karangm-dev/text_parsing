Stopped in today passing through Mesa and saw this as we were on Baseline. Upon walking it, it did not have an unpleasant odor that other aquarium stores have had and the tanks in the front were all very clean and clear. They have a HUGE selection of saltwater and freshwater fish, of all sizes and genders. The sailfin mollies they had were beautiful and healthy looking, and the discus were absolutely breathtaking. We weren't really acknowledged by any employees until we had almost walked through the whole store (he was very polite) but it was fairly busy. My only complaint about this store (and why I gave it 2 stars) was because the way the betta fish were kept in RIDICULOUSLY tiny bowls, and some were only half filled with water. Also, where the employee was putting air into a bag for a customer purchasing a tang, I saw even SMALLER  plastic containers that Bettas were in. Until that changes, I would recommend other aquarium stores in Mesa because there are others that don't carry Bettas to be put in that condition :(
