No better than any other moving company. Claimed to be full service, I was told on the phone that they could dismount my TV and move it but when the movers got there they said they have never taken a down before which lead to the rocket scientist trying and breaking my 2500.00 that I have yet to here anything from the complaint I filed. I've had these guys and two men in a truck and it's the exact same service. Oh, they were 45 minutes late on arrival.
