I used to come here for years and got tired of the poor paint jobs, raised nail acrylics after a full set, and the quick slap on job of doing my nails. I would get pedicures and end up with chipped polish or just a bad paint job or lacking scrub. I mean if I'm paying $25-30 per hr, then I shouldn't have to go home and redo my buffing. They just need to take their time and do the jobs right and with integrity.
