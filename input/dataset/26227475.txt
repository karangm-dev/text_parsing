This is one heaven of a pure vegetarian Indian restaurant at Las Vegas . To be very honest Rani's has be our blessing in Vegas , not your fancy Indian restaurant but the food tastes so much like home cooked meals . I was traveling with my folks from India and my 18 month old son and food had always been a concern for us and this was our go to place .they are not over priced and they are located in an Indian grocery store so it was lot more convenient for us to even pick up water and milk and other things . Their menu is restricted and so is their time -they open by 10:00am and close by 9:00pm so it makes more sense to plan ahead and go . The food is fresh and clean , the rotis are  super soft and the rice is well cooked and the person at the counter is very helpful and she always suggests the quantities and portions and they do not over sell . I stayed on the strip and the drive to this place was about 15 minutes which was not too bad and the drive was worth it .
