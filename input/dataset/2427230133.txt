This review is for the pharmacy in general and my pharmacist, Marc, in particular. Marc is amazing. He really cares about his patients, has great customer service, and always helps me (a grad student) save money on my prescriptions. I know this is so funny to say, but I really am very grateful to have him as my pharmacist. I just recently moved back to Tempe and I am so stoked to be able to visit this pharmacy again regularly.
