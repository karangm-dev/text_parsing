While the sign out front advertised just the right kind of breakfast we were looking for the service left a bad taste (and potentially dangerous one) in my mouth.  It wasn't a cheap meal ($3.50 for coffee and $4.00 for hot tea) but the food like the steak and eggs and the breakfast combo did taste pretty good.Service was like they were either ignoring us or being chased by something with the speed they came to the table and then took off again.  Where they lost all kinds of stars was with my coffee.  I told them decaf - several times - but when they gave me my cup and I tasted it it was not decaf.  I can tell the difference; I have to know the difference.So when we finally got someone to come back to our table we said this wasn't decaf give us decaf.  Guy comes back with a carafe that was NOT marked decaf.  He swore it was and then walked off with it and poured another table some coffee.  Had to get another person to take that cup away and give me the real decaf.  If you don't have your carafes marked and/or don't know or understand the difference between regular and decaf coffee then you don't need to be a server.
