I just went to another hair salon to finally fix my hair after my last appointment at this salon.... I went in with box dyed black hair and asked for  a bleach  and my hair and scalp were destroyed. I has been a while since I went, but after seeing the work from the recent stylist I went to I felt like I should post this review to let people know. First of all, I was assigned a guy who told me he was newly hired and he was sooooo sweet. However, after the appointment I had hot roots and my black was still there in the rest of my hair (the guy spent half and hour rubbing my roots with a brush and scalp and completely hurt it). The owner of the salon "approved" my colour and told me it looked good (lol) and I paid 160$ total.  They told me that it looked black because of the light btw. When I arrived home I realized that in natural light it looked waaayyy worse. I called them, they re-scheduled an appointment because they totally recognized me... and I wasted again my time with the same guy and left with an orange- toned black/brown. He applied a toner instead of trying to bleach again and left it there for and hour....At that point I was over it and I calmly left without causing any drama. Obviously, the owner let me go with that shitty colour again knowing that it was not what I asked for (or asked to fix).Basically, if you are looking to bleach your black box-dyed hair do not waste your money in this salon. It takes professionals to do that and, in my opinion, both the owner and the hairstylist that was assigned to me lacked of professionalism and honesty.
