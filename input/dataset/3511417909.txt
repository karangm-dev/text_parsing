I am not happy with the delivery service from RC Willie. On the first attempt, I selected a couch that I loved and when they attempted to deliver, they said my coach was too long. I considered it and I went back and selected a 7 foot couch. On the second delivery attempt, they arrived and attempted once to put in the elevator. They said that it wouldn't fit. I looked at the dimensions of the fright elevator compared to the couch, and the couch should definitely fit. They refused to attempt it again. I called customer service and cancelled my whole complete order. I'm upset also because I was told, on my second visit, the new couch should fit. Do not want anything to do with RC Willie.
