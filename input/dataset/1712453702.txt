Two stars for the quickness of the line, however service is awful. Tara was the cashier and was short and rude the entire time before and when ordering. As if I was supposed to know no substitutions at all. Simply tell me. However the gentleman making my order was nice. Customer service needs some work overall. Hope at least the food is good.
