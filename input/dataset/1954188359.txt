I've walked past this store for quite awhile and finally stopped in when my old pair of Birkenstocks decided to wear a hole in themselves. Amy helped me find a nice pair of oiled leather Birkenstocks in the proper size. They were comfortable from the moment I slipped them on.Amy also explained that I could have my old Birkenstocks resoled and have the straps reconditioned. I'm seriously thinking about it because I loved my pair of purple suede Birkenstocks. I might change over to the classic sole instead. It is quite a bit more comfortable than the soft foot bed. I like this store and the one to one customer service. This will be my go to walking shoe store. FYI, they'll be moving to the west side of Best of the West in a few weeks.
