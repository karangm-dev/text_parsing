I'm not sure how you can rate a classic ice cream stop less than 5 stars! Bruster's is nation wide, probably because they know how to make people smile with ice cream! I got a sundae here, and it was more than plenty after dinner - I couldn't finish it. If you want a cool dessert on a hot Phoenix day . . . or a cold day . . . . or anything in the middle, this is a good choice if you're in the area!
