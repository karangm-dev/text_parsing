I've recently moved to Airdrie so have been slowly trying out some of the local pubs and restaurants.My husband and I decided to give pour beer market a try and go for drinks and appies. My first impression of this place was less than stellar. First off there was a group of somewhat shady looking men smoking right outside the entrance. After walking through the cloud of smoke we entered the somewhat desolate looking bar. It was a Wednesday evening and mostly empty except for what looked to be a few regulars who stared at us when we came in like we didn't belong there. I also noticed that the layout of the bar was kind of odd without much flow and had a bit of a dirty look to it.We quickly found a table and the waitress was prompt getting our drinks, though they were all out of the beer that was supposed to be on special. Also for a place called "pour beer market" I was underwhelmed with the beer selection. We then decided to take a look at the menu and my appetite was kind of turned off by the dirty menu. We ordered the nachos since there really wasn't much that appealed to us on the menu and nothing really unique. The nachos were your standard pub nachos, nothing to complain about there. We decided against ordering any more beer since we just weren't enjoying the atmosphere and the weird dance music.All in all I would not return.
