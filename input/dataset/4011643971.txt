I would give this place a 0 if I could. We got magnetic buisness signs made. Asked if there is any special care to be taken, as this is the first set of magnets we have had, answered with " no. Nothing to worry about". The first magnet fell off the car after week. We went back to get a new one. We were told no problem. We will make it for you. Went back two weeks later after the second magnet fell off. They lost the file with our design. They refused to return phone calls. Hung up on us when we called to get a status update of the new magnets to be made. Then threatened to call the police on us and our 6 and 8 year old daughters, while we were there trying to get a refund. Horrible customer service.
