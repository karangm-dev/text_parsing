The location is very convenient very close to freeway access. Normally I'm offered more options, even on the back of the menu it says 4, I only was given 3, the cucumber kimchee was not given this time. Was kind of disappointed by this. On my table we were out of soy sauce as well. The chicken dishes that we ordered were decent. They were out of mochi too. Today I guess Santa wasn't real....
