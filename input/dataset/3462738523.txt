Many people probably drive right by but I promise you'll want to stop in! It's absolutely a diamond in the rough and if you're looking for fancy seating it's not the place for you. But we didn't come for fine dining, we came for fine sandwiches! I knew by the menu these fellow New Yorkers knew how to make a breakfast sandwich. Since moving down here to Charlotte from upstate NY it's been hard to find a quality sandwich! Well finally we found the place! I ordered two, a ham egg and cheese on an everything bagel, and a number 30 (the Long Islander) on a sub roll! Both were awesome! I'll be back no question about it!
