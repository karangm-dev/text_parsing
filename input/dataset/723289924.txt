Worst service I've ever received! First off, we walked in to ask the price of a puppy...the woman who responded was dismissive and rude. The wall where the puppies are housed was ridiculously overcrowded. We asked four times to play with a puppy, the associates forgot we had asked and never returned. We waited 20 minutes to finally play with him. The play room we were put in was out of hand sanitizer so the associate told use to spray the cleaner they use on the floor on our hands, he tried to tell me it was the same thing, just not foamy. I know I was lied to, as my hands then smelt of bleach! I asked to play with numerous puppies because I was not impressed by the ones I had seen, and he told me no. And that I could only see two. He also old failed to tell me the price of the puppy until I asked four times. Very rude. Very dismissive. Terrible experience.
