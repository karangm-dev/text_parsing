Went to this salon today, on a whim... The only good thing about this salon was that they were playing Twilight (the last one, that I haven't  seen).  I walked in was told they could take care if me immediately; I picked a color (selection isn't to big) & sat down.. 10 min later (twilight made it go by fast) someone came out & told me " she will be done eating soon" .. Umm okay, now I'm waiting for someone to have lunch when I was told I would be helped immediately.. Mind you there were other people whom worked there doing nothing. As I was about to complain a lady walked out & started helping me... Honestly this was the WORST manicure & pedicure I've EVER had in my life. And I get my nails done at random places at least 3x a month .. They barely cut my cuticles, basically leaving my dead cuticles! After explaining to the lady several times; even showing her by cutting them myself .. She could not do it. My nails are all oddly shaped & my toe nails were cut way too much. They were trying to be nice, but I feel they just couldn't comprehend or didn't want to do what I consider a "normal manicure". My nail polish looks as if I painted my nails in the car & I am just totally dissatisfied .. :(((((
