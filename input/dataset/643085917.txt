Ehhh...I must be spoiled by all the better adult stores in LA and OC because this store was overpriced and overrated! Seriously, is this an Adam and Eve outlet? There were so many Adam and Eve products on the shelves and they had the gall to charge 2-3x the online price. The same bottle of JO we get in OC is $9 more. Geez. Even KY is expensive here! It's a goddamned drugstore brand!This place is mostly DVDS...they take up the ENTIRE floor! Who buys that crap any more? There's not a lot of the weirder, edgier stuff, so if you're a plain jane, you found the right store! Yeah, yeah this place is open 24h and when you're in a pinch for an emergency vibe or some lube at 2am, you're golden.
