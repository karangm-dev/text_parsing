I got the Hawaiian tuna & Lomi salmon sushiritto. OMG, yes! The server was super helpful and wrapped my gigantic burrito without bursting it. Mad props cuz I always get everything on it. The spicy mayo was not overkill and the flavor is on point. I'm ready to go back and I haven't even left yet haha!
