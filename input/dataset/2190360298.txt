I'm sad it took me so long to find this place. I had a protein shake that was awesome. I also had the bld quesadilla which was amaze balls as well. The pico would stand on its own but when added to he quesadilla it's even better. I may be back tomorrow. And no, I wasn't able to finish all of it. :-)
