I would rate this location negative stars! The manager/owner of this location should be very concerned! Restaurant was half empty and the service was the worst we have had in a long time. Listened to the hostess argue about where to sit us and another party. That was awkward! We were told it would be a few minutes since it was really busy. Busy? Half empty restaurant on a Saturday night? We should have walked out at that point because it was all down hill from there. While waiting for the waiter, the booth next to us became frustrated because they never could get their waiter to their table. They had to approach the hostess stand and ask for help. Nothing was done and they simply pointed and said "oh he is over there I am sure he will come by this way". For us, we only saw the waiter to order our drinks and food. I had to nurse my soda for fear I wouldn't have anything to drink with my meal. My daughter had no drink during her dinner- not even water. Not to mention my meal came out wrong, but the waiter would not have known since he didn't care to check to make sure we got everything we need. I will never go back to this location. There needs to be some good management involvement to get this place turned around. Half empty restaurant on a Saturday night tells me there are bigger problems or perhaps multiple experiences like mine!
