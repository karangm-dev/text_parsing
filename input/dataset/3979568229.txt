This is the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant in Pittsburgh.  If I could give this place 0 stars I would. We stopped in on a Monday evening at around 7:00 because it looked nice having recently been redone. We decided to sit at the bar to hopefully order a few glasses of wine. After about 5 minutes the bar tender decided to acknowledge our presence and asked what we wanted. After looking at a not too large list of wines by the glass we told the bar tender what we wanted. He returned with one glass of wine and then forgot what I had ordered. After a while we asked to see a menu and decided to order the stuffed pepper appetizer. We were told they didn't have that.  To make a long story short, we left with only having our two glasses of wine and no food. My suggestion is that you can go many places in downtown Pittsburgh and get treated very nicely and get good food... BUT NOT HERE!Don't waste your time or money. They apparently don't want the business.
