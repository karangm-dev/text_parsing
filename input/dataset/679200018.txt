I bought a bike from Oxygen Bike company two years ago (great experience dealing with Chris, the manager). I recently had a fall after dodging someone who fell off their skateboard. My bike handle bent inwards. I brought it in to see if it could be fixed. Jeremy fixed it right up (handle bar wasn't broken), and checked to make sure everything else was running fine. Great chatting with Jeremy and Jacob (nice to see Chris there too). Great people working here. P.S. Shawn was also great over e-mail exchanges.
