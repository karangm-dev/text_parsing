I recently had my hair cut and balyaged by Nikki at Alchemy. I made my appt. based on the great yelp reviews and they really lived up to the reviews! The atmosphere is unpretentious and customer focused and I felt so comfortable during my visit. The haircut I received is amazing, maybe the best I have had since moving to NC. I love the balyage as well. Nikki really listened to what I wanted and then made it happen. I get compliments on it constantly!  Looking forward to my next visit!
