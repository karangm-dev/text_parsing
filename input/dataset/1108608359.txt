Horrible service! We waited 40 minutes for a table, 20 minutes for service, 30 minutes for an iced tea and another hour for food. Then I had to ask twice for an iced tea refiill. I will not be returning and wouldn't have put my name on this restaurant if I was a celebrity chef.I almost forgot to review the food. The chicken wings were over cooked and the quad fries tasted all the same just cut differently. I think it was seasoning salt used heavily on all of the fries. The burgers were OK but not memorable.
