Been a customer since I was in high school (14 years ago) and to this date, there has been and probably always be a lineup of 20 people that goes out to the front door. Either business is blooming, or the ordering system needs a change for once. Ill give them the benefit of the doubt. Every beverage is done perfectly each time. I will always be a returning customer that orders the daily special. Wish you would do something about people smoking by the front door.
