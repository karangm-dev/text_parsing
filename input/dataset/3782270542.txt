It can be hard to find a good Chinese restaurant, and after moving out to Arizona from the other side of the country, I was a little afraid of trying out a new place to get my Chinese food from, but this one was pretty awesome! The food was delicious, and the restaurant was clean. The waitress was really nice and attentive. Really on top of her game, offering refills when they were needed. I'd highly recommend checking it out!
