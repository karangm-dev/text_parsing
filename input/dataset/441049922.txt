The lady on the phone wasn't too friendly even though I needed an emergency ekg. The nurse had no idea what I was saying and barely spoke English. Thank goodness there was only 1 person in front of me and it took only about 45 minutes to be seen. This was the closest urgent care to my house and I needed to be seen ASAP because I got surgery yesterday. The location is in the ghetto but it is very contemporary designed and clean. They took my Sierra health and life PPO insurance. I got my EKG and the nurse said it was okay but then the doctor said it was abnormal?! What the hell is wrong with this place. The next day I came in for a ultrasound and the tech wasn't allowed to tell me my results without the doctor being there! How ridiculous.
