Sometimes you just get plain lucky and stumble into a place that's damn good and only once your there do you look at there yelp rating and realize that the food gods led you there with divine guidance.  This place isn't fancy, but it's got a 5 star rating and pushing 200 reviews for a reason. It's only a matter of time before I turn on some food TV show and see them being featured.  Yeah, it's that good. Then I won't be able to get near the place.  For now I could almost miss the joint when driving by but don't, just don't.  The staff was fun and friendly and genuinely cared about our experience.  Yeah, like that's not refreshing.  So get in there.  Eat up. Enjoy!!!
