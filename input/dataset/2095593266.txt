Don in the camera section is literally the best customer service person I've ever dealt with. He answered every single question I threw at him including very specific technical questions regarding my Canon Rebel SL1 purchase. He is ACTUALLY an expert on what he sells and I appreciate that more than 5/5 stars can show. I probably spent 45 minutes talking to him and left the store with a great camera and the accessories I needed.
