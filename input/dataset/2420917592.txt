This is a TRUE five start restaurant. Our party of three was two out-of-towners and one local who was new to the area. We had El Chorro recommended to us by friends in Mesa. A short wait at the bar and we were seated on the patio and had a great server.We had short ribs, seafood pasta and trout almondine with mussels for an appetizer. The seafood pasta and mussels were a bit overkill on seafood, but I am a seafood lover and loved it all. The new Paradise Valley member of our group (fresh out of college) loved it as well as us older folks and plans to return as soon as she can. All and all a wonderful evening out. We have added it to our must visit in Phoenix list.
