Can't believe I had never been here before! Talk about a hidden bread gem in Las Vegas! All types of fresh baked goodies and at great prices! From cinnamon rolls to pretzel rolls, pretty much everything you can think of. They also have a day old bread section with discounted prices. Best of all, Black and White cookies are only .95!
