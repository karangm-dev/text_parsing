This place was horrendous. I always get bad service/food at milestones (usually go to the ones in downtown Toronto) but for some reason i go back and give them another chance. So this is what happened:I order the crispy chicken burger, the only thing i ever get at this spot, and my friend orders a side of salad with NO bacon. I get the chicken burger and it tastes nothing like it usually does.. tastes more fishy and bland than crispy spicy chicken. I have barely 3 bites and leave the rest. My friend is halfway through her salad when she notices bits of bacon. Wtf? We call the server over and mention that we said NO bacon on the salad and then i ask him why my chicken burger tastes like fish and is not spicy AT ALL and he says he is positive its chicken.... 10 minutes later the manager passes by to tell us that dessert is on the house and he will not charge me for the burger (which i appreciate. I just wish i was able to enjoy a good meal after a long day at work). My friend orders her free dessert (donuts), and then the server comes by 10 minutes later to inform us that they actually ran out of donuts.  I hate milestones. The service is usually bad (mostly in downtown) and the food is crappy as hell.Oh did i mention i got home and projectile vomited ? Yep. NEVER AGAIN.
