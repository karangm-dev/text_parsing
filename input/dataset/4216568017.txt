I love New Image. My Husband and I both go there. He got his visible tattoo removed, just in time before he started his new job. It's completely gone. I get laser hair removal, facials, exc. When u look good u feel good. Dr. Mall is amazing. He is really friendly and makes me feel so comfortable. Cindy Hernandez is the BEST. Her smile alone is so warming. She pays very close attention to details and gives u the best advise for ur skin.
