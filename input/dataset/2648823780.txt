Horrible! Bought a replacement laptop cord for 50 bucks way overpriced (according to amazon) and it stopped working after 2 months of use. When I brought it in, it took them 5 minutes before they realized they had a customer (could hear 3 men laughing about something in the back). Then they told me my laptop cord had been dropped although the cord has not left it's place on my carpeted floor. Very disappointed in the service I received and the price I paid. I would give 0 stars but yelp won't let me.
