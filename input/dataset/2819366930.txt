I only got the coffee because the room does not offer any type of coffee in the room. If you are going anytime during the day, be prepared to wait for about 10-15 minutes or so.They move the line as quickly as they can, so you aren't waiting too long.The drinks about the same as any other Starbucks, but around a dollar or more expensive per drink.The big issue I had was you could not order on the mobile app, so you had to wait in line.  The coffee was pretty good. Same as pretty much every other location. I liked it and I went a couple of times when I stayed at the hotel.
