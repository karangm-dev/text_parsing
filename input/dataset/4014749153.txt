Seven Hills Lanes is a a great little bowling alley. Their prices are great, and they have a nice snack bar, a regular bar, arcade games, and of course, they have bowling. Their cosmic bowling on Friday nights is very fun, and it is a great value for the money, at $15 with shoe rental included for all-you-can-bowl from 10:30pm to 1:00am. This bowling alley is only 12 lanes, so it's not huge by any means, but it's a great spot for locals to hang out. The first time that I went here was back in the early 2000s, and it's still the same alley that I remember from back then. It still has a classic bowling alley feel, but the scoring systems, lanes, and tables/chairs are all modern and up-to-date. It's also a great place to rent out for birthday parties. I attended quite a few birthday parties here throughout my childhood, and it was always fun. Overall, Seven Hills Lanes is great, and I always have fun every time that I go here.
