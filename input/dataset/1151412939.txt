Been going to see Bret for a few years now, always delivers honest, quality work. But special shout out for him, I was looking to buy a boat over Memorial Day and owner was having trouble getting boat to run(kinda scary for new buyer), called Bret and he came in on Memorial Day to diagnose the issue. Of course he found it and fixed it, and I'm the proud owner of a new boat! Thanks again Bret!!
