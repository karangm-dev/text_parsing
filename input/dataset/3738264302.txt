The parrots are disgusting. They are noisy, dirty, and one even will curse at you. As far as Yoli's. I sat outside for 15 minutes before someone even attempted to take our order and then it was 45 minutes to get a sandwich! They blamed it on a large party being there and not even grill space. I would never go there again!
