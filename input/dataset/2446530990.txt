They get one stars because they keep hiring these rude, untrained, unprofessional, employees. I refuse to order from this one again,even though it is literally right by my house. It's cool I will take my money to dominoes where they won't constantly argue with the customer. Or they won't bang on the door like the police and refuse to announce who they are, I mean do they not train their staff on professionalism? Knowing the slogan the customer is always right, and the manager David sounds like a robot and needs more classes! They need to get their lives together, no one wants to deal with this mess at all.
