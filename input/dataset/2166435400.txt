I went into the store this morning to print my prepaid shipping label and send off my package.  The charge was $3.27!!  (After it was already printed and affixed).  I inquired into the charge and was told it was store policy to charge $3 for pulling up the email with the label in it and $0.25 for the copy.  The associate was nice enough about it but this is ridiculous charge for pulling up an email.  I will definitely take all printing and shipping business elsewhere.  This used to be one of my favorite places as all employees are very kind and helpful.
