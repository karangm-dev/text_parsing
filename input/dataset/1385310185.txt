Ok folks! I was craving tacos so me and my son saw this place and decided to try it out. I ordered guacamole and chips, pastor tacos, carne asada tacos and chorizo tacos. The place is clean and staff is friendly. Food came out quickly. So far so good. Then comes the guacamole. It was just ok. It needed lime, salt and maybe some cayenne. Then comes the tacos. They were forgettable. I am comparing them to the other places like this establishment. I was just disappointed. Meat was a bit dry and not a lot of flavor. It would work in a pinch but would not go there again over any other place. Plus they are pretty pricey for what you get. The pineapple was the best part. Good Luck Taqueria El Buen Pastor!
