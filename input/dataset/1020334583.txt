great, great great! I stopped in to meet a buddy for a few beers and found a super awesome spot! WE just had a few beers, they had a happy hour so they had 6 or 7 beers for $2.50! The food looked great as well, but i'll order next time. The ambiance was dope, classic hip hop playing. Just a real chill vibe. Service was spot on and I'm pumped to go back soon!
