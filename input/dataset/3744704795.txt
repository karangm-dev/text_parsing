This used to be someplace I looked forward to when I visited Phoenix.  Last two times .. big disappointment.  Won't go back unless management tells me what they identified as what went "wrong" with so many folks saying just this same thing (it USED to be good) ... and what they did to fix it.  Too many places who want my money to waste it here.If I had a choice between Via and Taco Bell.... it's a toss up.  Still trying to find the mexican food in Phoenix that I can LOVE again.  The Gallo Blanco at the Clarendon shows promise, but I'm still looking.  Sad.
