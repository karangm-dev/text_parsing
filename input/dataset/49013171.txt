Cody, our server, was great.  Unfortunately, the food was not.  While fighting off a couple of flies, our greens beans were way overcooked,l.  My pecan crusted trout was super thin & burnt,  and both of our baked potatoes were way overcooked.  We have eaten at this Black Bear many times, but, today, the food was not that good.  The roast beef was so-so.  Oh, the worse thing of all was the really bitter tasting tartar sauce.  Couldn't even eat it. We may never go back to this one for dinner.  Breakfasts have been good in the past.  I blame their chef & cooks.  I sure hope she doesn't have to share her tip with the cook/chef.  It really was the worse meal we have had in a long time out of all the restaurants we dine.
