Incredibly tasty food, both traditional and contemporary. The portions are huge. We enjoyed several grilled meat salads, consisting of lots of varied toppings, romaine/spring mix lettuces and housemade dressings. We also enjoyed several chicken based dishes. Sauces were abundant and well spiced and salted. Umami was attended to and treated well.The patrons span the spectrum: old and young, couples and families, middle aged groups of friends.Citrus Tea is delightful. Beer prices are very reasonable. Service is great, staff is friendly.Sit in the bar if you're looking to watch TV's or have a more casual ambiance.Tables are too close together but if you can snag a booth you'll enjoy both the food and drinks as well as the ambiance.
