I've eaten here several times. Foods and flavors are good. Today I asked for only banzai bowl with fish and veggies. Had to restart order and got a layer of rice, which I didn't want. In checking my receipt it only said no beans.  The veggies had teriyaki sauce, which I do not like at all. The menu board was new since last time and had no info on teriyaki sauce, so I didn't think about it. Ate the fish and veggies having to pick thru the rice to find it, was hungry. The server/cashier came over and asked how it was. I explained to her I can't stand teriyaki, I told her I'd rather drink battery acid, just to sweet for me. She told me that the banzai vegetables come with teriyaki. As I'd eaten many times before I'm normally fairly specific on my food prep. I'll take the blame on the teriyaki. The server/cashier offered to get something else for me. I said no my fault for not being more specific. Near the bathroom and throughout the restaurant sewer gas odor. I remember that smell from my last visit several months ago.
