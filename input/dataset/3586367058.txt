All of my online shopping accounts had a notation to never, ever, ever, ship anything to me through OnTrac.  I have had packages stolen from in front of my door on 3 separate occasions.  I live in an apartment and my front door is in a heavy traffic area.  There are 4 other apartments that face mine and all of the 3rd floor has to pass by my door to get to their apartments.  I called OnTrac to report the theft and they said it is the "driver's discretion" if they leave it at the door, even though my door is in a high traffic area and my office accepts packages.  Another time OnTrac delivered my package early, yay!  Except I didn't answer my door because they delivered on a SUNDAY and the delivery driver banged on my door yelling "HELLO!  HELLO? HELLO!".  UPS has delivered to my home after 8 PM and has always identified themselves as UPS, but not OnTrac.  I don't open my door unless I am expecting company and certainly not when it sounds like the person wants to murder me.  Since I have had 3 packages stolen from their deliveries, you think they would make a note on my address to NOT leave it at the door.  I have even left notes saying please deliver to the front office and the driver was too lazy to walk the 20 yrs to the office.  Avoid them at all costs!
