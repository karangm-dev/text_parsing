It was just okay. I'm from New York City and we have a Chino Latino which is what I compare this place to except there was no comparison... The one in New York City is way better but the mix is Caribbean Puerto Rican and Dominican and Chinese food. This is Mexican and Chinese which is little bizarre to me
