This is a quirky place. Full-time place of business. Full-time artist gallery. Now you'd think that wouldn't work... but it does. Ah, the strangeness of Tempe and web-workers.And though it's not open to the public at all times, I'd be on the look out for future events here. The outside patio is immense and beckons with a great view of the mountains and stars. It's got night time entertainment written all over it.Can't wait for the next time!
