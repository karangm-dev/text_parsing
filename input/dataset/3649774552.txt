We ate here last Wednesday for the first time. Finding myself on my own tonight, I decided to go for takeout. I ordered the broccoli beef and it was DELICIOUS!! Lots of beef and broccoli in a yummy sauce.  Plus the serving size was enough for dinner and lunch tomorrow. This will definitely be our go to Asian place! I definitely recommend it.
