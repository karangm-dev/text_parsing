Since I placed an order to-go over the phone one time and my burrito was pretty good and in tact, I decided to take hubbs to this place. We were craving some white-washed Mexican food. It seemed to take forever to get drinks, get order placed, get our entrees and to even pay to leave. We asked the waiter to explain how big the tacos were (I believe one of the meals said 3 tacos, rice and beans). He kinda used his hands to demonstrate how big it was. Oh, okay, I thought, pretty decent sized. That would explain that the plate was around $15. Wrong. I get my tacos and they are super duper small. Real small. Good thing they came with rice and beans or else I would've still been starving. Mediocore tacos at best. What was I thinking, urgh. I apologized to my husband for the experience, we were $35 lighter and still hungry.I think it's the decor that attracts young people here, especially on weekends and nights, it almost looks like a college dorm party. No thanks. "It's like an overpriced Taco Bell" were the words that came out of my mouth as we left the place.Note: Why does it cost extra for chips & salsa at Mexican places now??
