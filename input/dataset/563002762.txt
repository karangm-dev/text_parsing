If you like pizza that costs twice as much as it should, but only tastes half as good as it should, then Humble Pie is for you.  I couldn't believe how much I disliked my pepperoni pizza that cost me $16.49. I fully expected that for that much money the pizza would have been a lot better than "barely passable."I should have gone to Pei Wei next door for 60% of the price.
