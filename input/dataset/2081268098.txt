First visit was quite helpful. I was given a free sample of some soap to help with a skin reaction. It worked great so I returned to purchase an entire bar but did not know what the name of the soap was. I asked the same lady that helped me earlier and she didn't take any time to get more details of my visit only to tell me she didn't remember and hurried off leaving me to myself to try and figure it out. I am furious! I drove over an hour to come back for that and this is the treatment I get?! A precious little black lady came over and listened and led me to the product she felt I was talking about and it was indeed what I had used.  When I took it to the counter to pay the nasty attitude white lady all of a sudden had time to talk and remembered me now. At this point I find it insulting even more that I am only important when I have money in my hand. I will order from the soap company directly from now on. I won't be back.
