The worst car rental experience from customer service perspective (actual car worked fine).  Do not use them.  I wish I had looked at Yelp before renting but I rented through Southwest so assumed they would be good.  NOOOO!  Horrible customer service.  Had to wait over an hour to get the car -- long line at counter.  Added on extra charges to final invoice so no longer a low rate.  Hassle to deal with from start to finish.
