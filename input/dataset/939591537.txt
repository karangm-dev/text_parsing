I paid $54 for a so call sterling silver and turquoise ring on my way to a baseball game.  During the game I noticed that my ring finger was turning black.  I returned to the store after the game (couple hours after I had bought the ring) and expressed my disappointment and asked for my money back.  I was treated very rudely.  Not only did the manager not give me my money back, he threatened to call the police, called me a crazy woman and ordered me out of his store.  I've bought a lot of jewelry in my life and I've never had anything discolor my skin.  And I've never dealt with a jeweler who didn't stand by his merchandise and try to keep his customers happy.
