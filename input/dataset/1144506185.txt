Wow! My husband and I started off with the green tomato BLT sliders which were to die for! They are a must to start off with! We then ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of the 5 cheese Mac and cheesy grits. The chicken was fried and seasoned to perfection tasted amazing. The waffle was just as good with their great bourbon maple syrup and the watermelon was quite yummy with a unique flavor. Mac n cheese was very cheesy and delicious and for the grits my husband thought there were good. To top off our visit we had the made to order peach cobbler which was amazing as I'm not even a big fan of peaches I couldn't get enough of this cobbler. Over all the food and service was amazing and we can't wait to eat here again!!!
