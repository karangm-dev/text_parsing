Came here for the first time over the weekend and had a BLAST. I wish they had these in CA. First of all, I am horrible. But it's such a relaxed atmosphere. Our server was so nice and attentive. We ordered drinks and chips and queso. The queso was amazing, salsa and quac not so much.  I had the mac and cheese burger which was huge and amazing. My boyfriend had wings and our friend got sliders which were great. I would definitely come back all the time if they were in CA.
