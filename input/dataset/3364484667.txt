After a night of liquid libations I woke up feeling not so hot and even worse as the day progressed. I researched the "miracle" hangover cure businesses online. After seeing one business that posted video of an IV going in, I decided against it. After about an hour I was desperate and didn't want to feel terrible all day, I had my husband call Reset IV. My husband explained my fear of needles and asked to send the best person for the job. Boy, did they ever! Matt M. was FANTASTIC! He asked questions and explained everything he was doing. I didn't feel the needle go in or out - I can't tell you how relieved I was. I felt better within 20 min and almost symptom free. I still had a headache/neck ache but I typically have issues with my neck, hangover or not. The headache was definitely not as bad as it was before the treatment. My treatment consisted of 1000 ml of saline solution, anti-nausea Med, anti-inflammatory/pain Med, & B12. Seriously....it's worth the money and don't forget to tip Matt M because he knows what he's doing !
