This wasn't a bad meal, or really exceptional in any way.  It isn't like I wish I hadn't eaten there. It is like someone took a chile's and changed the color scheme.I ordered an entree that had almost no flavor. There were plenty of textures, but I couldn't identify one single spice, meat, or taste in it.  I imagine it is how soylent green tastes.
