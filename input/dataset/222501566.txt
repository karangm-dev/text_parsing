It was okay... super hyped for no reason. Came here on a Tuesday afternoon around 2PM. My friend says there are usually line ups for this place, so to my surprise, there were at least 6 empty tables at this time - so we didn't have to wait (and I only had an hour for lunch anyways). We were greeted and seated immediately and handed the one page menu. Very brief and simple, not many choices. My friend and I both got a small noodle bowl. The size was decent, and the noodles were made fresh (very uneven though, some thicker and wider than others, and clumped up in bunches). The soup however... maybe it was my taste buds being altered by being sick, but boy, the soup was super salty, and tasted like boiled tap water... I did not have the stomach to finish the rest of my bowl as I hated the taste tap water.. let alone hot tap water!Although this was a neat place to try out... it's more like a once in a life time sorta deal. :P
