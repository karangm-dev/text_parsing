Walked into the store upstairs from the mall and was greeted by a blonde who was very rude. She said hi how are you? I said good thanks how are you? She didn't respond just looked at me with an uncomfortable smerk. I responded saying Ok well I'm looking for the make up department and she then acted as if she cared and said il take you to my favorite make up artist. The make up artist was very nice and made me feel very comfortable, oppisite to the first girl who greeted me. I got my make up done and loved it. Went home and broke out in a bad rash under my eyes where she applied the new Charlotte Tilbury concealer. My doctor said it must have been dirty and made me have a bad allergic reaction to the oils left behind on the make up brush used. BEWARE if you go for make up!
