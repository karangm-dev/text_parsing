After reading the 5-star reviews, I was so excited to try this place. We drive by it all the time, so I was hoping we would have a new neighborhood favorite. There are always a lot of cars in the parking lot, so I thought it was a good sign. When we walked in, I realized all the cars belong to the people at the bar. It is a very large bar and was nearly packed with people at 1pm. As we sat down in a booth, we quickly noticed the long looks of the people at the other tables. Someone finally came over to give us a menu and asked the table next to us if they also needed menus too but they said they had been waiting for their food for a long time. They finally got their apps but had to ask for their entrees to go because it was so long of a wait. We finally got our order in and waited and waited and waited. Someone from the bar came out to see how we were and we told her that we were waiting for a long time and my husband needed a refill on his drink. She said she would check on our order and refill the drink, then went behind the bar, put down his cup and asked someone at the bar for his order. She never came back and never went to check on the food. The waitress finally comes back (we're there for 45 minutes at this time) and we ask her to just box up the food because we were getting light headed from the paint fumes. We took the food home and it was just OK. The parmesan fries were pretty good but the onion rings, while a great texture, were way too salty. My BBQ pulled pork was more of a chunks of fatty pork, not pulled but the bun was good. My husband's shrimp po'boy was OK but he didn't think he could taste the shrimp. Good bun, though. I wouldn't recommend Jolie's place for food but maybe you can just go for a beer. We won't be back.
