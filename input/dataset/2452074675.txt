After reading previous reviews my friends and I were skeptical about going due to service, well let me tell you Mitch was on point!  Mitch has just the right amount of enthusiasm, was very attentive, and interacted with us just right.  I'm not a fan of fake servers who over do it, so if you want the perfect experience go see Mitch!  Hook him up on his tip too he deserves every dollar! (Don't forget to throw the sushi guy few bucks too!) The food was fresh and delivered in an extremely timely manner!  Good job on turning the place around!  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK MITCH, we will definitely be back!
