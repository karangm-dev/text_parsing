Bad business! While visiting family during the holidays, I had screen on phone changed out and purchased new screen protector. Returned to Utah the next day and noticed my phone was acting strange, i.e., opening up apps, typing data into msg lines, placing calls. I contacted the manager and he wanted me to remove the screen protector, which will not be usable afterwards. Then he wanted me to mail my phone to him, he would replace screen, and mail back to me but not refund me my mailing expenses. I went to a local repair shop and was informed the screen was defective. I contacted the manager at MD Wireless and asked them to pay for the new screen. He wanted me to mail the screen back to him. I explained that I would once he paid for the new screen and he would not entertain anything until I mailed the screen back to him. Avoid this place at all costs!!!
