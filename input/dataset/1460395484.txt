I have bought a chocolate mousse cake from them twice but it wasn't good. It melted very quickly even kept in fridge for some time before the kids cut it. Kids didn't much like it either.I also tried the veggie samosa but that was pathetic not even close to be called a samosa. The bakery is good for regular bread and pastries only.
