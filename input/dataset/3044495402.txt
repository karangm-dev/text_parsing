Great little authentic Hawaiian style restaurant with a little bit of Asian fusion going on. I got the Loco Moco which was excellent. The beef patty was excellently cooked with a little bit of kalbi meat in it. the rice was nice fluffy and cooked correctly with a thick brown mushroom gravy. Comes with one egg for $7.50 or two eggs for $8. Everything else on their menu looked very good. The service was friendly and fast. Definitely will be coming back and trying some other items.
