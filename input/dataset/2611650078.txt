This place is great!  We came as a group of 5 on a Saturday night and had a fantastic time. If you are coming on Saturday, make sure you don't come before 9:30 and plan to spend the WHOLE night here.  For Saturday nights, it is a set menu (we paid $45 per person plus alcohol) and you get loads of excellent food and entertainment.Around 10:00pm, they brought out a bunch of appetizers (excellent baba ghanoush, hummus, lebneh with mint, Shanklish (which is a middle eastern blue cheese type of cheese ball), tabouleh, Kibbeh nayyeh (which is raw meet so I was pretty skeptical about but was delicious) and lots of pita.  You can keep asking for more of any of these items.Around 11:00pm a singer came out.  Although I couldn't understand what she was singing, she sounded good to me and people got up to dance which was fun.Around midnight, they brought out the meat (chicken and beef kabobs and kafta).  By this time of course, you are STUFFED but I had a bit of everything and it was all pretty tasty.  I don't think you can ask for more meat but truthfully, I don't know how anyone could anyway.Then, a belly dancer came out and I think she gave about a 30 minute show and it was really good.After that they bring out Turkish coffee and some sort of cheese dessert.  Then the singer came on again and sang until closing.We stayed until 3:00am.  I would definitely recommend going to this place!  I'm not from a Middle Eastern background and it was a really great way to experience their food and culture.  I was with people who are originally from the Middle East and they all loved it and said it reminded them of home which I think is a pretty good recommendation!
