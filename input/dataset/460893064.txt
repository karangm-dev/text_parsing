I had a watch repaired here. When they gave me the watch back I noticed the second hand was not set correctly. I was told by the older gentleman he did not "feel comfortable fixing it again that it was working but he doesn't know what happened." So he completely ignored the warranty that they say they provide and didn't fix the watch. But they did take my money which makes them frauds and cheats. So if you need help with a watch go some where else. This shop is not trustworthy.
