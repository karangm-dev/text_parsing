Such a beautiful event venue and great experience! My parents and in laws hosted a baby shower and it turned out amazing! The staff was super helpful while booking and were there the day of the event to assure everything went smoothly. Jason was our coordinator and ended up being the bar tender the night of the event so he was perfection and met all of our needs! I would highly recommend this venue for any event.
