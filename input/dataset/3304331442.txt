Ridiculously good. The fresh warm pita with zaatar comes in a small brown paper bag. Great with any of the mezze dips. We got babaghanoush and lebneh (yogurt). We also got the brussel sprouts with cashews. Just the vinaigrette with the roasted sprouts is amazing. I can't explain the taste but if you like brussel sprouts, get this! For the main, my mom and I split the grilled branzino and the grilled octopus. The branzino was delicious. Perfectly grilled, and not too dry. The octopus wasn't cooked enough in my opinion. It's very hard to do, but it just wasn't the correct texture. Overall, Cleo is a great place. It's on the opposite end of the strip but just hop in an uber and have some delicious Mediterranean food!
