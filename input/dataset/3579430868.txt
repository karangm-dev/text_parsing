Kathy and Laura on staff are extremely rude and dismissive.  I will never set foot in this venue again.To treat vendors like they are servants and somehow beneath them is disgusting.  I have never in my life been talked to or treated as badly as I experienced at Spanish Trails.  Apparently, this is Kathy's known reputation around town.  Yet, somehow she still has a job.
