5 Star Happy Hour. Bar None, one the best 'secret' water holes in the downtown. How can you complain about $2 Domestic Drafts? The specially priced food choices are a HH bargain. Bartenders are patient and kind. HH is 7 days a week.And, of course there's always a quesadilla to float in front of you too.  Yes, they validate , 2 hours.This happy hours is not for everyone, but is it is one, for me!
