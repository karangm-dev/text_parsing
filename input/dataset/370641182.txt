I am a local wedding planner and had Sticky Iggy's truck at circus themed wedding here in Vegas. I cannot say enough good things. The guys were so accommodating to us. They adjusted the menu to fit this event perfectly. The food was amazing, the execution was awesome and price point incredibly fair! Thank you so much for everything you did! I look forward to working with you again in the future!! Paulina
