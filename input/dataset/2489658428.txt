First of all, this is known as Ecuadorian style Gelato. That was the very first thing I was told when the friendly staff was helping me and explaining to me all the flavors and stuff. The dessert is great tasting. Very smooth like a sorbet and fruity like one as well. Now if you're lactose intolerant this place is perfect for you, if you want to try the traditional Italian Gelato you'll have to go elsewhere. They also have other flavors besides fruity ones like chocolate and creme brulee which were great!
