I don't understand how this place has such high ratings on yelp? Went for dinner last night. We ordered edamame to start and it was cold and some pieces were still frozen! I don't like to return food so we just kept it on our table. The sushi was not great. It was okay. Some were better than others but I was not impressed. When We got finished eating we were still in conversation and the workers kept asking us if we wanted more food and we kept saying no. Then one waitress claps her hands loudly (interrupting our conversation) and again asks us if we wanted to eat more. We felt rushed so we left. I do not recommend this place to anyone.
