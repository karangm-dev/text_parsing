Horrible car wash:((( I left the car wash and after two hours I opened up my passenger side, and nothing was vacuumed or cleaned. I had to drive back and asked for a manager, who came and vacuumed by herself my car. She was nice, but the other employees are not nice at all. I do not recommend at all, will not be going back!!
