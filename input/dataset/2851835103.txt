I ate at Pigglys for dinner last night. Had a shot called funnel cake and it came out curdled.  Absolutely disgusting. Had some sliders first. They werent great but probably the least gross. The ribs were so hard and tough we had to give up after a few bites. However they were nice enough to take it off the bill. The coleslaw was bad. It tasted expired and looked wilted. The potato salad..not much better. My bathroom experience afterwards was less than desired. This morning I woke up with sharp pains in my stomach. I had to leave work early today because of the pain this place gave me. Moral is this carnie food = no good
