Based on the other high reviews, I tried this place.  Chicken was "ok", but not fresh - was taken from some heat lamps it was sitting under.  No bread available, though it was advertised on the menu.  I don't mind eating at a dive if the food is great, but this place was just a dive, without the great food.
