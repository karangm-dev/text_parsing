I am from Rhode island and it was my very first time going to an In-N-Out burger spot. I wish we had them on the East coast. Id eat this all the time instead of Mcdonald's or Burger King.... their burgers are everything ! Love their fries too! Very cheap and fast service... I will be returning soon in the future.
