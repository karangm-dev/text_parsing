This doctor is a truly remarkable human being. My son has had him as a surgeon twice, both times the bed side manner was unsurpassed.  It was a miracle that we asked for a second opinion.  His experience and charity work are surely a blessing to encounter under any circumstances.  Thank you so much Dr.  Menezes you are awesome, I see and hear experiences of your clients all over the Vegas valley and there is nothing but POSITIVE feedback.  I wish you nothing but the best.
