Ive been coming here for about a year and I used to LOVE this place! Without a doubt, my Sunday plans included coming here for breakfast. But the quality in consumer service has drastically changed and it got so bad, I've had to walk out. Just right now, one of the girls that work at entrance had quite an attitude, threw the menu onto the table and just walked away. We then waited for a while to get water, and keep in mind that it wasn't busy to get someone to come to our table. I got so agitated with not getting any service, been sat at a table with dirty cups and the bill from the last customers that sat there, that we walked away.   It's sad to say that y'all have lost a loyal costumer. This is just one of many examples of the slip in costumer service.
