Ok so the food is very very good the reason I am giving this low stars is because the lady at the front was extremely rude me and my family came in and spent about $50. I have a 18 month old who enjoys being a big girl so I asked for a small cup I could put water in that had a lid and straw and they refused to give it to me said I had to pay for a drink even though I swore to them it was for water for my baby! I think after spending the amount of money or just for the fact that I have a young toddler the last thing I should be having to deal with is my screaming daughter because this place won't give me a cup she can actually drink out of. So again food good service rude!
