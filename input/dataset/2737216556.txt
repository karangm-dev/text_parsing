Awful.  We needed a daytime nanny during a vacation in Scottsdale. They selected a nanny with issues that came up in a background check that we ran ourselves. We spoke to the agency about it over a week prior to the engagement and they seemed apologetic.  No replacement nanny was provided to remedy - clearly we were under the impression that we had no obligation to A plus for their 'service' in finding this nanny. A month later, unethical owner Hilary charged us over 150 dollars for a service fee for finding that nanny, which of course we did not use.  She refuses to reverse this charge. Beware on many levels!!
