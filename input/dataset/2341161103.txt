We were in Vegas for business and had little time to waste. My wife woke Monday morning quite ill. Our insurance emailed us a list of clinics. Most located in Walgreens or CVS or some other off the norm facility. Had a hard time making an appointment...just a cluster.I saw reviews for a Dr. Logan and thought we would give him a try.My wife was sick with a re-occuring illness that is quite common and knew what treatment she needed. If we had gone with the clinic idea we would have been there all day making arrangements. Instead, we called Dr. Logan. Within 30 minutes we were at the pharmacy picking up her prescription and all is well.My wife was feeling better within hours.
