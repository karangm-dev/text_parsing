I can't stand the green valley location. I've been to the location on Rainbow and was treated with respect. The man that assisted me was professional  and kept me up to date on the progress of my repair. I decided to stop by the green valley location as it's closer to my home to inquire about another repair and the woman that works the front desk was a rude b***! She had the worst attitude. Acted like I was a bother and that my repair was of no interest to her. I got so annoyed I just left. Won't ever come back here. I'll stick with the location on Rainbow. The broad at green valley needs to get over herself and learn some customer service.
