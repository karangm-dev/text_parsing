ok place, but taking away three stars for the following reasons... first off: the line! i was given 1 of the VIP pass things & still had to stand for like a friggin' hour to get in! i guess all that pass does is save you the cover. once inside, i realized you can't even see the DJ! seeing as how that was one of my main goals in going that night that was kinda lame. the DJ is held up in the corner on the top in this glass room in between stairs & the VIP area. which leads me to my last reason for a negative star: the MC Esher layout of this place. sure it's great on an art-level but not a practical one! nothing but levels & stairs! and the bathroom is at the bottom of the maze so you're forced to make you're way around the big Black space. this was tricky for me & i wasn't even wasted- or wearing high-heels! def. an accident-prone environment. anyway i liked that there were many diff. places to get a drink, and the indoor staff were fairly nice, but overall it was just your average nightclub. having heard so much about it i was expecting more.
