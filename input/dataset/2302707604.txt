The retail part of the store is fine. There is a large selection of food and accessories. I like that they carry grain-free dog and cat food. However, their current groomer gave my daughter's dog the worst cut!  The poor thing looks ridiculous! The groomer gave her a poodle cut instead of a shitzu cut. When we picked her up, we heard the groomer yelling at a dog she was grooming!  To top it off, the groomer said she had never heard of a "puppy cut" or a "box dryer."   I think At Your Service got this women off the street!  The sad part was the staff didn't apologize and actually defended this groomer's horrible work. We are now looking for another place to shop.
