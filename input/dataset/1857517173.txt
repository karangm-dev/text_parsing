Great way to learn about the local area.The houses were moved from their original locations, but give you a peak into what the houses of that time might look like.The history in the main museum is really informative too and a place filled with memories for those that lived through the war.Candlelight Wedding Chapel is here with some pictures and clippings of weddings.Old train for those train buffsVery cheap and very informative.Pretty cool.They light it up for christmas, we will have to go back next year as we missed that.
