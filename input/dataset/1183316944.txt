Lang Van has one of the largest menus I've seen in a while. Along with daily specials, there's something for everyone. I had the asparagus dish. Can't remember the name or number but I can remember how it tasted...THE BOMB! It had asparagus, snow peas, onions and zucchini. I added shrimp. I ate it all!!! If I could re-create that sauce at home, I'd be set for life lol. My lunch guest had the sauteed spinach special. It was sauteed spinach and a skewer of shrimp. Didn't seem like much for $14, but she enjoyed it :) Can't wait to get back. So far it's no.1 on my Vietnamese list!
