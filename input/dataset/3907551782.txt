This restaurant's staff is undertrained and there are mistakes on one out of every two orders. If you order to go, and there's any mistakes, management will not credit you. You must drive back to get it corrected. Not cool. Also, for curbside, the order hardly ever ontime and there is no urgency to take care of you. Then the food is cold. I'm done.
