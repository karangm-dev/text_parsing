Needed something to do later afternoon on a trip to Madison and found the Old Sugar distillery on a list of ten things to see while in Madison. Went with a friend and we both had their signature drink very tasty and reasonably priced. They had a very limited food menu, mostly a bar using their own spirits. Great atmosphere and awesome employees. FYI: First time customers get to sample there products. It made for a very good afternoon!! I would recommend this to anyone who needs something to do in Madison 21+ of course.
