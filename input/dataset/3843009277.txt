I had a craving for Hakka, and decided to go to China Palace for lunch. I ordered the lunch special Manchurian chicken with gravy and add egg fried for extra $1.00 and lunch special price was $7.99plus taxes. It comes with a soup which was hot and sour, and it was really tasty with not to much oil. The spring roll was hot and crunchy, but the chicken was not good. First off I reported this to the waiter that the chicken was very mushy and looked under cooked as I saw traces of pink and the chicken was sliding off the fork when trying to cut it in half. He said that's normal because it's dark meat and not white meat. I explained to him that the chicken should t be that colour even if it is dark meat. I ate the rice, and left the chicken, as the last thing j want is food poisoning on the Christmas holidays. Won't come back again.
