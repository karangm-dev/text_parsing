I had the California chicken sandwich and it was very very good. The bread was fresh and soft. The cheese was milky and perfect. The chicken was moist and tasty. The restaurant was clean and the atmosphere was calming. The staff was extremely nice and attentive. Going back again tomorrow, it was that good. I HIGHLY recommend this gem.
