I was starving when I showed up here so I figured anything I ordered would taste good.  I ordered the blueberry pancakes with jalapeno bacon brunch.  On the menu it said that it was served with a basket of fruits and pastries.   I never received my fruits and pastries. When the pancakes arrived I was very disappointed in the COLD BACON.  I mean, COLD.  Could they not even microwave it?  Also, I was not given the option of adding my own syrup, the pancakes were already drowning in syrup.  I don't like that much syrup, but the waitress disappeared, never to be seen again until she dropped off the check later.  There was so much syrup on my pancakes that the top pancake literally disintegrated.  I tried to eat some but it kept triggering my gag reflex.   I ate some of my husband's food, hoping the waitress would come back and I could order something else.  Finally, I gave up and pulled out the middle pancake and ate it because it wasn't quite so wet.  When the waitress finally came back, I complained about the pancakes and she scowled.  She didn't offer to bring me something else, or refund my money, or, I don't know, maybe bring out the pastries and fruit that were promised to me on the menu!  I didn't feel like I had the right to really press the issue because I had already eaten about a third of it.  To add insult to injury, that pile of crap cost me TWENTY DOLLARS.  My husband was embarrassed that he had been talking that place up to me.  It's a week later and I'm still feel nauseated every time I think about those nasty, nasty pancakes and that cold bacon.  There are too many good restaurants in Vegas to put up with crap like this.  SKIP IT!
