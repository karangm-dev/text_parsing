Great find in Toronto! Wish there were more places like this everywhere. Lots of awesome cider choices. Kaleb was very helpful in answering questions, and helping pick out ciders for flights. Got to meet Kyle, the owner as well. Very knowledgeable and friendly. If you find yourself anywhere near cider house, definitely stop in. Cheers!
