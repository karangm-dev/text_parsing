WOW!!! Can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Everything I've tried never fails to amaze me. Where do I start.. So the staff here is outstanding and very friendly! If you have a wait on your order they surprise you with a little something to nosh on, or sometimes a surprise at the end. The drip coffee is excellent, it has a nice nutty flavor.  I've Also tried there rose oil Arnold Palmer. It's like nothing I've ever tired, in a good wayq, refreshing! My favorite item on the menu is the breakfast burrito. Yes I know your at a crepe bar but a crepe plus a burrito(it's the best burrito you'll ever get). I like to get the classic breakfast burrito(bacon) with extra chipotle sea salt on the side, it has the right amount of spice! I usually order a vanilla bean crepe to share it comes with fresh strawberries and I add caramel, it's great to finish with!!  Can't wait for my next visit! This place is closed on Mondays.
