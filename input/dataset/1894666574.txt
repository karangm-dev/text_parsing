This joke of an establishment has taken $230 off my credit card for oxygeneo facials I have pre paid for in the summer.... When I went In to redeem one, the machine wasn't working. I was told my generic facial I received (which was atrocious), would be complimentary and the owner would call me regarding the situation... I never received a call. Fast forward to a few months later, I called to book a new appointment OR receive a refund. It has since been countless calls, 2 messages and 2 emails. All I am wanting to do is book an appointment that has been paid for!!! This "spa" is a scam. The least the receptionist could do is call back and say she doesn't have the authority to help me but will look into the issue.... That is customer service 101. I am waiting a few more days to see if these crooks ever get back to me. I would threaten to report them to the Better Business Bureau... But they probably haven't even heard of the BBB.
