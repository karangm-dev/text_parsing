If I could give a zero star I definitely would. On October 21st, myself, sister, cousin, and two sons went in to the LV store to purchase a duffle bag. When walking towards the back of the store a women's dog leaped out of nowhere and latched on to my son's calf. We were not paying attention to the women with the dog nor did we acknowledge them before the dog decided to attack my son. LV was not sorry and did not even ask us if we needed anything. It was completely UNACCEPTABLE. If a child gets attacked by an animal in your store the LEAST you can do is ask if they need anything and make sure they are okay. The woman was not sorry and proceeded to tell me her dog bit my son because he doesn't like kids. HMM... don't bring your dog to a store if it doesn't like children. It's obviously not a service dog and LV should have asked the woman and her dog to leave the store, but they didn't.  They continued to allow the dog in the store and ignored us. I obviously left without buying anything and will never shop here again. We ended up spending the afternoon in the emergency room to make sure my 5 year old son didn't get an infection. He is now terrified of dogs because this lady and LV have no common sense. I wrote corporate with no response.They are lucky I am not suing or sending a doctor bill, but I would like an apology and the employees to have some kind of consequence for their lack of action. Louis Vuitton is one of my favorite stores, but AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE. Spend your money elsewhere.
