I made an appointment for en elderly client of mine and when we got there, they claimed to not have any record of the appointment. The gal who was supposed to do her pedicure was unavailable and they didn't take into consideration that my client is elderly with limited mobility. I asked when her toes would be dry because I couldn't safely transfer her from the chair she was in with the slippers they put on her and all the lady kept saying to me was that she needed to wear the slippers or her nails would get ruined....This place frustrates me.
