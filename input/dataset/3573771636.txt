Larry and Joe came to my rescue and I thank God for them.  They fit me into their busy schedule and they drove clear across town, heavy traffic and all.  They knew right away what the problem was, fixed it lickety-split and gave me pointers on how to maintain my garage door.  They were such a Godsend because I could have been stranded with a garage door that wouldn't open and they were so nice to boot.  Thank you, thank you Larry and Joe.  I would highly recommend them to anyone who asks me for a garage door repairer.  Even my dog who barks at anyone who comes near the house liked them!  Imagine that!!!!
