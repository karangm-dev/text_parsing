Needed a quick lunch and found this place on Yelp. Don't be afraid of the lack of fancy decor. When I first walked in it looked a little less than inviting but I was p proven wrong as soon at I placed my order.  The gentleman who took my order was very accommodating. I live my life on the low carb diet and I ordered the Bim Bim Bop with no rice and they didn't bat an eye at my request. I usually get some strange looks when I ask for it to be prepared this way. They even offered me an extra Egg!! The woman cooking up the goods in the kitchen was fast on the grill and came out twice to make sure I liked it and that it was prepared correctly. It was delicious, fresh and perfectI will be back!! PS, bathrooms very clean. I don't know about you but that's important to me!!
