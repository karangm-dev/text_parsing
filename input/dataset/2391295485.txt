The art work looked great and the shop was relatively clean looking, but I really can't be sure since we didn't get any service. The people that came in behind my husband and I seemed to get great service tho. I guess they looked more like the clientele the shop was aiming for, broke hipsters. We both have giant back pieces as well as other smaller work and wanted something new but didn't even get eye contact or a hello. Too bad.
