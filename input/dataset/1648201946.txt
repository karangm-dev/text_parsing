If you have a job and aren't currently on parole or dating someone who is,  you will feel out of your element here.   Stay out.   This mall belongs to the hood rats now. It feels like a fight can break out any minute,  and apparently they do.  Car break-ins are frequent here. So if you don't get your car stolen, you run the risk of being shot. Nothing there is worth it.
