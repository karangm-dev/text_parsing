Does anyone have a clue to what happened to EOS at the corner of 44th and Camelback? They were SO happy to take my money last week--yet today they are shut and emptied out!  No notices on the door-nothing.  I'm upset that someone I have done business with for over 3 years just burned me (and MANY others)  I would suppose they wouldn't want to show their faces around town....shame!
