The best shrimp cocktails EVER! I was in Vegas for a weekend and was craving a shrimp cocktail mainly because (hungover) but this place made me feel a live again and although I wasn't feeling to good (the hangover was way to real) he made me smile and feel better suggested a beer to help with the headache and I felt way better when I walked out than when I walked in. I go to Las Vegas at least once every 8weeks. I love this place. I make sure I stop by. Hi fromLA!
