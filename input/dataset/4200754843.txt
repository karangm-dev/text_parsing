I'd been here many times over the years and stopped in yesterday for lunch. It felt like ownership changed since the prior visit and has slipped from an easy 4-5 star review for a few simple things. It used to be kept cleaner. There was cardboard on the floors in the bathroom cut to fit around porcelain, the sink looked dirty, the tables were half blocked off and oddly arranged. It was darker and the nice display wasn't right, like it had all been neglected. I'm a little sad, but if you like cheap lunch-- it's still 6.75$.
