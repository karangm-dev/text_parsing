Burgers were worth it. I got the original and it was so good. Loved the garlic taste and overall  flavor. My husband had the mac and cheese burger which was also yummy. At the end we ordered a cheesecake. OMG. 1 slice was like half a cheesecake and it was topped with chocolate and potatoe chips (heavenly) and pretzles. Sooo good
