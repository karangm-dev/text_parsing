I have purchased two carpets here and went for my third today. The first two worked out just fine. You save a little money by having very limited customer service but it has good variety as long as you are good with looking on your own. Today we found a carpet we wanted and asked the sales guy to come over to price it out. It is an 8x10 and he gave the price, we agreed and then he went to write us up. When we went to pay, I noticed the price was different that the quote from 10 minutes ago by about $40. He said I needed to buy 8x12 instead because they don't have a use for the other 2". Well, neither do I, this was not in the agreed upon price and it is a remnant so they can cut however they want. The bottom line here is that they were not honest and did not honor the direct quote given. Most of all, it feels like they are taking advantage of people by giving a price and then changing it without telling you. Good carpet variety but a lack of integrity and honesty. Maybe it is a new guy but the owner didn't help. Be careful that the price they give is the same when you pay the bill.
