An Apple iPad, iPhone 7, 6+ on down to 1, MacBook Pro and Multiple G machines bedeckecked man drives 50 miles RT to test a new MacBook Pro at this Apple Store. Apple being a formerly favorite high tech company, and the 2 15" machines, plugged in, are sporting battery dead messages.I ask and the guy, an Apple partner, says, yeah the power to the line isn't working.I RUSH out as I feared a moment longer and I'd display my fair version of a Spirit customer of late.I walk away feeing really sorry for Steve and Woz. The fucking power doesn't work...Am I crazy to remotely consider going back?Nope.I won't.
