Most of the team is friendly and helpful and typically do a fair job but there are two issues with this location. 1. The guys who come and harass you because you have a chip in your windshield are complete jerks and need to be fired. They can't take no for an answer and when they finally do they are completely rude and act like dicks. I let these guys "repair" a windshield for me once and they did such a horrible job I had to get the entire windshield replaced a month later. As in sexual consent, no means no - but they don't get that here. 2. I have tried every level or car wash and all of them are pretty much the same. In fact when I pay for the lowest level of wash I've had the best clean done. So save your money.
