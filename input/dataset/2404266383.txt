The Henry Vilas Zoo is a not so hidden gem in Madison.  It's a smaller zoo, but with a great variety of animals.  It's easy to navigate and you are able to see everything is a fairly short period of time, which could be considered good or bad...for our family, it's good! ;)  They offer train rides and carousel rides for $1.50 per person, regardless of age. I think the carousel is worth it...the train, not so much. The train basically goes in a very short loop where you just see the backs of some buildings that you could just as easily walk around. There is a petting zoo and a giant play structure that is fun for older kids. The biggest downfall of the zoo is the lack of parking.  If you are lucky, you will get a spot in the lot, but on busy weekends we've had to park multiple blocks away. I can forgive this little flaw since the zoo itself is FREE.  If you've got a little change to spare, be sure to throw it in the donation buckets located around the zoo. This year on a trip in July we were told they were already out of maps for the year - and there was no budget to print more. Finally, be aware that when they say the zoo closes at 5:00, they really mean 4. The petting zoo, the park, and all exhibits with doors are closed at 4.  They just leave the actual zoo open for another hour while they filter people out.  Don't go at 3:30 and think you will have a full hour and a half to explore or you will be disappointed.
