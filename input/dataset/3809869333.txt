Say what! What place has the best salsa dips before the main entree? Los Cucos of course. We dined here for some appetizing Mexican fare at my 5 year old's request after his preschool graduation. First time here, this place was Mimi's Cafe back in the day. While I am sad to see Mimi go, I am thrilled to have finally tried this restaurant. My family and I loved the salsa and the other green dip made up of sour cream, guacamole, and some other tasty ingredients. Lunch specials are awesome sauce! My hubby and I savored the shrimp quesadillas, my mom had chicken fajitas, my mother and father in law had chimichangas, and my kiddos had chicken quesadillas. The portions are generous and we highly enjoyed our meals. We sat in the enclosed outside area perfect if you have kiddos. The service was great too. Can't wait to go back. OLE!
