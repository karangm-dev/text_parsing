Absolute worst service ever! Took over 10 minutes to get our bar drinks and there was only 4 tables inside. Then when they came they were not the right drinks! Waitress took forever to refill our water. We got the create your own meal and had to find someone who worked there to fill up empty items on the buffet! I had to get up and get our own chopsticks,soy sauce and salt because our server was nowhere to be found.
