To the person who thinks my review was dumb. You must work for them or be related to someone who works there. Abd yes Smiths, ir Albertsons would gladly give me a missing item. They like to keep their loyal customers happy. Im not a dishonest person and if i pay for something i expect it to be in my bag of items when I get home. Im not the one putting the items in the bags the cashier at the store is. The mistake is theirs and the dishonesty is theirs. Stick thus in your pipe and smoke it.  Boy.
