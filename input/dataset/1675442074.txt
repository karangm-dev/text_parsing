*DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE! Horrible experience, much more expensive than others. Will try to trick you any way they can! I mistaken this place as the u-haul store because they have u-haul trucks parked outside and they sale boxes with u-haul logo on them. Not only their boxes are more than two dollar more expensive for each box and it's not refundable. But they also put more boxes on my bill than I actually bought and tried to not give me the receive. I ended up spend $31.46 with 9 boxes(2X-large, 3 Large, 4 Medium). The guy counted the boxes right but put 10 on my bill. If I had noticed it on the spot I would have returned all the boxes!
