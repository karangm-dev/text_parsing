All I can say is wow! This was a special experience. You walk into this small, tranquil little place in Scottsdale with a quiet sushi chef making amazing bites of food. We did the 5 course option, which was plenty of food! We both felt full after dinner. Each course was so delicately prepared with obvious thought behind the combinations. Our waitress was lovely; she explained each dish in detail and instructed us on the recommended way to enjoy each piece. The entire meal was a delight and really felt like a magical experience.
