This is one of the most amazing churches that I have been to and I have checked out several churches they are extremely real they preach the truth with no beating around the bush I respect that very much everyone is super friendly and sweet I went to go see the counselor at the church while going through a really hard time in my life and it helped me so much this church is amazing I definitely recommend it to anyone it's not overwhelming and it's not new age crazy music they have a choir that's amazing as well
