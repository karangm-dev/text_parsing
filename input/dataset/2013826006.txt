First time visiting the IKEA in Charlotte, which was a 3 hour drive from Raleigh, NC! Pulled into the parking lot and was so excited because everyone said I must go! Talk to an associate to understand the layout and concept of the store! WOW, we were amazed at all the things you could buy. Walked back down to the bottom floor and picked up several items that we really wanted to buy! As we started up to the front to pay....BAM..... I thought I was fighting the Black Friday sales! 9 registers open out of twenty something! Got in one line and then the cashier turned off his light! Walked past the next 4 guests in line to tell the other 10 folks In line that he was only taking those 4 and he was closing! Asked for a manager and she was on a register so I walked up to her and she said she had several call offs and she had to even cashier! So who is running the show here if you are on a register! Why is there not an all call to the registers to get people checked out? There were well over 20 customers in each of the 9 opened lanes! WILL NEVER BE BACK! Buy online or don't support an organization that doesn't have a better system or trained staff that can handle this mess!
