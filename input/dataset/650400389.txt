Despite the name, this place is the antithesis of perfect. Crowded, loud, dirty, hurried, horrible service, bland food.I won't go into too much detail but here are the highlights:The waitress glowered at us when we asked for napkins and then didn't bring them and disappeared for the rest of the meal.The chair seat cushions were an indescribable color due to years of grease being spilled by diners.There was a half eaten shrimp under the table. We did not order shrimp and gawd knows how long it had been there.The table next to us got a sizzling platter and it sizzled so much that my friend went into a coughing fit. You see, despite serving and pushing their sizzling platters, there is a definite lack of ventilation. The large vents on the ceiling in fact do not seem to function. I left feeling robbed of my precious youth and optimistic outlook on life!
