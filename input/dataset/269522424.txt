We came to the Gingerbread house decorating event with the twins.  What a great time.  It was nicely organized.  They set the tables in the back and the smaller children had the houses ready to decorate, while the older ones could build them from scratch.  Then they had a table set up with different candies and pretzels and a sample house so you can decide what to do with your house.  The event was amazingly cheap, it was only $10 per child and it included breakfast of eggs, bacon, toast and fruit.  The twins had a blast and enough candy to keep them wired for the rest of the day.  Thank goodness the nanny is coming later.
