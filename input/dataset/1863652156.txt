They have an extensive Vegetarian/Vegan/Gluten Free/Paleo menu and their online tool really allows you to see how their food is prepared and acts as a good guide to determine what fits your needs. The Late Night HH tapas menu is super cheap and a great treat at the end of the day. Highly recommend the hummus trio, black bean burger, and philly chicken pita for those who aren't as GF/Vegan sensitive.
