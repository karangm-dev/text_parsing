They screwed up our delivery and the only way to get the correct order was to come in to the store.  They said that new people messed up the order... Not a good excuse.  Pizza boxes saturated with grease...very gross.  Also delivered to us in the past, but most recent delivery said they won't anymore.  Pretty piss-poor service...look for other options.
