$35 for my wife and I. It took a very long time to get our food. Lots of people behind the counter doing nothing. The sliced brisket taste like it was cooked in the oven, not a smoker. It was about 50% fat. My mac and cheese had no taste and was not even warm, polish sausage was cold. My wife had a stuffed potato with pork which was cold as well.
