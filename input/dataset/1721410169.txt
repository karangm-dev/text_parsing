It took me a while to try this place out since it's always busy, but now I understand why they're always busy.... they're one of the best breakfast spots here in Vegas! The ambiance is a cross between restaurant & a house out in the country. There may be a wait to be seated, but it's definitely worth it. Their muffins are good (free for when you check-i ), biscuit & gravy was good, and the country fried steak was good.Price is reasonable & the service is great!
