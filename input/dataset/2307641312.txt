If you need a place to stay in Vegas, this fits the bill.   It's an older building that has it's glory years behind it.   If you are just looking for a place to sleep a few hours here and there, this is nice.   If you are looking for a room in which you can relax and just rest up, this is not the place for you.   The prices are fair, but the place is getting old.   Expect to take the stairs and the old elevator system just can't keep up with the current demands.
