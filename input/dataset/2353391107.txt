Don't waste your money. I got a 50 minute bamboo massage (which was supposed to be like a hot stone massage but with heated bamboo) and it cost $170 because they helped themselves to tacking on 20% gratuity to the already overpriced $140 massage.Secondly, I would not have minded a male masseuse, but when scheduling the massage the woman at the front desk asked if I preferred a female or a male and I said female. Wouldn't you know - what did I see coming out to greet me for my massage? A duuuuddde. Why ask if you're not even going to get it right? What if I was someone who was serious about preference? Very incompetent.And lastly, their facilities were not even working that day- so if anyone wanted to use their steam room that was just too bad. Spend your money somewhere worth while- their relaxation room, service, and amenities are not even close to worth the money.
