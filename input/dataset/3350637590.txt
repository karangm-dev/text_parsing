B Spot, I'm underwhelmed.For a "burger joint" I get a better burger at my corner dive bar and it is a heck of a lot cheaper.  Das mann says I'm paying for "overhead" (that's restaurant speak) and quite frankly, I don't give a flying fig for "overhead".  I want good food for the $ I spend and I don't feel like I get it at B Spot.B spot is a-la-cart dining.  You order a burger, you get a burger.  You order fries, you get fries.  Upon my last dining experience I ordered the "Lola Burger" which has fried egg and some other goodies on top.  It was mediocre at best.  Note:  Pet Peeve is when I'm asked how I'd like my meat prepared and it isn't cooked appropriately.  It isn't rocket science kids, you throw a meat thermometer in the meat and check the temp, should come out perfectly every time.  And for all the hype Michael Symon gets, I'm shocked that his kitchen's would send out a well-done burger when a medium one was requested.  The fries are "shoe-string" and if you request w/out rosemary they taste like nothing.  B Spot does offer a nice beer selection which does save this review a touch.Honestly, if you want a decent burger, head over to the Oriole on Wed (Half-price burger night) and get a hand-made patty on a bun, a cheap draft & you'll walk out full and spending $10.Sorry kids, but this is not the place to B!
