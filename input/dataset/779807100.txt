Definitely in my top 5 restaurants in Madison! I love the nice selection of seafood combinations and my husband usually chooses one or a combination of their BBQ meats. His favorite is smoked beef brisket or pork ribs. We have even carried out BBQ for a party, and it was a huge hit!! Expect a wait on Saturday nights...but the food is worth the wait!
