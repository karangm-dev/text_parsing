Wow this place is a great value! Their chicken strips are huge with great meat quality. The thing that sets this place about from other chicken strip restaurants- their SAUCES! Unbelievably flavorful. Oh and the fries were an unexpected surprise - some of the best fries anywhere. We live far from centennial, but will be sure to drop by here again whenever we're in the area. Oh and the dine-in service was awesome!
