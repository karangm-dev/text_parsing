This has become my boyfriend's regular Friday-happy-hour-haunt. They have a great beer list, make a great margarita, and we love the food. What really sends this place over the top is the great selection of gluten-free food and beer. We have a friend who is Celiac (real gluten allergy... not the trendy kind), and it's nice to be able to invite him and know he will have options!
