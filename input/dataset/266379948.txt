I had never been to the Mix Shops before the Yelp event, I didn't really get the concept to be honest.  I just thought it was like a mall type of place with nice boutiques instead of mall stores.  Since we were a little early and were waiting for the elevator to go to Canal my husband saw a dress in the window he liked and thought I should try on to kill the 10 minutes we were early by so we went in.   Big mistake! Its basically like a Fred Segal- lots of little boutiques in a walk through type environment.  As I pulled dresses out my husband was brought a beer and got comfortable. (And I was brought champagne....I love shopping with champagne except I'm always nervous I'm going to spill on the merchandise!)  There were three party dresses from one particular boutique (Jennifer Croll and Angel and Wingman, no be surprise there!) that I liked, and they were having 25% off, so I just got all three!  (I have an addiction to party dresses)  I'm so excited to have a place like this, its just what Scottsdale needs.  No having to drive all over the place to go to different boutiques!  You can find anything you need there from casual clothes to party dresses to men's and children's clothes and housewares!  I like to think of it as my new Newbury St.
