the ladies that took my order were nice. i ordered a blackened chicken sandwich and side salad with two ranches. i got one ranch, and the side salad was sooo basic. the blackened chicken was good, but the bacon i ordered on my sandwich was all fat pretty much. i had forgot to order cheese on my sandwich so i asked the ladies for a piece of cheese. they rang me up for it (which i understand) then it took literally 10 minutes for them to hand me the cheese. my food was cold by the time i got the cheese so i just didn't use it. my sandwich came in  a paper basket and i kept getting paper in my mouth cause it was wet from my sandwich. the lady checked on us once to ask if we want refills but that was when we were done eating. i'm really not trying to sound too rude, this place has a lot of potential - step up your flavor in the food and try a little harder. or hire someone else to help out.
