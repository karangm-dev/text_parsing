Bottom line: overall unpleasant atmosphere and waaay expensive. And not inviting to brown folk like myself.I dropped in after seeing the great yelp reviews. There was a kid ahead of me getting his cut while dad watched. The barber has the worst bed side manner. Zero personality and zero friendlyness. The boy's father asked how much for the cut, and the barber said "$25". Jaw dropped (no actual prices listed anywhere, although there are menu prices up; pricing is not clear). And I'm pretty sure this barber treats "tanned" folk like me different. He treated his "non-tanned" clientele much better. Just sayin.
