Skip this place. Drinks are WAYYYYYY overpriced and not good enough (barely any alcohol) in a place with the name "Whiskey" in it. Food is mediocre at best. They served us a frozen peach cobbler in a red hot skillet - that takes some talent, or rather a lack of giving a damn. There are much better alternatives in this airport.
