I have been going to this nail salon for years, as it is close to my home and I used to get great service.  I'm not sure when the current owner took over, but I just had the worst pedicure I've ever experienced.  I decided to get there ten minutes early (and I'm glad I did), because the seven minutes in the chair prior to my pedicure was the most relaxing part of it.  When the girl came over to start, I showed her that I had a cut that was healing on my big toe and to be careful, and within two minutes (while cutting my nails), she hit it and it broke open.  The entire pedicure was over within 15 minutes (and yes, that includes the nail polish drying), and the whole thing felt so rushed that I actually felt worse than when I came in.  I'll mention that the previous time I had gotten a pedicure (about 3 weeks prior), another girl had cut open my foot and it started bleeding.  I should not have gone back, but since I've been going here for years, I gave them the benefit of the doubt (maybe this was her first day) and went back.  I will not be going back again with these owners, and if they want to keep their business, they should take a long, hard look at who they are hiring, and how satisfied their customers are when they leave.
