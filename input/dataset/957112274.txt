Amazing food. We ordered the barbecue sliders, fried pickles and avocado bacon burger with garlic fries. Best food I've eaten in a while. The fries were so delicious!! The burger was amazing!! And the sliders... Yum! Only thing I can complain about is the service. Our food took at least an hour to come out, but I would give this place 5 stars anyways because of the food quality and taste. I think they may have just had an off day or had someone call in...? This place is a bit expensive, but a MUST TRY if you are walking around the Vegas Strip!
