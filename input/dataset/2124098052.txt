What can we say? It's always been the one true home for Rocky Horror in Las Vegas. Ever since Regency took over the place and brought it back from the dead a few years back, the place hasn't looked as good in such a long time. We draw great crowds for our show, the staff has been great, the hot dogs are damn good for a dollar, and you can't beat $1.50 movies (Or $9 for Rocky Horror). Remember, it's the experience of seeing it on a big screen! And thanks to everyone out there who have been coming out to the theater and keeping it going!
