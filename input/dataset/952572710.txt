Used to love this place and was a frequent customer since its very close to where i live. I went today and saw they were under new management. I was worried and went in. We ordered our usual beef pad si ew and chicken fried rice-Portions for both items were about half of what they used to be for the same price.-The pad si ew was too salty-The fried rice was a bit bland. I really did enjoy getting food here. I dont know if I'll be coming back... :(
