I was very excited to try this restaurant and especially to try their version of one of my favorite dishes, chilequiles. I was extremely disappointed. Their chilequiles were basically tortilla chips sprinkled with queso fresco...and cost over $20. The service was poor, none of the dishes we tried were exceptionally good and everything was grossly overpriced. What a sad disappointment.
