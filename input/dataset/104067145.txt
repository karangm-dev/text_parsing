My little one asks me to come to this park daily. She calls it the dinosaur playground....she is actually bugging me about going to the dinosaur playground now which prompt me to write a quick review. The place is cute, clean, nice tall slides and a sand pit so kids can let out their inner archeologist and find the hidden dinosaur bones.  If you don't have a little nugget and want to just enjoy the big grassy fields, pond and waterfalls just be careful and mindful birds poop wherever they please outside of the playground area. Lol, I see many of people yelling how they stepped in something, those geese are big and so is their....you can connect the dots I hope.
