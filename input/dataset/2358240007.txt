I dropped by last night to satisfy a late craving for a panini.  I had the Fontana Chicken panini for the first time.  I tasted a chipotle mayo, chicken, cheese, I don't know what else, but it sure satisfied my craving.  This is going to be my new favorite sandwich at Panera.  I almost made a clean get away, but while I was waiting on my sandwich, the Chocolate Duet with Walnut cookies began calling my name.  They got louder and louder.  Me, not wanting a scene in the restaurant, decided to submit to the call of the Chocolate Duet Walnut cookies and I took home two huge cookies that sort of resembled brownies.  MMM semisweet chocolate chunks with white chocolate chips,  gasp!  I managed to just eat 1/2 of one and freeze the rest for later.  But omg, they were so decadent.  I mean, some things you just don't need to know about.  But once you taste these cookies, the lid is off Pandora's box!  hahaEverything is so great at Panera, what is not to like?  Moderation..........Can't wait to visit and sit outside with a friend!
