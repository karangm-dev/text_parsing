To be honest, I was only impressed by the prime rib.  But a man cannot live on prime rib alone.  Everything else was just meh.  As usual, they have various types of food but there really wasn't that much of a selection at each station.  Price was a couple bucks more than the TI buffet next door which I felt was way better.  Ambiance wise, it felt more like a cafeteria than other buffets I have been to.  The sodas were way watered down too.  I won't be back.
