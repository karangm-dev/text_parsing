We had the following: lemon bar, giant oatmeal cookie, tres leches cupcake, key lime pie, German chocolate cupcake, and 1/2 dozen pecan crumbles. Our total bill was$20, which I thought was very reasonable. Everything looks homemade and fresh! I hate processed looking dessert even if it technically tastes good, so this heightened my expectations for taste. We took the desserts over a friend's house (I'm always looking for a place where I can pick up an amazing last minute dessert as we are not to arrive empty handed, right?), and everyone was very excited to taste the desserts. I am very please to say that everything we purchased was delicious! The key lime pie is tart with a sweet finish (as it should be), so if you don't like tart desserts this is not for you. The lemon bar had a flaky bottom crust...so good! German chocolate cupcake was not too rich and had the perfect amount of icing. The pecan crumbles are practically Mexican wedding cookies, which are my weakness (even gals who don't like pecans tried these and enjoyed them!); I had to stop myself after eating 3. The oatmeal cookie was soft and not overly spiced; plus, it was $1. Finally, the tres leches cake was very good; to make it 5 stars amazing though I felt like it needed fruit to give it some freshness. I am biased because I prefer my own TLC, but I would get it here if I wasn't in the mood to make my own...just would stop off at the store to add some strawberries. This bake shop is definitely a great addition to Anthem and I urge you to try it and keep this delicious business in our neighborhood! I'll be ordering a whole key lime pie for a birthday dinner this week and the hubby is excited to get the coconut pie...I'll let you know how it goes
