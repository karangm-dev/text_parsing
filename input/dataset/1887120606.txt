Fly Allegiant air "where the planes never fly on time!This should be there new mantra.  Allegiant decided to give our plane to another destination.  Thats so nice, no mechanical problems they just needed the plane.  What a way to run an airline.  I opted to save some money and once again i got what i payed for.  A disorganized mess.  Next time ill spend the extra for a ticket on a better more organized airline carrier.  Cheers and  beers! Thankfully their is a nice bar nearby!
