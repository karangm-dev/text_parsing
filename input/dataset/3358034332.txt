I've been to Ramen Hashi 3 times by now. I've been to many different Ramen places before but this is by far my favorite Ramen restaurant because of the clean broth here. As recommended by the chef, I order Shio Ramen with extra menma and Chashu. I really like their clean broth as I don't like thick Ramen broth.  They have complementary ginger unlike most of Ramen restaurants who would charge customers for gingers. (One other Ramen restaurant charged me $0.50 for ginger without even asking me and it was on the bill. Really?) I love spicy food so it was great to have spicy paste condiment that I could add as much as I wanted. Staffs were very attentive and friendly. I asked if they have fried rice that was not on the menu. They actually had fried rice so that was great too. Kitchen is super clean as well. I highly recommend Ramen lovers to try Ramen Hashi.
