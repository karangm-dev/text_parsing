My review is very similar to that of Casey Lyn B: I am American, have rarely had poutine, and this is the only poutine place I've ever been to in Canada. It is, in fact, the only restaurant I have ever been to in Canada (went during a 6-hr Toronto layover), but the bacon+chive poutine was just perfect and everything I wanted. I liked all the components: the fries themselves, the gravy, the cheese curds, and the bacon (it was NOT Canadian bacon but American bacon bits). The name might make it seem like a tourist trap but from looking at the setup, I think it's meant for drunks hungry at 2am. If I lived in Toronto and was drunk at 2am, I would DEFINITELY seek this place out, but I also recommend it to sober tourists on a layover!
