This place is AMAZING. It's German and Russian owned from what I could gander and the sausage, salads and smoked fishes are all homemade right there at the store. You can get take out where they heat the offerings up for you and make a little lunch plate. In fact, I saw quite a few locals come in for lunch and do just that. I wanted to buy one of everything. I was cautioned that these are not loaded with preservatives and that they all were fresh, so ordering smaller quantities, but stopping by more frequently would be a wise decision. The star of the show was the smoked butterfish. I intended to eat it cold with crackers, but I ended up baking it for dinner for my husband and me. It was melt-in-your-mouth fantastic and delicate. I will absolutely be back and I highly recommend.
