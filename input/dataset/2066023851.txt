Excellent customer service. Was able to schedule a manicure and pedicure on short notice and also my friend was able to get a pedicure as a walk in. They were even kind enough to stay late, a half hour past closing time to provide such quality service. I had a phenomenal experience at this nail salon. The nail technician was very careful and honestly was seeking perfection when doing my nails. Also, a great conversationalist! They have a stunning chandelier that changes colors and I just couldn't help but admire the beauty! Honestly, I was scheduled to go to Scottsdale to get my nails done but I wanted something closer to home and it was the best decision! I received quality service and was treated great! They also made sure my friend's first time getting a pedicure was comfortable as possible. It was great because he mentioned over dinner next time we go.. That means he was also interested in coming back too! This is a great west side secret and I will be sure to refer the many people I encounter with in my position and let them know where I got my nails and toes done! I do highly recommended to others! I should have grabbed business cards, as many people I see a day! Anyway, don't go anywhere else. Trust me- I don't always leave phenomenal reviews for other businesses- however when you have one that stands out above and beyond.. Recognize that this is a fabulous place!PS thank you for honoring my request to gel paint my toes to match my nails.. It looks so amazing and the polish will not chip if I have them in heels!A+ and stop reading my review and make an appointment already!!!
