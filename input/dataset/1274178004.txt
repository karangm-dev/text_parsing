D- No GoodMy house was flood damaged. All floors needed replaced, dry wall repairs, entire interior painted, and new base boards. Laminate flooring and tile work looks good but paint job no good. Finish work terrible!  Tried to cut corners hoping we wouldn't catch it. Left the house a mess. I won't hire these guys again nor will I recommend them.
