First and last time at Modern Nails on Union Hills Blvd.  The gentleman who did my fill did a good job, although his supplies, table and the things sitting on the table were grubby.  The pedicure was another matter.  Again, the gentleman was attentive.  But I paid for a callus removal, and the guy used one of those lame Dollar Store implements rather than a proper rasp, which means that the result was about what you would expect. But the real disappointment - which was pure incompetence: I selected a soft pink color from the shellac examples.  The result, which only showed up when the second coat was applied to the nails, was a lurid, tacky bright pink. Turns out that they prepared the "example" with only one coat of shellac, which resulted in a completely different shade. Although I was not charged for their error,  I didn't have time to have the entire shellac process redone so my pedicure looks like it was applied in a house of ill repute. As icing on this disastrous cake, the manager was loud and made sexually and racially suggestive jokes, and they turned off the Arizona State Bowl game while patrons were watching it.
