This place was great. Our server was delightful. He was very helpful on menu selections and did a great job mixing up a variety of drinks for us. We started off with the oysters which were delicious, and shared a salad with an egg in it which was great. I ordered the steak for my meal and my friend ordered the boar, both were delightful. Definitely will be going back again!
