This is the first time I have written a negative review. I am not one to complain often, but this restaurant warrants this review for so many different reasons. To summarizes our experience in one word: disappointing. I took my mom here because she loves Zinc Bistro, by the same chef Matt Carter. This restaurant looked and sounded so amazing, branding itself as "modern Italian". As soon as we walked in the door, we really wanted to like it. It's modern fixtures and buzzing atmosphere seemed promising. However, our table was late and the hostesses were visibly disorganized and loudly discussing issues they were having. Our table was strangely placed near a party so large, we had to move tables in the restaurant during our first course just to hear each other across the table.Sadly, the worst part was the food. We got the mussel antipasta (recommended), the burrata, the Rosso crest di Gallo (pasta) and the rigatoni lamb verde. The mussels were immensely over salted, not fresh at all and the sauce had such a high amount of acid it overpowered anything else in the dish. The burrata was severely under salted, with no vehicle on which to eat it, it was a strange dish. Both the pastas were extremely salty, high in fat and way over cooked. The rigatoni had pickles in it which was very strange. To sum up the atmosphere and food: trying too hard, overdone, confusing.Our one saving grace was our server Mary, who was nice enough to take our pastas off our bill, and did so with genuine sincerity. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, even though it sounds so good. The overall execution of service, food and organization left much to be desired and did not deliver what we expected at all.
