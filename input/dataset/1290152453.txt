We went there for my best friends bachelor party and had an amazing time! Brittany and James were very friendly and took care of us!! I highly recommend it but the only thing i didn't like was that we were told we had all you can drink top shelf liquor which was not completely true...they are mixed drinks. We will be back and thanks a lot again!!!
