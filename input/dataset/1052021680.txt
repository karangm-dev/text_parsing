He's just telling rubbish RE safety , the package was a small envelope , not a big package , this would cause no harm to any UPS driver Second opinion, he wanted to sell me a package of tape, in most UPS stores they are more than willing to place a drop of tape on the label . I think if you owner do not adjust your attitude I will surely will never go back to your store. You have a bad attitude , rememeber Unlike you may think Americans are nit as ignorant as you treat your customer , I saw the last customer before me who was complaining about your attitude as well. I think acting like this will make you lose your business one day . Renemeber unlike you think America is polite not just polite, and have no time for the likes of your attitude. I will never go into your shop again. There are other places who provide the same service with a SMILE . Nit with a Nasty face you make . A drop of tape would have cost you next to nothing , and yes your are allowed to add a drop of tape mr shop keeper.
