First off, I made a reservation for ten of us, knowing it was going to be a busy Sunday morning. When we arrived, the young lady didn't even acknowledge us along with another couple that was also waiting. After waiting a few minutes, an older couple arrived and was helped right away, forgetting that we were in front of her first. Very unprofessional. No smile no customer service. If we didn't have so many people with us we would have left and went to another breakfast joint. Once we sat and ordered, we received our food, which some of the meals were burnt and over fried. I've tried to eat their again just with two of us, and the service again sucked. I will not be giving Rustic Cafe my money again. I will drive further away from home to Ronnie's Cafe for better service.
