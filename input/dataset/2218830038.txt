I just moved from California 2 days ago and I couldn't get into my girl before I left so I was in desperate need of a waxing. I researched a few places before I decided on Pink Cherry Wax. The online booking was quick and easy. Being an aesthetician myself, I am a stickler for cleanliness and proficiency. I have always been loyal to the same person in California so I was a bit nervous before my wax due to the circumstance of being in unfamiliar territory. When I walked in, it was cute, clean and inviting. The receptionist was nice. I had my Brazilian done by Kaitlyn. She was sweet,  professional, clean, quick and efficient. She made me feel very comfortable and minimal discomfort. I am very happy with my wax and I will be back again. Thank you for a great experience.
