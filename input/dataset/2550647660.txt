I wish I could do no star but my experience with HomeJoy has been terrible. I booked them a week and a half ago for a Thursday morning. On Wednesday at 7:40 they cancelled with no replacement. They don't have a reliable system in place for this. I had company coming in and everything. Will never book with them again.
