Terrible service. The women that work here are not friendly at all! Not to mention, they are overly adamant about no picture taking. I was in with my sister dress shopping because our mother was over seas and would not be back until just before the wedding. The lady would not even let me take a picture to send to my own mother! Her reasoning was because we could go make the dress or have someone else make it... Like what the actual hell. I highly recommend NOT going here. Brides and Belles in Reedsburg is where it's at!
