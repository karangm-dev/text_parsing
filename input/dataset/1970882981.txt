ok.. First off this place serves frozen food.  How on earth can you charge that much for frozen food?  2nd the slogan of the restaurant is something about amazing quality... I live for good food so when i saw the sign i rushed in!  What a bummer.. Might as well eat mcdonalds because its the exact same thing they just cook when you order at this place.Dont waste your money eating here.  The people who rated this 5 stars clearly were high when they ate there.... I just wrote the above review and had to edit my review just to come back and say... yuck.  I have a bad taste in my mouth from thinking about this place and am still bitter of the false advertising of quality food.  I wouldnt eat here if someone paid me.  Un believable.  2 stars only because the soda was good. WHY do you serve frozen french fries?????  My taste buds packed up and went on strike after eating here.
