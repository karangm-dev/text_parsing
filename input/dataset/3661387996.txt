I just got finished with my therapy after 4 months.  I have to say that I will  miss Tara and staff greatly.  They helped me through so much.  When I first came in they treated me kindly and professionally.  I truly appreciate all the help and care they gave me.  I will continue to keep exercising at home with what I learned.  Tara & her crew were amazing.  I miss you guys and thank you for taking such great care of me!  Sincerely, Kathy Patterson
