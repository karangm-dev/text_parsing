Dealing with this company has been one of the most grueling and tiring experiences I have ever had.  Forgetting that they were incredibly disorganized upon the check in process but the condo I rented from them did not have functioning air conditioning.  In Las Vegas, no A/C! Upon informing Michelle Pombo of the problem, she repeatedly stated it will be fixed soon, it will be fixed soon, and more lies.  I spent nearly 6 weeks living in this condo with no working air conditioning until I left.  Dealing with her was one of the worst experiences I have ever had in real estate.  She is completely lacking in any semblance of customer care and how her business has been able to remain up and running is well beyond my understanding.  But then again, Donald Trump is a candidate for president so nothing surprises me anymore.  The fridge had a broken shelf, the toaster was broken, there was no usable kitchen garbage can, the jacuzzi tub was uncleaned and shot out an endless stream of dirt and muck from the jets, and there were several other minor problems that should have been corrected prior to move in.  Needless to say, problems always occur in everything in life.  It's how they are dealt with that matters.  This company clearly does not care about problem resolution or their customers and I will never use them again, and in my humble opinion neither should you.
