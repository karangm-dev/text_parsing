Have always had a great experience at this salon! Connie is so helpful and always willing to work with you on price and scheduling. I got 24 inch ombr√© extensions and also a Brazilian blowout to calm my curly hair helping the extensions to blend much better. Great customer service always offering something to drink and willing to work around anyone's schedule. Love ya babe thanks for the hair! Xo
