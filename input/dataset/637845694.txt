Is the service world-class? Not really. At times you can stand there waiting for a table as the staff breezes past you without so much as making eye contact. I honestly don't care. I don't need my butt kissed by the staff. What I do care about is good food and Ping Pang Pong comes through in that department. You'll find many of the American Chinese classics you know and love like sweet and sour pork, as well as traditional favorites like fish stew. Everything is masterfully prepared to order in an open kitchen. It's also inexpensive. Most entrees will only run you a couple bucks more than what you'd pay at Panda Express. In a city filled with good Chinese food, Ping Pang Pong is my favorite.
