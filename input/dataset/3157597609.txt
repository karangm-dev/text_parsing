Man.  Where do I begin? Amazing food, excellent service. I wish it was open till a bit later. I wanted some pupusas to go so my boyfriend and I stopped by. Boy, are we glad we did! It's not a sexy place with candles. Could use a bit of upgrading on the ambiance. But who cares right?! We are here for the food.  Holy moly, was I impressed. We had the Garlic shrimp. It was amazing. The beans were sooo good. My boyfriend had the    Oh man. I could just eat the fried cheese, platanos, beans and handmade chubby tortillas ALL DAY.   We also had the pork and cheese pupusas. They don't have much of a choice in drinks so we had a couple of beers. This place is one of the few local places in Vegas that make me want to go back!  Keep up the good work. For those potions and prices... who needs ambiance?
