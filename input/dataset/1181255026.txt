I picked this restaurant because of great reviews. I was very dissapointed. Received spoiled appetizer (crab with grapefruit), waitress with no hesitation offered a different one. Brought tampanadas that also had a wierd taste ,like old oil or something. Main dish was pretty good (shrimp with scallops). Desert was the best dolce Leche cake with fresh fruit. Service good but food not so much.
