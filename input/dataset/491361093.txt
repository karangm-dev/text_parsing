Great local theater that is not inside a casino, which means you don't have to potentially park 1/4 mile away then zigzag your way through the casino maze just to watch a movie.  This Regal theater shows both main stream and indie films, which is another plus in my book. It is never really crowded on the occasions that I have been there, and the line to purchase movie tickets are rarely long.  Plus, you can buy or print your movie ticket inside at a self-serve kiosk, just in front of the ticket collector.There are also many restaurants in the immeidate vacinity of the theater. Most notably Archi's Thai Restaurant and Bachi Burger (Summerlin branch), which flank the theater.  Round Table Pizza is also just a short walk away, plus a bunch of others that are in the same strip mall.What else can I say, except that it is a neighborhood theater in one of the good parts of town serving local moviegoers.  It is not new or large, but is always kept clean and charges market rate for tickets and food.Parking: 5/5  You may not always get the spaces in the row that is closest to the theater, but your parking space will definitely be closer compared to a casino theather or Rave.Price:  3/5  Market rate.  Not a plus or a minus.  It is what it is.Cleanliness:  4/5  Great, considering the age of the theater.  Plus patrons tend to be more mature (not just age) and respectful, so not a lot of mess for the staff to clean up after each movie.Line/Wait:  4.5/5  Rarely any line to wait in for buying tickets, and if you do have people ahead of you, the line moves pretty quickly.4.5 stars in my opinion
