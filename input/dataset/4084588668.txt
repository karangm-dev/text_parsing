We called around 1pm today, just to see if they have a  table for 9 people. The hostess on the phone said they did when I called and I just needed to get there right after the call. I told her it will take us 10 minutes to get there. I got there within the time she requested only to find the restaurant completely full. The other hostess shifted the blame on her colleague and claimed that the hostess must have told me to wait.   I told her to get me the hostess or manager because they pretty much just tricked 9 Of us to times square for nothing. Please, do not tell us there is actually space when there isn't!
