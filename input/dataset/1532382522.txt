Cardboard! It's been awhile since I've been back to good ol Peter Piper but I can tell you that not much has changed.  Yes the kids love it and I can understand why.  But the pizza still years later still tastes like oven baked cardboard I'm sad to say.  I would give 1 star but its not like its supposed to be expensive gourmet.
