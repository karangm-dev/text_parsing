The staff at Power Road Animal Hospital is awesome! They always treat my Jack Russell Terrier Schooner and I graciously and professionally. Some of their prices are a bit high for my budget, so I tend to take Schooner to the Gilbert Spay Neuter Clinic by my house for his vaccines, but the vets at PRAH are awesome! And they did a fabulous job in August giving Schooner's teeth a good cleaning and taking out a tooth that had started going bad. It was 20% off dental work in August so for about $250, Schooner's teeth got all cleaned up. I had to visit today to find out what Schooner did to his left hind knee. Turns out he tore his ACL. They referred me to Southwest Veterinary Surgical Service so my very active JRT could get a surgery they don't perform there at PRAH. Now to find the funds to get his ACL fixed. I highly recommend this veterinary practice. The vets listen well and explain everything in great detail, respectfully.
