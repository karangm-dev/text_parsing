The food was ok (had bruschetta and the limoncello cake) however, their hours state that they are open until 9 but they close the kitchen at 8 and started putting chairs up at 7:30. One couple walked in thinking they could order dinner and had to leave. Pretty poor business practice for a restaurant. If you want to close earlier, change your hours.
