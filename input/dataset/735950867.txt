I always come to this spot because it's closer to where I live. The employees are usually extremely nice although today I did have an employee who ruined my experience here. I've never seen this customer before her name was breeysi. When I first pulled up to the speaker I asked for a minute, literally 5 seconds later with no guests behind me she asks again, I politely said not yet and she smacked her mouth probably not knowing whether I could hear and seemed upset as if I was taking much of her time. When I get to the window she makes no eye contact nor says a word just my total. Even when taking my card there was no word exchange. Finally when I leave she says "have a nice day" but still no eye contact and shuts the window right away. Just rude customer service. Happily the order was correct but hopefully next time I'll look forward to the other cheerful employe
