The service here was horrible.  The dealer failed to address issues with my vehicle and even tried to convince me that my brakes were supposed to make a loud sound after 5,000 miles.  Also, the car was delivered late with poor communication from the service rep.  They also damaged an accessory in my vehicle and did not offer to replace it or reimburse me.I have been forced to drive all the way to Henderson for decent second, but it's worth it.Just when I was thinking better of this dealership, they cancel a service appointment the morning of because they don't have a promised loaner car!First, most luxury dealerships keep their promises and will get you a rental car when they are out of loaners.  Second, there's just no excuse for canceling 90 minutes before an appointment that was on the books for a long time.
