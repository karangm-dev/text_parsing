Worst Starbucks EVER!!!! The wait time is always crazy here no matter what time they only have one person working, they are always out of the baked goods in particular the cake pops is what i like.... so would not suggest this Starbucks to stop into... unless you have absolutely nothing to do and nowhere to be because you will be waiting.
