My daughter went here for about eight months, and she was unsafe here. She was bit almost every day and the director was not helpful. The classrooms were out of ratio numerous times. Many staff members did not not even know my daughter's name. The staff complained about 16 two year olds and only two adults and not being able to look after everyone.  Don't be fooled by the pretty building.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.
