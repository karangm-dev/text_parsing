I love Poshy Paws and so does my Maltipoo Sparkle! I've taken her to 5 other groomers in the area and this is by far the most affordable and their groomers are the best. My pup comes out exactly the way I tell them I want her to look. That's something I've never said about any of the others. I also like that they don't put her in a cage. I've paid LOTS more in the past and was never this happy.
