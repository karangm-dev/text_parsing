The young lady who checked us out is an awesome human being!!! I told her a cat showed up on our doorstep and we were buying things for the cat even though we didn't know if we could keep her. She immediately pulled out coupons and saved us $15. She truly cared. I will get her name next time I go in. Petco should be proud to have someone of that sincere working there.
