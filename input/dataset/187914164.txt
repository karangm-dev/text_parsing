I payed $245 to fix my iPhone 6 plus. The gentlemen were money hungry individuals and promised me they could fix my phone. They gave me a new lock button which doesn't work anymore and shuts my phone off all day automatically. They gave me a new screen that flickers on and off all day. Do not use these guys. Go to the Apple Store and pay a little bit more and get wayyyyyy better service. It's not worth the hassle in the long term. Now I have to spend another $150 just to get the screen repositioned and a new lock button :/
