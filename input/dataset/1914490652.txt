Just wanted a soda and fries to hold memover. At least 15 cars in drive thru. Parked and went inside. Cash registers down and it was bedlom. The employees were writing down orders on torn off cardboard and using smartphones to calculate the totals. It was complete pandomonium. Here is the best part... my bill was $4.99. I handed them a $10 bill and they had to use a calculator to determine my change. These are the degenerates that Bernie Sanders wants to give $15/hr and free college.
