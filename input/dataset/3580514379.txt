Some of the doctors will do a sales pitch with you and try to provoke fear inside of you to get your animals unnecessary treatment they don't need. You have to really know your shit yourself so you know to take their advice with a grain of salt and only stick to what you know your animal needs. There was a black doctor that took care of us and you could tell that he was lying and not comfortable with it.  I have done work in timeshare sales so I know all about trying to create fear and urgency and all that crap in people and he was trying to do it to me so it was quite amusing.  It's really sad that it's almost impossible to get honest people with integrity to advise you on medical help for yourself and your animal in this country but that's capitalism for you.
