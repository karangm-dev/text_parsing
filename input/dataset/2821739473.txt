This milestones is near the movie theatre just outside of scarborough town centre. Lots of parking due to the mall being right there, looks like any other milestones from the outside. Upon entering, there was no greeter and when the greeter finally came, she was not really a bubbly or cheery person. After being brought to our table, it took forever for the server to come. Everything from here wasn't too bad, we order an appetizer to start - the baked goat cheese. Wasn't that great... Anyways, onto the entr√©es - my girlfriend ordered a pasta and for myself, a burger. The pasta was average, nothing special. Burgers like the one I ordered can be compared to ones like at moxies or pickle barrel because they're just a burger with a fancy name cooked well done and with a side, except this one tasted terrible. I don't know who thought some sliced smoked ham would taste good in a burger - terrible combination.The only thing that was a little more than decent was the server refilled my drink quickly.2.5/5
