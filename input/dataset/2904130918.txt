Been wanting to get my teeth whitened for a while now.  Tried strips in the past but it didn't work all that well.  So I thought I would give True Teeth Whitening a try cause they said they use a FDA approved product that is also all natural.   I must admit I didn't expect the results to be as good as they were.  I was very happily surprised.  I am aware that results maybe be different for different people but for me it was a huge difference.   The place was clean and they were very professional.  The process was simple and easy.  Only hard part was laying down with you mouth open.
