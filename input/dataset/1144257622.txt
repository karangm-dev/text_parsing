I came in a week before my wedding to make an appointment for me and my bridesmaids. I let them know how many people and what services we wanted. I also asked her if she could place me with someone who could do great designs. (I really wanted my nails to look good for my wedding day). So we come in the day before my wedding and somehow for whatever reason they place me the bride with the grumpiest nail technician guy in the place.  He was annoyed from the beginning because I wanted a design, then he was mad because I took 2 extra minutes to pick out a base color. Then it really escalated when I explained the shape and length I preferred for my nails. I have no idea what this guy's deal was but every word he said to me was with a rude loud tone to the point my bridesmaids noticed from across the room and had to step in to help me out. Thank god another technician caught on and came over to finish the job. I was having a great day right before my wedding until I came into this place. Sadly I left with nails I didn't care for or want for my wedding day with no time to run out and have them fixed. I recommend this place be a little nicer and take care of your guests better. Especially the brides that are bringing you in business.
