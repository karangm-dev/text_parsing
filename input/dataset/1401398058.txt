I am all about supporting small business, but not after this horrible experience.  The automatic wash tore off 2 of my tire valve stems off my 2015 Infiniti SUV...$500 to repair.  I got one flat tire immediately.  The 2nd flat occurred a few days later.  The employees were great and immediately changed the 1st flat, so I could drive to the dealer for repair.  I requested the owner's phone number, so I could call and discuss the damage.  The employees gave me the number and chuckled while saying "Good luck...he won't call you back!"  The employees were right.  I called multiple times and the owner has never called me back.  It was an expensive car wash!  I will not be going back to this business.  I would give ZERO stars if it were an option.
