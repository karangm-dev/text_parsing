If I could give negative stars I would. I have been coming to this Cosmo Prof for years and everyone has always been so nice and helpful. Apparently they have new management and the assistant manager, I think her name is Kassandra? Is extremely rude. She obviously doesn't like her job and it shows. Me and another lady in the store had children with us and you could instantly tell that it bothered her. Kassandra walked near me and I heard a give a huge sigh. When we were checking out she was being rude to me and I told her that I could tell that she was annoyed and heard her sigh and she denied it. I guess they cleaned house with their old employees but it's a shame because they were always so nice and welcoming. I never want to go to this location again. Kassandra- I hope you have a better day tomorrow.
