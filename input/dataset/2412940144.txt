Very authentic Mediterranean cuisine. We got the meat platter which was delicious and we split it.  With the groupon, it was a great deal of $22 for $40 worth of food. Very authentic Middle Eastern spices and the restaurant had a really neat decor. The manager was the nicest! My mom was cold and he brought her his mother's shawl to keep her warm. We chatted with the manager after he introduced himself  and he is doing a great job! Very nice individual!  I loved the feeling that I was going to neighborhood restaurant and getting to know the manager.
