I bought a cake from Las Vegas Cakes on Charleston.  Vanilla cake with chocolate  butter cream... who puts chocolate  sprinkles in white butter cream ????. cake was good. I asked for a 2019 Corvett  the girl did a good job. detailed.  no shine to the car or cake. (dull) . I paid 226.00 for a  8 inch round cake...I am so disgusted . I was sending my daughter  but, decided to go  else where. ....
