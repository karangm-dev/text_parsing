We needed some grounding, warm, nourishing food after a long drive and this place hit the spot! It was pretty quiet (which we loved) and our food came out promptly. The smells are enticing! We were checked on by our waiters consistently and our waters were never less than half full. My husband got a lamb dish and the lamb was tender and flavorful. I got a vegetarian dish with peas (forgot the name) that hit the spot. Lots of flavor and spices but not so spicy that you can't even taste your food. A wonderful find, we will definitely return!
