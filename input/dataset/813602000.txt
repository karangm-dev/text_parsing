Absolutely horrible Vet $$$$ signs are their business.  They had my dog hooked up to an IV when luckily I pulled him out and took him to a Vet that saved his life. He would have died there. Please please take your business elsewhere. Also I was threatened with a lawsuit for writing a bad review on them. They also found a way to remove the review. If you can't take the heat get out of the kitchen. I have also contacted the BBB and taken it to any social media possible! I can't stress enough not to go there if you care about your animal.  As an added plus my puppy needed tons more care including surgery and the bill was less than one tooth extraction quoted at their office!  Horrible and scary
