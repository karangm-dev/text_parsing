By far one of the worst Doctor's offices I've ever been to. If I could give a ZERO star I would, from the front office staff to the back office staff. This was my first encounter with a neurology office and I so happened to pick the worst one. My first appointment with "Dr. AJ" went so fast I don't even remember what was said at the appointment. I had no chance to ask any questions yet alone discuss my concerns. It's been over a month and I'm still continuously having back pain that I've called his office about on several occasions (which it takes his staff 2 weeks to give you a call back for anything). I had my EEG test scheduled a few days ago even showed up early because they take FOREVER to do anything, only to walk out because the lady at the front desk was first off rude and had an I don't care attitude as if she didn't like her job. She had the worst attitude I've ever seen. I told her I had another appointment scheduled so I needed to be out of here and all she said was "I can't predict how long he's going to take" not even an apology after I had been sitting in the waiting room for over and hour. This was my last straw with these people and I will not be returning as a patient. Don't come to this place!! Terrible service
