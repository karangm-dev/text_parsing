Once again clear protection is horrible when it comes to customer service!! Besides having no techs in my area and having to buy 3 new sensors and install them myself and call them to install in my system and install new batteries in a door sensor and motion detector I was call last Friday when I was out of town that the overhead garage door sensor alarmed.  It was false so I call Monday and told my story to Stephanie who said she would call back with info but she went home at 4 pm without calling me back with answers!  Anyone looking for alarm company make sure they have support in your area and in Bakersfield don't use Clear Protection because they don't stand by their products or word!!
