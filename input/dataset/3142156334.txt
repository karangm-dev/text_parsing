We were invited to go back to Guy Fieri restaurant since we had a bad experience on our first visit.  Well Guy Fieri all I can say is what a difference it was to have Adrian as our waiter. He listened, took care of us, picked up on a mistake with our appetizer  before it reached our table since I'm a vegetarian. Michael the manager was fantastic. Stephanie out did herself. The Guava Margaritas were out of this world. My husband had the roast beef with all different kinds of fries which he said were delicious. My vegetarian salad  with tilapia was to die for. Let's not forget the fried ice cream Oh my God it's  amazing. Good food, generous portions & reasonable prices.Aida & Carmine S
