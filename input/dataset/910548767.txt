Came here about two weeks ago I know I'm late. I'm rating casanova a 2. 1 start for the tasty food & the other for the location & decor of this small restaurant. Otherwise the waiter didn't acknowledge us most of the time, the food came out wrong, we waited about 25 min for our order which is ridiculous for 4 pastas & a restaurant with about 30 tables. When we asked to speak to the manager he took our complaint as a joke. We will never return & I don't recommend it either unless you don't mind putting up with that crap.
