Been here before, and the food wasn't bad til today. My chicken fried steak was burnt, and so was my sisters. What topped it off today was my brother found an ant in his potatoes. We told a waitress name Bridget (wasn't our waitress but she was the first one we saw), and this is what she had to say, "Unfortunately there is so many bugs in this world, and one happen to land in your potatoes." It was an ant, not a bug that "landed" in his potatoes. We weren't expecting that type of response. Anyway, needless to say we won't be back. The food today was burnt, and had a bug in it. The service today by Linda was good. She was nice, and very apologetic.  Bridget, and the girl the brought out the food on the other hand may need a little more training on customer service.
