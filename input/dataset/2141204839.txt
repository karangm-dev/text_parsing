We love Paul! My wife lucy has been going to Paul for her hair care for five years now. We were very lucky to find him as we moved to Las Vegas in 2012. She is in the entertainment business and Paul makes her look as beautiful as she can be. Very Important! The extensions that he gets are the finest quality. ( last batch were 24 inch blond )The work that he does is top notch and we are very pleased! It looks like My wifes own hair as I stand 12 inches away and look at it. His coloring is spot on perfect. Paul is a total professional and we recomment him to any and all! And yes we still drive to vegas from Southern California now for him to do her hair. Thanks Paul. Your the best!
