Wow, what can I say about this place. I was looking for a place to eat and I found this place on what other place then Yelp! There's plenty of parking at this location and it was packed at all when we went around 12p. The restaurant has a nice ambiance too it. I really liked the look of the place. The staff is nice and I really liked how the chef came out and talked to some of the customers. To me, that means a lot for a chef to come out of the Kitchen. The pricing ranges from $9 to about $25. The food is amazing here. I ordered the burger with pork belly on top with potatoes and it was ONO! I had to cut it in half or it was too big for me to eat. The beef patty was very juicy and tender and everything just went well together. Here's the link to there website.http://servedlv.comAgain, If you're ever in the area, go check this place out! I wish we had Served in Hawaii.
