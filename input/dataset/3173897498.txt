I was interested in buying a daily meal replacement  I could do at home so I went in to the OSN to get more information. I bought a shake and asked the guy at the front if I could buy the ingredients in the shake I had bought, He replied no... so again I explained I wanted to buy product to make shakes at home. He then said they only sell the flavoring for the shakes. I have been to the 44th location tons of times and the gentlemen that works there had told me they do sell the product- but to double check I called and asked again after leaving the Ahwatukee location (which the question was yes of course they sell the ingredients  for the shakes) I'm thinking because there was like four people working/hanging out in thereHe didn't want to help me.l and continue his convo with the others. Not sure why they need four people on staff when it's slow and none of them are looking to do there jobs.
