I would give 0 stars if I could. This was my first time visiting Lon's. I'm a professional cake decorator and brought a cake I made for a friend's birthday. When asking for plates and silverware for the cake I was asked by, Brett, our waiter if I also brought our steaks. Then he proceeded to ask if I had called ahead about the cake. I guess he noticed our confused looks on our faces and he rushes off with the cake saying he'll take care of it. Little did they know that my New Yorker boyfriend was a text away. At the end of our night with them, because of the call he received by said boyfriend, the manager came to apologize for the disrespectful comment and to inform us that they have a $12 cake cutting fee. I had no problem that there was a fee to begin with. You would have thought they would have waived that for the ill treatment we received. I'm guessing they were all insulted by the AJ's cake box I brought it in. I ran out of boxes and was in a rush. This is the first and only time I will ever be at Lon's. Never have I been so rudely treated at a restaurant before. I will not recommend them to others.
