First...the food is great, every time; however, tonight the staff and restaurant were shameful. Long story short, the restaurant has no screens to block the hot afternoon sun from turning the place into a heat box. Chain reaction, the AC couldn't keep the place cool, and thus the ice machines ran dry as they couldnt produce ice. So, what did the staff (there was no manager in sight) do?  One said, "we should probably send someone to get some ice at circle K" when I asked if he knew that not only was their machine empty, but that the beverages served were warm (note that in the time i waited for my food, no one came with or went to get ice. None of the staff said, "oh I'm sorry. Our machine is out of ice and not chilling the beverages in the fountain either", as people were ordering a drink. And none of them offered an alterative, either.Poor staff training, lack of skilled management, and a facility incapable of operating correctly on a hot summer day...hmm, I know we've had a few of these already this summer. How can this be?Wake up owner.
