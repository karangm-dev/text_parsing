Stop by here for dinner. We ordered the roast duck and wonton noodle soup, soya sauce chicken and BBQ pork over rice, and Singapore noodle. Singapore noodle was ok, but found the curry wasn't mixed well, portion was spicier than other. The noodle soup and rice was decent. Service was typical, server was little pushy in taking our order. I would stick with the BBQ items here.
