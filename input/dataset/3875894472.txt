So very sad.  I was taken.  Please be careful when buying something here.  Do not let them pack your merchandise.  He said it was fine as he placed my statue in my trunk while I gave him many towels and pillow to assist him in his packing...and my statue's head broke off.  I called immediately and asked for at least 30 percent off if not entire exchange and he refused.  He said once it leaves the store he is not responsible unless he delivered it.  I was not offered a delivery and he offered to pack it.  TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE customer service let alone UNETHICAL.  I will fix her, but I have to pay more money for the glue.  He won't even compensate me for this.  So sad and so shameful.  Karma, Karma, Karma.
