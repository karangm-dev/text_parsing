What a terrific unique place. This is truly authentic to Latin food and reminds me of a few places in Mexico. The menu has a variety of items and range from ceviche, salads, fruit bowls, ice cream, etc. stopped in to get a popsicle for my daughter and can't wait to go back and try more on the menu. I had to order the Sandia Loca after seeing the picture and am so glad I did. The orders do take 10-15 min to make since its all fresh but that wasn't a problem at all.
