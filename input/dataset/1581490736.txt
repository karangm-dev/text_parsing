I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in a Korean BBQ establishment before as I was with this place. First of all, the servers took forever to come take our orders and I thought it was a bit ridiculous that if one of us wanted to order the veggies, we all had to order it as well. Secondly, the grill that my friend and I were sharing wasn't working properly and it took them over half an hour to come fix/replace it. Oh, and if we wanted to order more side dishes or drinks, we had to literally wave and yell a server to come to our table.The food is subpar. Veggies were dry and wilted. The fish smelled a bit funny and the meats were overly seasoned.To top it off, the route to the bathroom consisted of passing by meat just literally sitting in buckets of blood. I was so grossed out!All in all, a pretty bad experience to say the least. Don't think I'll be going there again.Ps, if you don't have cash or credit, don't even think of going into the place.
