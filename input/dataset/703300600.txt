Old school 80s art deco red and black lacquer decor.  Reminds me of Red Velvet and 80s new wave.  Friendly and good service by Shawn.  "Prime" 16 oz rib eye - I doubt this was prime.  Very chewy and almost no flavor."45 day dry aged" bone in - usda choice people.... NOT prime cut.    Lobster - goodFries - decentMushrooms - fineSalads - goodMac and cheese - utter flavorless garbage.  Probably the worst thing we ate all night.  I think Shawn did us solid though and kept it off the bill.Our friends said the food used to be much better.  I wouldn't recommend you eat here.  I agree with other reviewers, you have so many better options at Las Vegas.  Cannot believe what you get served for the price.
