First time at this place, it had so many sandwich choices, I had trouble deciding which one to choose. I ended up choosing the Michael Keaton sandwich with fries, it was hot and very tasty! Homemade brownie was great! Service was fast and friendly! The girl working up front was really nice, she gets an A+ for customer service.
