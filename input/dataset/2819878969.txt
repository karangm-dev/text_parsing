MY friends really wanted to go, and we've been going to the places I wanted to go, so I had to compromise and go.We had to wait about 10 minutes, finally when we got seated, we were placed right by the damn stage, which is where the loud speakers are at, and where the house band plays at.  It was so damn loud we couldn't even have a conversation, we were hungry, quiet and waiting for the waitress to bring us our waters.We all ordered different things, and when we got them, the food was "ok" and they weren't even hot,  just warm.  Finally the service was slow.I would come back to this place, but I will never eat here.   Maybe a night of drinnkkin at the bar singing bad country songs. (since they mostly play the new poppy crap).
