I have been going to this place since it opened in its old location in the 80's. We always get awesome service (better than most other restaurants) & the food is awesome. The chips & salsa are great & they serve bean dip with the chips as well. I love the soup which is served with most dinners as well. If you're looking for excellent Mexican food on the west side of town, this is the place.
