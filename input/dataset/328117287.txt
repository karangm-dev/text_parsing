We went here with the intention of buying a new van. Point blank - The dealership was a zoo. Test drove a van but then hubby started to consider an Accord. The Sales Manager went from being our best friend to just walking away from us when the potential sale $$'s dropped. The salesman proceeded to tell us his opinion of our other car (VW Jetta) and he was extremely unprofessional. We were 18 year customers of Trickett Honda in Nashville TN and only drove Hondas for many, many years. This dealership is an embarrassment to the Honda brand.
