This right here is some goooooood tex-mex food. Probably my favorite in Charlotte. Who am I kidding, definitely my favorite in Charlotte. They have a very small outdoor patio (3 or 4 tables). There is literally always a wait here so come early or plan ahead with a reservation. Food has tons of flavor and is prepared perfectly.
