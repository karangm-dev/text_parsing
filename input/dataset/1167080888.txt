If you're looking for a clean, safe and friendly storage place, then Security Self Storage is the place for you.  For a couple of months I rented 2 indoor and 1 outdoor unit. The indoor units were in a temperature controlled building that was very clean.  If other renters were also in the building there are 3 doors I could choose from, so gaining access to my unit wasn't a problem.The outdoor unit was very clean. The roads are wide enough to provide enough space to park your vehicle to load / unload while still letting other traffic to go past.Another thing they provide is a FREE truck rental if you're within a certain distance from the rental unit. It'll save some money if you're in the right location and need to move things to your unit.  If you're hiring movers they should have no problem getting through the security gates. I hired movers with a gigantic moving truck and they were able to pull through the gates without a problem. But ultimate what kept me happy was the extremely friendly staff. I was in a hurry and needed paper work quickly so I called ahead and they accommodated me by getting the paperwork ready for me to sign when I arrived. Fantastic staff, no fuss, very professional and superbly friendly.  So if you're in the market for a storage unit, pop on by and their staff will help you find exactly what suits your needs.
