I understand Las Vegas is over-priced.  But $50 for a pitcher of mediocre sangria - more than 1/2 way filled with ice - with not a slice of fruit in sight?  ANNOYING.  Friendly staff.  My food (fish tacos) was not nearly as good as the time I had it before.  It is conveniently located very close to the convention center so it gets packed when events are going on.
