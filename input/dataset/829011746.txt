Let me preface this by saying that I normally do not leave negative reviews. I am an extremely laid back person who tries to find the good in every situation or person.  That being said,  here is my review: This is the only Baja Fresh location I have been to, and let me just say, the customer service leaves A LOT to be desired. The food is ok, I prefer Rubios, but every time I come here, the staff seems just miserable to be here. The girl working the counter today did not greet me for 3-5 minutes, she just stood in front of the register staring at her phone. She did not ask me if I had any questions, and no matter how personable I was,  I could not dredge up a smile from her! This is the treatment I get every time I come here,  no matter who is working, and this will be the last time I eat at this location. For overpriced and underserved food/portions, the least I would expect is good customer service,  or ANY level of customer service. Again,  I don't normally leave negative reviews,  but I truly feel the owner of this franchise needs to be aware of how his employees are representing his brand.
