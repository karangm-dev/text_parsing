We had visited the original Carolinas a couple of times before and always had great service and delicious food. Today we visited at the Cactus location. Tables were clean and inside looked nice. However, our food arrived cold. Maricopa Dept of Health should definitely stop by his location to test temperature of food that is suppose to be kept at a certain temperature like meat, chicken, fish, eggs, dairy:0!!! The tortillas weren't warmed  and chips tasted old and stale. Manager Vanessa was very unprofessional when we expressed our concerns. This is a one and done for us. We will visit he original location from now on.
