For anywhere, USA, a fine buffet. For Las Vegas, I've experienced better. It is only $18 per person, which is about 25-50% less than other buffets. But the food selection is not as expensive or as good tasting as other buffets in the area.We went for lunch. I did like the hummus and the egg drop soup. I would suggest forgoing the gnocchi pasta.The dessert area was the best part because we got unlimited cotton candy, which was awesome. The pastry chef was real nice too.
