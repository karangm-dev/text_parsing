2 Pork Shao Lung Boa - 16.001 Shiu Mai - 9.001 Snow Pea Leaf - 28.00  ==  Yes Twenty Eight1 Iced Tea - 4.50Total Lunch (Not Including Tax) $62.16MSG bomb all over.Most chinese ppl would find this restaurant offensive.  I only ate here b/c I saw Mr Wynn himself eating lunch here.  I wouldn't come back.  They also have a terrible service issue.   More specifically, the servers standing there.  Not servicing the customers.  No need to bring your own soy sauce...food's salty enough.
