Delicious! Came here today and tried the Oreo Matcha Bingsu, Mochi Bingsu, and the Red Bean Sticky Rice Cake Toast. They were all well made and a fair portion for the price. The mochi was just chewy enough and paired well with the soybean powder and red bean. They gave a generous amount of Oreo crumbs for the Bingsu and topped it with a dollop of match ice cream. The toast was also surprisingly very good, since many places focused on snow ice or similar desserts can be lacking in other areas. It was filled with mochi, red bean and honey. The atmosphere is also quite comfortable and cozy with an Instagram picture worthy backdrop at the back of the store. Highly recommended!
