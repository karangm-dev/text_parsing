Rule #1 in this article applies to me and why I will never return to this studio (see bottom of post). I was trying to heal from a back injury, but wanting to do Bikram yoga again, I bought a temporary pass at this studio to see how I would do. I wanted to take it easy so as not to reinjure my back. After all, It took me over a year to heal. I explained, disclosed that I would go at my own pace and that I may not do some of the forms. They acknowledged my request and I reminded the instructors of it each time I took a class. However, to my disappointment, on two separate occasions and with two different instructors, I was singled out in class. In these two different classes, my instructors wanted to show me proper form and then proceeded to instruct me to do an aggressive (for me at the time) posture of which I was not ready for. I exclaimed that it hurt too much and they still proceeded to instruct me! Feeling embarrassed and pressured, I tried it. Now, I am back to seeing my neuro doctor and starting from square one. Perhaps the studio instructors could learn a bit by taking a dose of instruction themselves. It is our own practice after all and don't let them tell you otherwise.
