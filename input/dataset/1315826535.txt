Yes, this IS as good as it gets!  Dr. Dameron and his team make going to the dentist actually a really good experience!  The whole staff is very professional, kind and accommodating.  Not to mention HAPPY!  The hygienists are just the best, as are all the staff.  Dr. Dameron's work is beautifully done and my teeth have never looked or felt better.  I HIGHLY recommend this whole office to anyone needing work done!  You will not be disappointed.
