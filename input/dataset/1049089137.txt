I am little disappointed at the cleanliness of this movie theater since the last time I visited. I was so excited to see my movie and stay local to my area for evening movie. The movie itself was great but the movie theater was not in best condition. I do understand that this location does get a lot of business due to it being right off Mill Ave,but I believe if they cleaned through the day it would have presented better at night. The women's bathroom upstairs  looked as if it not been cleaned all day. There was no toilet paper in most of the stalls and most of stalls were dirty with toilet paper all over floor. I was going to report this issue to guest services but there was only one guy selling tickets at the time I was leaving so I just left. I must say I am so disappointed and will maybe next time drive to another location for my next movie.
