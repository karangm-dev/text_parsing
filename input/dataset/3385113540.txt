This was hands down the worst mani/pedi I have ever had. 2.5 hours - did not know what she was doing. My feet were left rough, my hands were dry, she did not do my cuticles properly, she did not know how to apply gel Polish so she put layer after layer - they are dull and ugly. Nails are not even and were not shaped properly. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. STAY AWAY!!!!
