Terrible customer service with uncompetitive prices. They tell you to bring your car in for service, then when you drive to get there, they tell you that they don't have time to see you. On top of that, they are rude and overpriced. A simple  synthetic oil change and tire rotation is $40 more here than anywhere else in the area. Do yourself a favor and drive a few minutes into Harrisburg and go to Pepboys.
