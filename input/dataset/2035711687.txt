THIS REVIEW IS FOR A TAKE HOME ORDER.My significant other was at this establishment for a work function. I asked him to bring me back an order, since he was having dinner there. (why cook when he already ate?) I had him order the spaghetti with meat sauce. I was stoked for him to arrive home. I immediately fixed a bowl full of spaghetti. I ended up eating it because I knew I needed to eat, since I skipped lunch. :( It was still hot (coming from the west side of town, to the east), but I've had better. I guess I'll have to tough it out and finish the order over the next two days. I hate wasting food, especially at that price.The portion size was pretty generous. It came with a big portion of salad, and a bag of some bread. The bread wasn't too great, which could have been due to the time it spent out. (a little hard on the outside, and a tad too chewy on the inside. Not a great combo). I wonder if the pizza would have been a better choice. But for the take out order of spaghetti with meat sauce, I was not impressed. It lacked great flavour/taste. It tasted generic. For a small chain, I expected better. Nothing beats home made spaghetti, but when dining out, my favourite ones are from Buca di Beppo and Olive Garden.
