The place itself is really cute and the ambiance is just right- however, the wine is questionable and the food is not great. I explained that I am primarily vegetarian, although I eat some fish on occasion. They recommended a salad on the menu and when I got it, it had bacon- that was not cool. I could not stand to see the pigs body thrown in the trash, so I ate it- but it was not good and I did not feel good afterwards.
