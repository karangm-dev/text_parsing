Love this little liquor store. Close to the house. Excellent customer service, and I love that its a family owned small business. I come here about 3-4 times a week average (bc I have a drinking problem. haha) I just never check in bc I forget. So far, they usually have the stuff I need.. lots of wine, beer, vodka,  mixers... you name it. If they dont have something, just ask. My brother in law wanted a certain beer which they didnt have and the owner specially ordered it for him. And now he always has his beer in stock. This owner really cares about keeping his customers happy... which keeps us loyal! Enjoy!
