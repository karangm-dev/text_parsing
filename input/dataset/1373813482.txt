Hands down top notch drinks crafted before your eyes. Great space for a date or to enjoy with friends. Booths are avail amongst plenty of bar seating. Loved the decor! See if you can spot all the Gremlins that are hidden around the bar =xtra cool. Even the bathroom is decked out in Wu-Tang and hip hop flyers.1st time here so I asked bartender Sally for her recommendation of a gin based cocktail. She created an elixir -off menu- that should be the establishment's highlighted drink! It was infused with cucumber and was mind blowing.If your are in the neighborhood give this place a try it won't dissapoint.
