Horrible place. Young kids who play around, don't listen, continually messing up on orders then give you attitude.  The manager on duty...despite her age...as playful with much colorful language and allows her employees to carry on. Playing in the back while we wait for someone to bless us with their presence to take our order. Lobby is always full of kids loitering around and often staff are hanging out with them. Facility has always been dirty, tables never wipe all (all of them had to leave because no clean table) very questionable activity outside at the parking lot with employees and customers. We stop going and will not return. Go to Another taco bell most of the rest doesn't have this problem.
