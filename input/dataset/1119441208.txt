Really enjoyed the food here. We have been here twice dined in once and took togo order the second time.  Both times were good . We tried the pulled chicken pulled pork rib tips ribs baked potato the corn muffins potato salad and side of pickles. Loved it all . Just wish the corn muffins were warm and are kind of dry. Good to have some good bbq up in this part of henderson.
