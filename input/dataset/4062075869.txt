The wife and I decided to give this place a go last night for a nice fun and inexpensive date. We had not visited since the location moved to the much more spacious and easy to get to location. We arrived fairly early for a Friday night, but the place was already hopping with what appeared to be two birthday parties (one for a teenage hipster, and one for an adult hipster - we knew as the teenage hipsters had the faux mustaches and the adult hipsters had the real ones). We put $20 in the change machine and proceeded to have about 2.5 hours of fun. You cannot really beat that anywhere.The PHOF has mostly pinball, but also some other video games and machines. I love coming here because they have the two games that I used to love playing as a kid...Addams Family Pinball and Simpsons Bowling. I could probably go for the Addams Family Pinball game all night long.This placer really is a gem. I cannot say much more that other reviewers have already said. I love that the owners of this establishment donate to charity and that they provide a safe atmosphere for kids of all ages. This is a wonderful place for a date, or to bring out of towners.
