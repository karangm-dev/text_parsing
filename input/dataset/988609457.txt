Helpful, friendly and healthy. The Bloor West Rowe farms team is fantastic and go out of their way to make it easier to give our family great meat - whether by ensuring that a standing order is always ready, suggesting something new or bailing me out when raccoons broke in and stole our thanksgiving turkey (yes really). While there are lots of butchers in Bloor West, Rowe really is different and well worth a little extra for the service and the quality.
