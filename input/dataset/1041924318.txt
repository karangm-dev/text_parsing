I began using the East Parking area when I would travel a lot for work. Now that I don't travel for work, I do travel a bit for pleasure. I always opt for the parking garage (B). My car is in a covered area, close to the Sky Train and to the 202. I am in charge of getting my car and getting home. I don't have to wait for a bus to pick me up and take me somewhere of site. I always advise people to use Sky Harbor Parking.
