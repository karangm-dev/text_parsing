Service : 1.5 / 5Environment : 2.5 / 5Food & Drinks : 3 /5Price : 3 / 5Overall : 10 / 20Comments- BBQ Pork is a definitely "must-try" here, its pretty darn amazing. - Service is mediocre | Manager was good, but the rest was just un-enthusiastic, un-willing to work/move. - Food came out in batches, making a full a 9 course dinner service kind of odd | took them roughly 45 minutes to service all 9 dishes.
