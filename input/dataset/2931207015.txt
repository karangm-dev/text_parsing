For food court noodles, this place is a tad more expensive than Chinatown restaurants! However the noodles and soup are delicious and totally worth the trek to this gloomy food court!Service is fast and extremely friendly. They take AMEX!!!! The chef will make your noodles right after you order! Woot woot!! The beef is very tender and extremely flavourful. The braised pork #11 soup is very very very delicious!!! But fatty. I will return!!!!This is Chinese food. If Japanese ramen is what you're looking for, go to Kazu!
