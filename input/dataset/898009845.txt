I was new Pilates and was a little nervous as I have scioliosis  with rods. I found the facility very clean and attractive. Alexis, the owner, is an excellent instructor and very knowledgeable  taking extra care to address my limitations. As I became more proficient and confident, I notice significant improvement in my strength and comfort level. With scoliosis, core strength  and agility are severely compromised. Pilates addresses just that as well as overall strengthing. As a RN, I was impressed at Alexis' ability to evaluate and adjust movements  to accomodate  my limitations and focus on my unique issues. I find that I now have waist again and have the strength to hold myself  more upright  giving the appearance of regaining some of my lost height.  I probably have gained at least 1/2- 1 inch much to my delight. I find myself looking forward to my classes  for the  benefits and pleasant conversations.    Thanks, Alexis, for improving my life.       Victoria R.
