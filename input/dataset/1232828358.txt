I recently visited Phoenix and stayed at the Hilton Hotel. After my work meeting went back to my room and decide to order food from this place. I had the Shrimp Fra Diavolo and a side salad. The salad was plain no flavor and lacked dressing. The Shrimp was over cooked and it's tasted like rubber. The linguini tasted rancid, nothing special about the sauce. I literally could not continue on eating the rancid taste the linguini had. Keep in mind this plate cost $27 and only included three shrimps. I could careless for the price, but at least focus on the taste. I will avoid this place at all cost when visiting Phoenix. Just horrible!!!
