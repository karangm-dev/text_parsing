Honestly at first we were hesitant on coming here but we decided to give it a try since we were staying at the MGM hotel anyway. And I am so HAPPY with our decision! Best buffet we've tried in Vegas, hands down. We went to Rio yesterday because everyone was raving about it, not great at all. This tops all! Not only was the food great, service was amazing as well! Super kid friendly! Big restaurant, super clean and food actually looked fresh. Really can go on and on about how great this buffet was. Recommending to everyone!!
