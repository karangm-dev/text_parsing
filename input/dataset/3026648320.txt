Allow me to begin by saying I love Mexican food.  Love. It.  That said, my opinion is based on lots of visits to Mexican restaurants.The service was great.  I was seated quickly, my water and chips/salsa arrived almost immediately, and my food arrived less than 5 minutes after I ordered it.  The salsa was so spicy I couldn't eat it, but the chips were good (and warm!)The food was meh.  It wasn't bad, but it was far from good.  Bland is the best word I can think to use; there really wasn't much flavor to anything.  Additionally, the portions were tiny, easily the smallest amount of food I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant.  I ordered the one enchilada (chicken) and one hard taco (beef) lunch special, which came with fried beans and rice.  The plate was three-fourths covered in beans and rice, leaving just enough room for the tiny enchilada, and the taco placed on top of the rice.  There was hardly any cheese on my taco, enchilada or beans.  The taco was full of lettuce, with a tiny amount of beef.  It absolutely was NOT worth the money I paid for my lunch "special."  Honestly, you'd get more food going to Taco Bell and ordering a taco, and a beef enchirito  Plus it's way cheaper, and would taste better, too.Two stars since it wasn't horrible food, and the service was excellent.  For people who can't handle spicy food, or don't like food with flavor, this is the perfect place for lunch or dinner!
