My Husband and I were staying down the street in an AirBNB and we stumbled across this ice cream shop.  We tried about 5 different flavors during our stay and all of them were delicious! You can tell they take their ice cream seriously.  The quality of the ice cream speaks for itself.  The price was reasonable. So reasonable that I would recommend going a size up because their flavors do change on a daily basis so if you love a flavor it might not be there tomorrow. Which just means you will have to try something new.  The staff was super friendly and helpful.  They took the time to answer our questions and have a friendly chat. The ambiance of the shop is super cute too!
