I've been to a lot of the Mexican places in town and this is by far the best. The service is always friendly and the prices are very reasonable. Their carnitas are probably the best I've had and their house habenero sauce is great. Ask for it when you go if you like the heat. The mole and chicken anything is great as well. Can't go wrong with anyone of the desserts either. This place is a must if you want good Mexican food. It blows away the local competition.
