Been coming here for about 2 years . They always give me great service , and the food here is delicious !!! Lumberjack is the go to food when I come here. It consists of biscuits sausage egg bacon and gravy with a side of fruit or potatoes ! Everyone is friendly here , I love the atmosphere . It's not too crazy . Kid friendly spot.
