I wanted a security system installed as soon as my house closed on 12/15/15 and JPG was able to deliver.  Jim was so knowledgeable and polite!  He had an installation done within 1-2 days and I couldn't be happier  The keypad is easy to use and my 10-year old said he felt safer -- that's what it's all about!  Thank you, Jim!  I highly recommend JPG!
