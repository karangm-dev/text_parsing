They keep there appointments on time and are pretty efficient. However I am very disappointed in how they think that just because I am a girl that I do not know what is going on with my car's tires. The guy that helped me out told me that my two front tires tread was extremely low and that I would be needing two new tires in a month or two. He told me that he could show me the same tires I have on there now and how much they would be. When the I had taken my car to the other Discount Tire they told me it that my tread was actually still really good for how many miles I have on my car. When he told me the price of the two tires it was around $280. Which I had just bought two new ones a couple months before that and they were the same price. So when I bought the two new tires my tire pressure light came on not that long after that. I honestly feel like the tires were not even new and did not look worth $280.
