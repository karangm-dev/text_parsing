Everything was overpriced and mediocre tasting. Make sure you make reservations, otherwise end up waiting hours to get a bay. You are better off going to play mini golf, or going to an actual golf course. Service was below average from the staff. Our server at our bay semi yelled at us to give him all our cards, then must have seen the look on my face and changed his tone.
