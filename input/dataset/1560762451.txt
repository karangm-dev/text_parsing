A wise man once told me "don't judge a restaurant by its strip mall location". Totally true for this place. While the outside isn't super beautiful - the sushi plates are. We came on a Saturday evening and we're seated right away. Service was very good. And most importantly, the sushi was great! We had four rolls. The "regular" rolls were just as delicious as the "specialty" rolls. As we we're leaving I realized they have happy hour all day on Tuesday and Wednesday and 3 until 6 the other days. During happy hour all regular rolls are $3. Since these regular rolls are really good, that's quite a deal. I can't wait to come back and try some more! Who wants to go to happy hour with me?
