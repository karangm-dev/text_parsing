A hidden gem in the desert!  Being a foodie, I enjoy exploring the city in search of little hole in the wall restaurants and ethnic fare.  This place is no exception.  Located in a non-nondescript shopping center in a rougher part of town, Merkato Cafe serves some of the best Ethiopian food in Las Vegas.  Upon entering, don't let the drab interior deter you: the food speaks for itself.  Whenever the mood strikes, my girlfriend and I order our usual: veggie combo with Kitfo (raw steak tartare) to the amusement of our servers.  The meal is traditionally eaten by hand and no utensils but can be provided upon request.  The portions are huge, healthy and best of all, delicious!  We can never finish off the meal and get it packed up.  For the veggie combo, meat entree and a drink, all can be had for a mere $20!  great deal for a great meal!  Highly recommended!
