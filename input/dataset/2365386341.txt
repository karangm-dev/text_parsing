The bibimbap is mind blowing.  I had never heard of it or knew what it was and went solely on Yelp reviews and ordered it.  I ordered and extra sauce to mix in and it made it perfect.  The side dishes were sub par but it didn't matter bc the entree was so good.  What a perfect addition to the park road shopping center!  The environment is really nice so you could go for a date night, girls night, etc.  the service was really good as well!  I wish the prices were a tad bit cheaper.
