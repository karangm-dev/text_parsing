Super unimpressed with this store. Came in excited to find a dress for my brothers wedding to only be seriously disappointed and robbed of way too much money. I found my dress! I tried on the floor sample size 14. It was a smidge too small so they told me they would measure me and order my dress for me. After being measured they told me I would need a size 24. They then told me that I would be charged $40 extra since I'm plus size and that I would need a dress larger than a 20. That should have been my first red flag. I paid them their money and waited patiently for my dress to come in. Alteration day finally came and when I put the dress on it was a potato sack on me. The alterations lady pinned me and  told me what she would do to make the dress fit better. I paid an additional $60 for my dress to be altered. I received a call two weeks later that my dress was ready to go. I went, tried my dress on and nearly burst into tears as it was still way to big! I took my dress and brought it to another alterations place and we brought my size 24 dress back down to an 18. So here I paid an extra $40 for being "bigger" and then another $60 to have it "altered" to only be majorly disappointed. I then spent more money to get the dress where it should be. I will never recommend this place to anyone. They steal your money and leave you unhappy!
