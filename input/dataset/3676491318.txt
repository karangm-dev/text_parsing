I came in much by accident, and I'm very glad I did.  Don't let the strip mall location fool you, this is restaurant quality food.  I had the chicken lunch, and the portion was really good.  The chicken was of good quality, not some cheap tiny pieces held together with tendons.  The veggies were perfect, a little crisp which I love.  The rice had amazing flavor without being heavy or greasy.  The price is right in line with a small strip mall place but the food tastes much better then I expected.  The owners were there and they are so sweet.  I plan on returning as much as I can.  Do yourself a favor and try it!
