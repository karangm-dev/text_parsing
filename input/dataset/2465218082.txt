Best BBQ I've ever had, really! A nice selection of different sandwiches, and GREAT sides! Chili, jalapeno cornbread, sweet potato fries.. I could go on. Give this place a try, you will not be disappointed. Their Italian Beef Sandwich with Hot Peppers is my favorite, but everything is good here. They have great service and they're always friendly and helpful.
