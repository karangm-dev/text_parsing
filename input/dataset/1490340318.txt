Wow! I love this place! I've been searching for good Indian cuisine in Arizona for some time now. I'm originally from NYC and feel like I'm a connoisseur if Indian cuisine. I've finally found it at Taj Mahal. The food is awesome. It is seasoned just right and an explosion of flavors for your palate. I've been eating mostly vegetarian and they had numerous vegetarian and vegan options on the menu. I really look forward to returning and trying more dishes. The added bonuses are the atmosphere and the service. The restaurant has a great and cozy decor that is clean and welcoming. Most importantly was the service. Our server Sandra was awesome! She was super friendly and attentive! The owner, Gil, is a great guy as well! He has super positive energy! He visits ever table to make sure you're satisfied and just has an infectious upbeat happy energy that rubs off! I will definitely be returning soon!
