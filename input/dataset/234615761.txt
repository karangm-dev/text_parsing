I love this car wash!  This is a drive through machine car wash joints that offers packages starting from 6 dollars to 20 I believe.  I got the 6 dollar basic pack and your wash comes with a complimentary towel and air freshener. After the wash, my car was clean except for dirt trapped in scratches and my tires. I don't think they get the tires that well but I was pretty happy that a majority of the dirt and dust was gone. My windows were clean and no spots remained. The part I love the most is the free vacuum stations you can use after the wash. I would come here for that alone!  There's no time limit and you can easily vacuum your entire car.. Which I did.  There are two hoses, one on each side of your car for convenience and the hose reaches back to your trunk.   I love this quick and cheap car wash!  This will definitely be my go to spot in vegas.
