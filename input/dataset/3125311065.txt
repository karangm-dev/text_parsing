Many people tell me they prefer In-N-Out over Fat Burger (or any other burger for that matter). To them I say, to each his own. Me? I prefer big juicy, greasy burgers, not small "clean" burgers. When I'm eating a burger, it's not supposed to be healthy or good for me. That's why a FATBURGER wins in terms of taste, size, and overall satisfaction. With a order of Fat Fries and a Large Coke. Yeah, now that's heaven. You can keep your overated, non-burger tasting in-n-out "burgers". Now, someone needs to bring a franchise to San Francisco.
