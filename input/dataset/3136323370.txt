I would not recommend flowers by Renee. I called to have some flowers delivered to my 7 year old niece who was at home recovering from a very traumatic experience and I was told they would be delivered this afternoon.  It's 4:50pm and I just got off the phone with them and I was told "they are going out next".  I was also told that "if you wanted them there by a certain time I needed to be clear and make arrangements for that." I had explained the whole traumatic experience to the girl who took my order so I thought it was pretty clear that the sooner the better. I guess it's all business to some people. There was no apology, no making up for it.  I picked this florist because they were 1.75 miles from my sister's house and with paying the $10 delivery fee I thought they would get there in the afternoon as I was told. The minimum order is $35 and then you add on the $10 delivery....I would expect some customer service and polite people for that.  I hope the flowers are pretty.  If they're not decent I will be sure to add another review.  I'm giving this a one star with giving them the benefit of the doubt that the flowers will be nice.  I won't use them again either way!
