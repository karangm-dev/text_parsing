Never received our food. Worst ever. Do not waste your time as they wasted mine! Not worth a star.Attempted to place an online order twice it did not go through so I called this location nearest to my home. She tool my order said it would be ready in 10 min. I get there and stand in front. 4 employees see me and turn away. No one acknowledged me. I walk around the bar slowly to find another register on the side for on the go orders. There's a female staff member there. As I walk over she walks away. The bartender doesn't acknowledge me & clearly I'm lost. I wait 3 more minutes it's now 15 minutes after I placed order. An employee sees me! She tells me I need to go to the bar to pick up my order. Great. I sit myself at the bar and wait for the bartender to be told that I'm picking up an order to which she finally walks my way and says oh hi how can I help you. ? Really. She then looks into the magical computer & sees there are no pick up orders. Grand. She asks me to wait (cause apparently it's what customers do best) she walks back to the other girl who tells her she remembered putting the order in but - wow - it's not in her magical computer either! She walked over to tell me this and after a moment of staring at me asks if I "want them to put the order back in?" I asked for the manager (Jimmy) who took 2 more minutes of my time and then came over. Gave a generic apology and I then wasted his time explaining what transpired. Regional manager will get a call. Chilis will get an email & Special Olympic fundraiser will not get their 15%. 15 minutes wasted. Hungry kid. Good night.
