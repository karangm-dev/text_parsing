Yesterday morning a friend and I were craving a breakfast burrito and all the places nearby (downtown Phoenix) weren't open until 9 or 10am.  My friend suggested La Salsita since he's been to other locations and they rocked.  Found out this was the closest to us so we drove over.  The cashier didn't speak a lick of english and I don't speak much spanish so it was a bit interesting trying to order.  I was really surprised that she didn't speak any english (or at least pretended not to).  I was able to order our breakfast burritos and luckily they came out correct.  I know there is a heavy hispanic influence in this area but I'm pretty sure I'm not the only person to ever go in here that doesn't speak spanish.  My chorizo burrito was fine, just had too much chorizo and no other flavors came through.  Would have been better with potatoes in it.  My friend had the steak breakfast burrito and he had one bite and spit it out, the steak was not steak and tasted like rat.  Soooo nasty!  There are so many great little local mexican restaurants nearby that taste better and easier to order.
