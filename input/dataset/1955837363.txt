I ordered a cake batter shake here because it was recommend by a friend. It took them 10 minutes to tell me they were out of cake batter. I asked them for a Carmel frappe instead. It took them several attempts to make and about 30 minutes of my time. They finally just gave up and made a vanilla shake and added a lot of Carmel. Horrible customer service and the biggest waste of time just for ice cream. Very dissatisfied.
