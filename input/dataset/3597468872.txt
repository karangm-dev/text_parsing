If you have no need to stay on THE STRIP, this close to the airport and car rental return hotel is a very good choice. We paid $109 a night for a studio that has a full kitchen and free parking.  Free airport transportation was available. There were a dining table and a office table in the large room.  Free breakfast daily and weekday light dinner were included in the price.  Gym and laundry facility were on site.  There was even a public bus stop in front of the hotel to get you around town. All the employees were extremely friendly and helpful.  No hesitation in staying here again.
