DO NOT STAY HERE! I'd rather sleep in my Car! HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE,   one of my worst hotel experiences. Great location but a dumpster to stay in. poor layout, disgusting rooms, terrible service, I was moved 3 times, rooms were NOISY, DIRTY, STAINS EVERYWHERE,  NO INTERNET, It was a living NIGHTMARE. I actually checked out and went to the Flamingo hotel next door, it was that bad. Never had to leave a hotel before. They also had a 13th floor, and I was checked into Room 665, across from 666, which was very creepy...Don't be fooled by the low prices, it attracts a very low end hillbilly clientele, they were marching through the chaotic lobby with coolers on wheels, and boxes of beer over their shoulders-get the picture?
