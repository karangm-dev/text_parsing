I really really really REALLY like this place......and it's not the all you can drink wine talking =)Well, maybe it's the wine.just.a.little! I had heard about this place for a while now as couple friends had their first dates here. AND it's one of those vintage hole in the wall joints. I am super down with that! Came here on a random night before hitting up The Linq next door. There was a 30 minute wait so we just had a couple drinks at the bar. Prior to coming here, I mentioned to the BF that it was all you can drink wine and he's all "nah, maybe a glass!" Welp, as soon as we sat at our table, we were greeted with a cradle of white AND red wine. YES, TWO ALL YOU CAN DRINK WINES!!!! Our waitress didn't want us to make a choice on which wine to drink. **boom** Our salad was bomb. The pasta we ordered was "eh." I wasn't blown away by the pasta nor did it make an impression. The cappuccino was EXTRA bomb tho! Ambiance was exactly what I pictured. Dimly lit, old school resto. Vintage photos and quotes on the wall. This would be great for first dates :)I'll def be back again. For the wine and cappuccino! And good company, of course :)!
