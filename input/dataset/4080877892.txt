I was in need of somewhat of a hair transformation and today I got just that at Flict. I had a coupon for $50 off a color, cut and style from a local flyer and I decided to look up the reviews and they were great! They are located off of Ray and Dobson next to the Valle Luna restaurant next to the lake. I was greeted right away when I walked in and I loved the vintage decor. Rachel greeted me within a few minutes and took me to her chair. I had lightened my hair to platinum a few days ago with the intent of going to a more honey blonde. Rachel did a very extensive consultation with me to understand exactly what color and style I was going for. When we decided on a color she took me to the bowl to rinse my hair. She was very sweet and we made great conversation, which we all know is a also a very important attribute in a hairstylist. The color probably only took about 30 minutes in total which wasn't too bad at all.When the color was revealed I was beyond happy. It is stunning! A perfect honey golden blonde. She cut my hair in to a shoulder length layered bob and it looks gorgeous and healthy again. She was also training another stylist at the time and is very knowledgeable and really knows her stuff! I would definitely recommend her and  I will definitely be going back. See pics :)0
