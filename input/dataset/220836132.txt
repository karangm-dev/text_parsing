My wife purchased tickets to this through Groupon for our honeymoon in Las Vegas. Their site said that they would email us within 24 hours of booking along with dates to choose from. We followed all the directions as they were stated on their website.Two days had passed with no response whatsoever. When we tried calling them, an automated message said that they do not accept phone calls for booking. What kind of business does not accept phone calls?Thankfully, we were able to receive our money back through Groupon.
