My car was due to be ready at 2. It is now almost 6. I kindly asked ONE time for an eta and was YELLED AT AND CURSED AT in front of a crowded lobby for all to hear. Then the mgr justified it by saying that the detail tech has been under a lot of stress and walked away. SHOCKING. Danny's has lost another loyal customer. Anthony has a MAJOR anger mgmt problem. And his mgr Jordan appears to be totally fine with his his employee treating women (or anyone) that way.  These people are scary thugs.
