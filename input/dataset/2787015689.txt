Returned today to replace a poor meal from the fall. Previously the drive thru screwed up the order. Fried were cold and burgers under cooked with green tomatoes.Our previous concerns were addressed with a replacement whenever we could get back. Today was the day. No idea what we are talking about seems they throw out concerns more than 90 days old.If it happens to you return to the store right away or don't bother complaining . Lesson learned .
