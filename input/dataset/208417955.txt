Stopped by this new location on my annual visit to Toronto because I didn't have time to go in NY before I left. I tried their first location 2 years ago, and I was thrilled the service remains as good  as it was! I love the high quality of service and the product they used. My wax didn't hurt because the type of wax they use doesn't pull the skin. LOVE!!!! I'm hooked! Wish I could bring that back to my NY spot! Overall, I really like this new location, the waxer and definitely the price!! I would definitely recommend!
