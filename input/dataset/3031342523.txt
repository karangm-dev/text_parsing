We went in today to get my so. His first hair cut and the experience was stellar. From the friendly staff, clean floors and wonderful haircut I can not say enough good things. I forgot the ladies name who cut his hair (curly, blonde hair) but she made his first haircut a great experience. She even offered to save his first chopped off hair. She was sweet, friendly and comforting. On top of it, my son has an adorable new hair cut. Thank you!!
