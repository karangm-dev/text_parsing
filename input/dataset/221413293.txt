Try everything! You cannot go wrong here it is fun!It is like a tapas place except it's eclectic, and innovative. They serve everything course by course and you share... I came here with my mom we had a blast. On top of it the staff loves the food too and they are excited to share ideas and get excited about the food as well.The atmosphere is interesting and kind of eclectic almost like a puzzle ... Old books, busy tiles, strange ceramic cookware.... Not pretentious at all but definitely a place that welcomes you and treats you like a king. Whether it's date night, fun with friends or family please go here and give it a try... FUN... How eating should be...
