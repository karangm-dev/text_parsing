New to the Surprise area, used to getting and paying for 4 full pedicures for my family. We went into the shop and were told there is a 10% off services if we did Mani and Pedi's together. My dad had the best person there. My mom had the owner's wife and she did a horrible job, didn't clip toe nails short enough, argued with my mom on why she could not shorten them. Polish was messy and left on the toe skin around the nail, heels were left ragged and looked like she had never been to get her feet done. My son is 13, they left his toe nails ingrown and too long. Scrubbed so hard with the loofah he had blisters on his feet. When it was my turn, I went for ingrown toe nails and left with them still hurting. The guy sort of trimmed my toe nails. When I asked for shorter, he told me they were fine? Skin around my toes were left with clip marks, polish was left on my skin, no clean up with a brush in polish remover. At the end of the pedicures, the owner did not show me the totals where she had removed the 10% discount, gave a number out of the air. Good business starts with being honest with your clients! Shop is dirty, smells like mildew and rotten food. Doors are dirty, floors slippery, dust and cobwebs hanging from ceiling. Health Department needs to visit this shop. It's disgusting!!! Don't go here, they are sloppy and only want the $$.
