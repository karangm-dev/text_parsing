I really wanted to like this place. Sadly I've got to admit I was disappointed . Yes , the sweet potato fries rocked but the place isn't called Barefries . It's called Bareburger and the burger was dry and tasteless ! I asked for medium and clearly indicated that I wanted some pink colour in the middle. Instead I got the greyest , grimmest ,under seasoned ,unyielding piece of flesh I've eaten in a long time. The waitress didn't come around to ask if I was enjoying it  and when she cleared the table  she didn't seem to notice ( or care) that I'd left half of my meal on my plate.  I won't be coming back . My neighborhood greasy spoon does a better job at a fraction of the price!
