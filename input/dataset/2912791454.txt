Yes, the menu is consistent across the Olive Gardens, but we've been coming here for past 2 years for the service--all our birthdays and other celebrations! Don't need to reserve the private room, the staff here will always make the accommodations we need. There are restaurants closer to home but we know we can get treated well here by Gary and his team.
