I wish I could give negative stars to this business. They advertise,"all the washes you would like," for their fastpass plan, but this is not the case. I had a wash in early afternoon, got sprayed with fluids from a car that exploded in front of me and returned to the wash to be denied another wash. One wash per day is what the girl wash employee told me. Do you want to do business with someone that clearly falsely advertises?
