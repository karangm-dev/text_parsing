Scammers!  They advertise these low rates and when you actually get there to get your car, UP Goes the PRICE!  I did need to upgrade my car but I didn't expect a $200 difference!  So I did what I had to do, got a Hyundai Sonata for $307.00. Once I got down to pick up the car I realized and totally overpaid so I went back upstair to see about getting my money back.  Once I got up there, the price went down ton $187 for the same CAR!  So Now I thought, ok I'll pay the extra $50 for my pride and just eat it.  Got the car, had a Great Trip to Cali, went to return the car and they were going to charge me $51 to fill up!  When I had rented it initially they had told me I could prepay for gas at $2.87 which is way cheaper than the real world so I had ok'd it.  When my price magically lowered the second time, it was because they had removed that pre-pay gas. Ugh!  I hate the men at that desk and I will never EVER go back.
