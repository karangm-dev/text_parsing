I ordered a Serta office chair at the store, was told the chair would be delivered in 1 to 3 business days.  I am now on day seven, and no one can tell me where the chair is or when it will be delivered.  In this day and  age of instant access to incredible amounts of information a company that is in the business of selling information related items, affiliates themselves with an organization that cant track their item, does not deserve your business.   Go somewhere else, for your office needs, or make sure you leave the store with your items.
