I've shopped off and on at Penney's my whole life. This store is the best. Excellent customer service from the manager all the way to the cashiers. I recently encountered a frustrating situation with an online order, I called the national customer service number and it was a 13 minute wait. I called this Ahwatukee store and the assistant manager took over and had the issue fixed immediately with extremely satisfying results. They have my loyalty.
