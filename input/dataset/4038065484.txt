I love Dr. Richardson!!! He was my SO Doctor as a child and now he's our sons Doctor. He has so much patience and listens to my concerns. As a new mom I have a lot!!! Very knowledgable and my baby adores him!!! I highly recommend Dr. Richardson to any parent, ESP new moms!! As a new mother I fully trust him and his judgement :)! Thank you for being so patient and the absolute best!!!! If I can rate him a billion stars I would :)!
