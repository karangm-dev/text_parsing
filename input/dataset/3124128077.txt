This is one of the first restaurants that meets Mr B's high expectations for breakfast, but specifically pancakes!   Usually I hear a litany of complaints about restaurant pancakes, but yesterday all I heard was compliments.   What a relief!   It's hard to find buckwheat pancakes at many restaurants, so we were excited when we saw it on the menu.   Probably the best buckwheats ever.   Hash browns were perfect, another item that frequently leads to disappointment.   I got the junior Dutch baby, which was so delicious. We plan on eating here one,  two,  maybe 3 more times during our stay in Scottsdale.   It's that good.   It's really busy, so that would be the only thing keeping us away.
