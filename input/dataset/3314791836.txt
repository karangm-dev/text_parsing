Amazing customer service and product.  It is funny, the tendency is to get clothing somewhere where you feel like you are getting a deal.  A department store.  But those clothes are just not great.  You don't get good service, you get a sales rep.  My fiancee and I walked into Jabbour's to rent a suit for my upcoming wedding.  So maybe George upsold me to buying a suit, BUT I LOVE THE SUIT.  It looks awesome, fits me perfectly, was very reasonably priced.  Everything about the experience was great and I would recommend the place to anybody looking for formal attire.  Go here first, and if it is out of your price range (it probably won't be) then go shop at a mall.
