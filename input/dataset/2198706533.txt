Visited for Sunday Brunch.Nice location,easy parking.Greeted fairly quickly after hostess turned around at the hostess stand.When asked outside or in ?we chose inside and where seated promptly just inside the doorway.Server was very pleasant and food served in timely fashion.My dish was barely luke warm and potatoes cold.When finally able to get servers attention she apologized and brought my plate back in kitchen to be reheated in microwave which I could see from my vantage point : ( My dish contained shrimp which doesen't improve in micro but thats not the servers fault.Overall the staff is very friendly but more so to each other while catching up on the night before activities.I have not been wowed by this place yet but not sure if I ever will?Didn't recieve visit by manager at all during visit only acknowledged on leaving.This was my 3rd or 4th visit
