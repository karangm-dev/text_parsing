The service was fast and the food was good. But when I ordered one of the women behind the counter argued with me about the menu. I kept saying ok to her over and over and she kept repeating that the menu item that read 'blazing chicken and waffle' was a sandwich. Ok, I still want that. And this went on for a few minutes and I finally just stopped talking. I still don't understand what the problem was. I just wanted to make sure they gave us the spicy chicken not plain. The drinks are what are going to get you here. Coffee is 1.79 and sodas are 2.29 and you get a 16.9 oz bottle and a cup of ice, no refills obviously. It's worth mentioning, there's something wrong with the ventilation system. After about 15 min everyone's eyes started watering and you could see the cloudiness towards the kitchen. They seem to be nice people and the food is reasonable priced, two adults and two kids (not ordering the kids menu) was $47 with the tip. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but I wouldn't argue if someone else wanted to come here.
