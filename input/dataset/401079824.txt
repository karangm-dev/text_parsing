Had our first experience with Casanova's on Sunday night and I was beyond impressed. I lived in NYC for 6 years and have turned in to some what of a pizza snob, always on the hunt for a pizza spot similar to ones in NYC. I finally found it! From their menu and toppings, to the experience at pick-up and then the actual pie itself, everything was excellent and of superior quality.When I picked up the pie the woman behind the counter asked me if I was a new customer, she then shouted to the kitchen, using my name, that I was new and everyone cheered saying "hi/welcome Tiffany". She then offered me an order of free garlic knots to try as a first time customer. It definitely set the tone for what then was the best pizza I have found in Arizona, and quite frankly outside of NYC.This is a must try and is now the only pizza place I will be ordering from.
