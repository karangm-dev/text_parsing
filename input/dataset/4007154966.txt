Sad to say, but this place has fallen off greatly. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. We use to eat here all the time when we lived here 10 yrs ago. The food was bad.  I had pad see ew which was so awful (bland mixed with nasty) I didn't eat more than one forkful. I put it to the edge of the table. When the teenage waitress (they're letting the kids run the place, you know) saw this discarded food, she asked if I wanted a box. When I said no and that I didn't like this dish, she just said "ok" and moved on. My wife's sesame tofu was slightly better, but nowhere near what it use to be.R.I.P. Thai Gourmet, we barely knew ye.
