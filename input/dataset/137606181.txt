I have been getting lash extensions for 3years now. I had a great person in San Diego and when I moved to Vegas it was a real struggle to find someone who did lashes well. I had gone to a few places and just never felt happy with my lashes until I met Linda She is honestly the best in the Valley and you can't beat her prices. She always starts by  cleaning up your lashes before she starts putting lashes on which I find is rare.. Most people don't take that time to clean your lashes, they just stack new lashes on old ones which eventually becomes a mess and damages your lashes. Linda is really just INCREDIBLE. You won't find anyone more precise and as thorough as her and you can't beat her prices.. Not to mention after/before lashes you could get a massage! Amazing Lashes and maybe a massage.. You can't get any better!
