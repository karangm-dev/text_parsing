The service Felecia provided was phenomenal. She took her time to explain the menu and was prompt with our drinks and food order. Now on to the food....YUM!!! We shared the biscuits and gravy and a side of Mac and cheese. The biscuits are on the top five of our favorite! It was light, but flavorful. To top it off they give a chicken thigh that was amazing. The Mac and Cheese was to die for. Creamy, cheesy and a bit of a crunch. If you like good southern cooking and a laid back atmosphere definitely check this place out!!
