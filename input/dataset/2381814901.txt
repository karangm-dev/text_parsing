OMG Fat Tuesdays is so good I went here every day for my 4 day trip in Vegas last week and it was awesome I mean when I said I came here every day I mean I came here every day and try different drinks. I have so many souvenir cups I couldn't even take them all home.  if you're going to be in Las Vegas  you need to hit up Fat Tuesdays. They have several different locations. I stayed at the Harrah's Hotel and Casino so this place is right outside of the hotel. My favorite part about this place is you can get extra shots added into your Blended cocktail my favorite was the mango rum with an added Malibu rum shot. Hits the spot just right on those hot days or nights!
