Deserve 0 stars. Need new remote and asked about that. Was told remote was $35-$45 and programming would be $25. Took me asking 3 times to even get that info. Was told tech could tell me when arrived but I wanted to know before hand. Made an appt for between 11am-2pm for remotes and programming. 2 o'clock rolls around and nobody shows. I called at 2:03 inquire about lateness. Tech was on his way, approx 15 mins out. I asked about a free remote or programming since late. Was told no they don't do work for free. I asked why they set appts they aren't keeping then. And asked to cancel then. Tech sounded angry and asked so you don't want us to come out because we won't work for free? I started to say no but a discount should be offered because you can't keep your appts and was hung up. Called back to speak with a manager. Was busy so gave my name and number. We'll see if they bother calling back.
