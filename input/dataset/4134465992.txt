I went here earlier this month to get my dress steamed for a wedding and the lack of customer service at this place is beyond me. My mom and I dropped off my dress at 3:30pm and the woman working there said to come back in an hour, so my mom and I went to the food court and walked around to kill time. We went back at 4:30 and a different woman was there, she handed me someone else's dry cleaning without even reading the name on the receipt! So I gave it back to her and behind the glass of their working station, I saw my dress on a table and it still hadn't been steamed! It was unbelievable. I couldn't believe that they had told us to come back in an hour yet they couldn't even steam a dress that would've taken less than 10 minutes if done well! So once my mom had noticed she said something right away. The ladies in the back grabbed my dress and rushed to steam it quickly right before my eyes. She was doing a rushed job, and handed me my dress back with wrinkles and she blamed the material of my dress. My mom got very upset and made them steam it again and the woman there did it and rolled her eyes. You had one whole hour to get the job done! Don't be mad at us for making you do it again because you didn't get things done! I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, even if this happens to be convenient at the time. Go to another place!
