This location is the most beautiful of all the Wildflower Bread in Phoenix.  It has gorgeous glass flowers hanging from the ceiling.The food is as beautiful as the decor.  The bread is always fresh and delicious, great selection.  The menu choices are varied.  My favorite is the Chopped Salad.  Each ingredient is presented in rows with the yummy dressing on the side.  A perfectly balanced salad that is not your usual lettuce and toppings.This place is always crowded for lunch, even the outdoor patio is filled to capacity.I have recommended Wildflower to many people, none have been disappointed.
