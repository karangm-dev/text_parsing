They deceive you & lie to you to make the "sale." Mike stated that one of my certificates expired and in order for me to make it active again I needed to put a deposit of $200. What he didn't tell me was that he was really trying to make a sale. I've been conned twice from them. Last year and just recently. Don't do it or you'll make the biggest mistake of your life. My mistakes is your gain and I hope you take my advice. I'm fighting the battle to get my money back.
