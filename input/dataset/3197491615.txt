My first accident ever and I got rear ended on the 215, of course. I went through Allstate, the other guy's insurance. I gave them a call and with Allstate you have to take your car to one of their drive-ins for an insurance agent to go over the damage. I'm a busy working mom and definitely didn't want to take my car to two different places. Allstate recommended New Look Collision Center which has two locations and a third smaller one that they use as mainly the Allstate drive-in thing. Even though my car was going to one of their other locations New Look let me drop my car off at the drive-in and they handled getting it to go where it needed to be for me! They even have Enterprise people there to help with rentals.Lew handled taking care of my repairs and one of the girls in the front office would call me with updates. Pretty sure I heard from the shop more often than the Allstate agent.. I was told by Lew that it could take up to five days for the repairs to be finished but on day three I was called to pick it up! I was happily surprised to see that the outside AND inside of my car had been detailed! I wasn't expecting such service when I drive a 2011 Ford Escape. Lew walked around the car with me and my rear bumper looked brand new!Sticking to a timeline and keeping in contact are very important to me. Received great service and couldn't be happier. Would definitely recommend to other people!
