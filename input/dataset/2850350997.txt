I have been here twice now and had the same thing both times. First of all, the decor is really awesome and although it's a pretty big building, it's not crowded and they don't put in unnecessary tables. I had the buttermilk pancakes with caramelized bananas and it was amazing. Before your meal they bring out a focaccia bread with a pesto dip. The service has been very attentive both times and I would love for them to expand and open more locations.
