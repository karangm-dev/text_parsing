Horrible customer service at dispatch. My car was damaged during towing. Car was towed to dealer. they called me right away telling me all my warning lights were on. I own a BMW i3 it's an electric car, I only needed  a tire! It was towed wrong, should have been put on a flat bed and not pulled. Just got the car I didn't know, but I would think that a towing COMPANY would know that. Called Phenomenal to let them know. Lady told me I was wrong, the tow driver didn't drive my car so he couldn't have damaged it. Really! And he has been there for ten years! Never listened to what I was trying to tell her. I'm sure it was an accident. But she could have just listened so that it didn't happen again! I put a claim with my roadside assistance company the send them out they reimbursed me the cost of resetting all the sensors.
