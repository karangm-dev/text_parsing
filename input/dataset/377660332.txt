The chicken is excellent, but the coleslaw is horrid, and the fries even worst.  They have to know how terrible the slaw and fries are...just sayin'. We get only the chicken and go to Popeye's, or KFC for fries and slaw.  I wish the owner cared enough to step up to the plate and get better slaw and fries!
