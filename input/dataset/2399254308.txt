I was struggling on the rating of this casino because everyone in the group won some money, but the customer service we received from the servers was pretty bad. You can No longer get drunk while gambling since the server come and check up on you every 30 minutes and they only bring you 1 drink at a time. We wanted to continue gambling but wanted to drink as well so we opted out to go to a bar instead. Every time you ordered a drink the server asked, are you playing and are you going to continue to play. Even when we tipped they were still rude. And every server feels so entitled to tips, even with their shitty attitude!
