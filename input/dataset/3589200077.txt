Where do I start, how about with desert?!  You can not go to Green and not get a tsoynami!  They offer many different flavors so why not just try them all, you won't be let down.  From fruit to chocolate and peanut butter, just pick one!  The fact that you can go to a restaurant and not ask your server if what you order is vegetarian friendly is a dream come true!  I go to Green when I am craving vegetarian comfort food.  The spicy buffalo wings and vegan chili fries are a good way to kick that craving.   The no harm chicken parm sandwich is so tasty but watch out it is messy!  If you want something a little healthier I recommend one of the bowls or a salad of course.  Either way in my opinion you won't go wrong with whatever you try.  Vegetarian food has come a long way and I couldn't be happier to have so many options!!!
