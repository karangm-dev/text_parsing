Worst food ever!! We went here last night and I never had such horrible Italian food and so over priced!  The sauce is so sweet and the portions very skimpy. My daughter got the Mac and cheese and it looked like dry noodles in a bowel. We asked for more sauce and they brought us sauce that tasted like sweeter condensed milk with cream. The bread was dry and stale. They only bring you four pieces and exactly for small pats of butter.The service was terrible! Our waitress was running the bar and the tables all around us. Every time we asked for something it took 15-30mins to receive it. The hostess brought us more things then our waitress. I see this place going out of business real soon!! Just awful!!
