This Chipotle's food is like any other Chipotle in the country, in my opinion, which I would give 3 or 4 stars for taste and quality. However, I came here a couple weeks ago on a Sunday afternoon to pick up takeout before going to a friend's house... and it took me over 30 minutes to get my food. This location is NOT "fast food" if waiting in a 40-50 person line is the norm! One of the employees did apologize, stating that they were short several employees. However, I hate to say it, but the employees did not really seem to be hustling, even though the line wrapped around the entire restaurant. Between the miserable parking situation and very long wait, I won't be returning here again.
