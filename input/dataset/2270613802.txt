SCAM!! beware, its a total bait and switch.  The coupons online are only to get them in your house were they immediately upsell 6x the price advertised.  I fell for the $49 for a sofa and loveseat - I explained on the phone there was cat urine on both items and needed them cleaned.  She said I could use the coupon but there "may": be an extra charge if needed. When the tech arrived he said immediately that with cat urine,  because it is so strong, would require a lot of extra work and the cost would be $299!!!  If that was the case the person making the appointment would have known there would have been an upcharge, but she said nothing all, even said I could use the coupon.    The service tech said there would be a cancellation charge of $20 for not using the inflated service!!  This fee is not advertised on their web page.  How can I be charged for cancelling something prior to a final quote.  $299 is enough to clean my entire house.  I am not the one!!  I have called the company, my credit card company and will make sure everyone knows to avoid this company.  Beware, from what I can see they have several pages, with different numbers and the website has yet another!!  I would love to see slimy companies like this go out of business.  Make an honest living!!
