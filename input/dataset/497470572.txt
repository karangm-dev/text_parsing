I think it's new owners. Not the same....I asked the woman behind the counter if they were new owners and received a hesitant reply of "same chef" and no confirmation of ownership change. All the sample cakes that adorned the store's wall pedestals were gone as well as the framed articles on the wall of the celeb cakes featured in many magazines. Macarons did not taste the same, less variety and now selling all sorts of Majestic Bread productsWouldn't be surprised if name change was forthcoming
