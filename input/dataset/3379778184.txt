VERY DISAPPOINTED -Signed contract to redo interior pool. Had to call CDC Pools to remind their Superintendent to call me. Chip out was supposed to occur on Friday. No show so called CDC Pools. I was told chip out crew would be there "first thing" Saturday morning. Tile employee called to say he would be there on Monday to install tile. CDC Pools called on Friday advising of 2nd payment needed at time of chip out. Chip out crew no showed again on Saturday. Superintendent was called on Saturday and had no idea why chip out crew did not show up (POOR COMMUNICATION INTERNALLY) but confirmed they were supposed to be there Saturday morning according to employee who scheduled them. Tile employee re-contacted me on Sunday night to let me know he was showing up Monday morning to install tile. He was never told by anyone at CDC Pools, Superintendent included, that chip out crew never showed up so he could not install tile. I had to notify the tile employee Monday morning not show up. No apologies were ever given and demanded deposit be refunded. Poor business practices and poor communication, internally and externally. CDC Pools website says they "Deliver perfection on every project" and "Believes your pool remodeling project is important and will act like it". Both statements are "LIES" in my opinion. I was excited to have my pool redone but that excitement is gone and I will feel apprehensive on my next company I use. THANKS CDC POOLS!!!!!!!
