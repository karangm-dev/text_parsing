Had to ask the person going to make my sanwich to change her gloves after handling money and making a bunch of coffees. Just seems common sence that the gloves should only be touching food, ur wearing them for a reason. Also no outlets to charge my laptop so here i am upset writing a review on my phone.Food is the same as every other location and at least the coffee wasnt burnt or whatever that random awful cup is caused by.
