This rating is not just about arrowhead lexus but also about lexus in general.  This is my third Lexus and each subsequent ownership experience has been worse than before.  Do not get the wrong, the cars R great and wonderful but it is the service department that  is crooked and dishonest even on the best day.  Unfortunately the car needs to be taken in every 5000 miles because the display is covered by a large warning sign.  Initial oil change was $80 and then I certainly got a shock when the 35,000 mile service was $900.  I grudgingly paid for it even though I felt I was getting cheated with a lot of things that the car really did not need.  Next time I went for the oil change discharged $660.  The oil change itself is $130.  The filters are another $200.  I was so angry at this that I walked out of the dealership and went to sun Devil and had the same service for $75.  I have now sworn that I will never ever own a Lexus ever again.  They are nothing but a bunch of crooks in every Lexus dealership that I have dealt with, whether it is a Lexus ( now the Scottsdale Lexus) or arrowhead Lexus now.
