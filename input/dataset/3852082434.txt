This has to be the slowest Jack in the Box ever.  There was one customer ahead of me, already sitting at a table.  The cashier was very nice - gave me time to decide before I ordered.  So I got my cup for my soda, filled up and waited.. and waited.. Finally after 10 minutes the one customer ahead of me got their order.   My order was to go, so I'm standing there watching the back.  I finally got mine 10 minutes later - but I saw that my burger was done and sat at the fries bin when they decided to put fries into the fryer.  Then the fries were done, dumped out, and they too sat there while the cashier took orders for new customers.  Apparently the man who puts the fries into the fryer cannot scoop them into the sleeve.   So, when I finally got my food, it was 20 minutes after I ordered - burger was cold and fries were luke warm.  Guess I won't be going here again.  If they were busy, I would understand.  But everyone was standing around gossiping.
