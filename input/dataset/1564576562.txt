Went in on a Saturday morning at 10:50 AM.  The girl in the front said she was going to clean a table and seat us. This was said in front of her co-worker, who reassured us that our table would be ready in a few minutes.  About a minute later he decides to try and seat us at the bar, even though our table is ready. We explain that we would rather sit at the table instead. Our waitress was pleasant and took our order at 10:55 AM.  Drinks were brought out quickly, but there was no silverware or napkins on the table. At 11:15 AM our waitress comes to the table to inform us that the computer "lost" our order and she needed to write it down again. She was very apologetic. At 11:25 AM she came back again and said the food would be out shortly, there were a few orders ahead of ours. At 11:30 AM I called the Manager over to explain that we had been now waiting 35 minutes for 2 omelettes and still had not received the food and at this point was ready to pay for our beverages and leave. He apologized and said the food would be right out. Fast forward another 5 minutes and we were finally served, but had to point out that we still had no silverware. Again, the waitress was very apologetic and took the beverages (1 orange juice and 1 lemonade) off of the bill. The food was good (what you expect from Denny's),  but was not worth waiting 40 minutes for.
