This is a gem of a coffee shop. It has that hard to find mix of excellent coffee paired with a comfortable space where you can either linger with friends or work on your laptop. The owner is a kind but no-nonsense guy who makes sure you like what he's served you before he gets you to pay.The coffee itself is Australian-style, so you can get your long black, short black, flat white, and so on here. The owner-barista knows what he's doing here, so the drinks are done well.What really puts this place over the top is the space itself. As you enter, it is immediately welcoming, especially because of the sign welcoming all races, genders, and identities. Inside, it feels like the library in your uncle's cozy country residence (if he had such a thing), but transported into downtown Toronto. There are newspapers and books strewn about the mix of tables, photos and paintings adorning the walls, and even a wall of diplomas from a variety of global universities. Most of the tables have outlets nearby, and the owner has placed handy adapter cables around the place so you can charge your phone. Also, as a side note, the ingeniously designed toilet/bathroom sink is worth a look.This is a place definitely worth seeking out if you want a break from all the coffee chains that populate Toronto's downtown core.
