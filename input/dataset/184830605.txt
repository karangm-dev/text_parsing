This place does not have management? ! They were busy as hell,and slow,slow,slow,slow that was just killing me,I love the bread it is really good but  personal it slow .I give 5 start for the bakery  and 0000000 start for the SLOW SLOW Employees, and instead of helping to ring up the costumers they were doing other stuff and OWNER PUT ATTENTION TO YOUR BUSINESS!
