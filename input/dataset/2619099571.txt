Soooo glad my husband and I came across this place the other day. Was driving around looking for some place to eat while waiting for the mall to open and happened to see the sign from the street. Definitely a throw back restaurant filled with history and comfort. The food was great (I had the short stack and Denver omelet and my husband had the apple pie). Our waitress was awesome and checked on us constantly. My husband asked about a pie that we had when we went to a diner in South Dakota - strawberry rhubarb- and the owner said he would check if his wife can make it and call us when she has it perfected! How's that for service?!?! If you want the small town dining experience- this is definitely the spot!
