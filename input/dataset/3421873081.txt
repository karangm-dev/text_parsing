I have been to Vegas quite a few times and never stopped in here.  This place is a must see.  It is super cheap, $2 for adults and $1 for kids.  It features a lot of history of Vegas and the surrounding areas and also has a lot of old homes from different periods that you can walk through that have all of the furniture, etc from that period.  I would definitely suggest starting any Vegas trip here to learn the history and then set out and do the other touristy things you have planned.
