Working in the hospitality industry I was amazed by the food and service provided to me and my friends for lunch. We had the Nacho's, the Burger w/Mac and Cheese and Pulled Pork sandwich w/BBQ Sauce, unbelievable!!! A Bloody Mary that was over the top with bacon, veggies and a pepperoni stick!! Great service by Amanda and got to meet Jason the GM who provided a positive dining experience! We will definitely be back!
