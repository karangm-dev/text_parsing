Two-ski for Touski. Good grilled cheese with goat cheese and sundried tomatoes. Nice outdoor seating area. I waited 45 minutes to get 1 grilled cheese sandwich. You'd expect them to be at least slightly apologetic about that, but they were not. I probably would not come back unless I planned to get something pre-made.
