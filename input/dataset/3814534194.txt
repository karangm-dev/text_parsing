Visually, this place seems like it'd be a good date night restaurant.  It's a little cheesy on the outside with a poorly thought out paint job and a sign in dire need of a graphic designer, but inside it is very romantic with large paintings and an opulent feel to it.  Unfortunately, that's the only really impressive part of the dining experience here.If I had to sum up eating here in one word, that word would be overpriced.  There were bottles of wine on the menu for over $50 you can find at other restaurants in the low 30s (and buy for yourself for less than 20).  The food wasn't bad, but it was very unimpressive.  The gnocchi with gorgonzola I could have made better at home.  It was nothing more than gnocchi covered with alfredo sauce with a little gorgonzola mixed in and plopped on a plate.  No herbs, no spices, not even a garnish.  And for this we paid fine dining prices with a final bill for two people of over $80.The service was friendly and unobtrusive, but nothing especially noteworthy.  It was also very quiet, but that's probably due to the fact that only one other person was there that night and he was dining alone.If you're really hankering for spending 30x the store price for a chef boyardee meal, this is the place for you.  Otherwise, I'd look elsewhere.
