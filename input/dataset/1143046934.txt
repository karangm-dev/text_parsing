Overrated! ProsIt has seafoodConsTiny lobsterLots of fried and mediocre optionsThe infamous seafood buffet that I had heard so much about. All you can lobster, you can't go wrong, right? Well, take your fantasy of all you can eat lobster, shrink the lobster down to jumbo shrimp size and smother it with nondescript sauce, throw in a bunch of other subpar options, and you have the Rio Seafood Buffet.It took me 5 minutes to find the lobster because nothing is labeled, so you don't really know what you're eating. I did a double take as someone showed me the lobster. It was fine, despite its size. I was just hoping for nicely cooked lobster that I could dip in butter. Silly me. The other dishes were okay, but nothing that sticks to my memory. I had two plates, then I was done. $48 down the drain in 20 minutes. Boo.
