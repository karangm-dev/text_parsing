After driving around for awhile to find a place to eat without a wait, I ended up at pei Wei with James C.  I discovered that they revamped the menu entirely. Now you pick a protein and a sauce. No more combos :(I decided to have chicken with spicy Korean sauce and brown rice. We also shared an order of lettuce wraps. Lettuce wraps were as expected. My dish came out and it didn't look like what I expected, but I was hopeful and waited until James got his to dig in. I took a bite of the chicken and whatever flavoring was nonexistent. It was not spicy and really had no taste. I added some soy sauce to the brown rice and for brown rice, it didn't taste good either. I ended up taking just a few bites and leaving the rest. I will reluctantly give them a second chance since I did try something new, but I really wouldn't recommend what I got to anyone.
