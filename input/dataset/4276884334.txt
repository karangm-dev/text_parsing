What can I say about a place with sub par food... I can say its a very happening place. Lots of people and of course by the name you would know it's a candy store and a restaurant. Drinks have that sugary theme you expect from a overprice las Vegas strip spot. I had a root beer float cocktail. Which was not bad, even had floating coco cola candy in it.Dinner: i had the steak and fries. For a place located in the Paris casino, I expected better.... I got sub par ... Steak was ok and fries sucked...... For 23 dollars.. I expect a little more...The girlfriend had the steak arugula salad... Steak was dry ,,.. Salad not memorable. ... Also  started with burger slider... Which was ok for a slider dish,,, presentation suck.... But ok in taste.... On saving grace. We had a great server named, Shane. Very attentive....I wouldn't recommend this resturant. Unless you want fusion sugary theme drinks or funky ice cream dishes.... It's Vegas after all... You got ton of other places to eat at.
