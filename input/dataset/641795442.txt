Very happy that Livewire hosted Duke Dumont and Gorgon City recently (two separate events). I had a great experience both nights! I really like that the venue has a second story, so you can take a break from the giant dancing crowd by sneaking upstairs. By positioning the "VIP" tables and booths upstairs, the dance floor below is even larger. As expected, it is super loud during the shows. Bring earplugs if you're worried/bothered. Duke was on a Saturday and the venue was completely packed. I showed up right before he went on and everyone went crazy when it started. Awesome sound, lights and graphics. I was upset that he played such a short set - only an hour, maybe a little longer. He's only in town once a year so daaaaang, give us more (please)!!!I showed up early for Gorgon City because I wasn't sure when they'd go on since it was a Wednesday night. The two opening artists were excellent and it was fun to watch the dance floor fill up over the course of two dj sets and two hours. By the time Gorgon came on, the venue was full and we were ready to boogie. Because it was a Wednesday, the crowd was excellent - we were all there for the music and all on the same page. Quite different from any crowd you'll find at a club on a weekend. Gorgon played for so long and just killed it with two live singers and a drummer. By far the best live show I've seen in years! Fantastic atmosphere and vibes all around. I'm excited to see what artists Livewire will host next. Keep bringing the deep haus to Old Town, I need it, thank you!!!! (Also, some of us "haus heads" work early in the morning so please schedule the weekday shows earlier than midnight! ;) Thx!)
