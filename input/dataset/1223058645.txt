Pro: Sugary Krispy Kreme, friendly staff. Con: Not fresh enough. Came here after the first day of CES for sugary goodness before dinner time, was a bit disappointed by the fact that this location was only a drop off location, but the service was fast especially have we would tired as hell. Would come back again if around this side of the strip, but still, not beats fresh Krispy Kreme.
