I stayed at the Bellagio for my brother's wedding/the Rock n Roll Vegas Half Marathon, so I got free vouchers for the buffet. After the race and the next morning, I treated myself to the buffet.Dinner buffet: Really disappointing. I had just run 13.1 miles, so I was ready to inhale every bite of food. But as I walked around, everything just seemed...blah. I forced myself to eat different pastas, pizzas, and meats, and it was all just very basic. The one shining part was the tomato soup - I had several bowls of this, and I wish I had more right now.Breakfast buffet: Much better than the dinner one, but still not the best. I loved all of the different potato varieties, and the bar service was very nice and fast with my coffee order. I've heard so many amazing things about Vegas buffets, and especially the Bellagio one, but it just seemed very generic to me. I would have been upset if I didn't have the free vouchers from staying at the hotel.
