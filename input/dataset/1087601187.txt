Mezzo is awesome - local cheeses, charcuterie, pizza, and wine. The pistachio and porchetta pizza is AMAZING, I've never had anything like it. We went for a group dinner during a Steelers home game, so it was pretty quiet, but still with a good atmosphere. Wine selection is stellar, our server Andi was knowledgable and friendly and great!
