I had been to Woodlands once before tonight but it was years ago so I didn't remember much about it. Tonight was with one of my dinner groups and we were all basically in the same boat, we didn't know what to order.  So we started ordering a little of everything in the appetizers and every single one of them had their own unique flavor. We continued on with the entrees.  One of our group had recommendations from coworkers on what to order so most of us went with those.  All of the flavors were wonderful from the vegetable curries to the chickpea and potato entries to the the noodle dinners.  And the bread..wow.  The breads alone would make a meal.  Such unique flavors in the breads.  And the breads were HUUUUUUUGGGGGEEEEEE!   Ok, some of it was puffed air.  But still.  Who would have thunk that 6 meat eaters (and a vegetarian) would enjoy this restaurant so much.   Thank you Woodlands for enlightening me on the flavors of India!
