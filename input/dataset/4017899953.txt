SLOW service, food was cold and WAY overpriced ($9 for a scoop of guac and $6 for a miniature bowl of salsa?!?!?).  Sad that they consider themselves an authentic Mexican resto... I've had way better!  Decor was alright, but the space was very constricting.  If you can skip this restaurant all together, I would suggest you do,
