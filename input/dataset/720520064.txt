I cant give this clinic and Dr. Holt enough praise! this is the only place I bring my precious babies to.  The staff is attentive, understanding and loving! I know my babies are in perfect hands every time they arrive at Animal Kindness.  Dr. Holt without a doubt is the best Vet in Las Vegas.  He is loving, kind and gentle and provides the best care for my babies.  He's been taking care of my babies for more than 10+ years and will continue...you wont be disappointed!
