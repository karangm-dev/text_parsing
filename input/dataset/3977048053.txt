Came back tonight cos, well I'm stupid.Ordered take out. As I was waiting, the sushi chef prepared another customer's order and not once, but twice, ate some of the fish out of his fingers and then proceeded to continue preparing the sushi without washing his hands.Spicy salmon maki with a side of saliva. Gross. Definitely not coming back now.
