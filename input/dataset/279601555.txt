The falafel here was a Big Fat Greek disappointment.  They were dry and flavorless and the pita lacked any real frills.We were here with a large group which they accommodated quite well and our split checks did have a 18% auto grad on them. The menu has many meat free options, but I felt it was my duty to review every falafel in town, and at $7 with salad or fries it was one of the better values on the menu. My plate came with three large falafel patties inside a peta (its not pita here) with a side of taziki and a small "Greek" salad on the side. While the falafel was large, it was hard to eat with out breaking it up, and it was terribly dry and devoid of much flavor.In summary go somewhere else unless you have a large group and need consistent mediocrity of a big chain.
