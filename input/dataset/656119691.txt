WOWZA! Such an amazingly great surprise to find this place. We were walking around the Sunday Farmers market on the canal and tried this place when we got hungry. There is this great Happy Hour all day Sunday you have to try. We enjoyed the tacos, fingerling potatoes, pork wings with spicy slaw, procuitto brusetta. EVERYTHING was so tasty.
