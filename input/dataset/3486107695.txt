Bought a new tv 2 months ago with a 2 year warranty... Best buy would not replace it as i was told. They wanted to repair it but couldnt, so they replaced it with a new one of a smaller size and charged me 90% of the warranty.. Bottom line... I received a smaller tv and they charged an additional warranty... I will no longer shop or recommend their organization to others... This is nothing but a con job to their customers... Walmart will get my business from now on... Return policy with no questions asked.... BEST BUY IS A CON AND RIP OFF.....
