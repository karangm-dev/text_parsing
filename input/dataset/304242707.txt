Ikea Sucks!!!I already bought about 10 ENJE Roller Blind and I needed 10 more. After talking to employees I was told that They will restock that item every week and I went to Ikea two more time. Finally , I was told this item will not be available in their store till October and most likely I have to order it on line and the only store in whole United State will accept order on line or on the phone is the one is located in Houston, TX.I did call them and after being 20 minutes on the phone they told me you have to order on line. So I go online and try to order and I receive the email that they will get back to me after 10 days. After 10 days they say that they can not send my order because of their policy. Long story short, I called them today on Tuesday and talked to store manager name Glen in the Atlanta Store and Told him that I will drive over 250 miles to pick what I need and explained him all the story. He acts like it is not a big deal and told me that he is not able to put those item on hold for me. I wish from the first I did not shop with this stupid Swedish company with their F***ed up stupid rules. I will not recommend this store to anyone.
