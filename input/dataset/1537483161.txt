There are only TWO places in the whole United States where you can actually walk into a Manolo Blahnik store.  This is one of them.There were so many beautiful shoes I could hardly control myself.I didn't make a purchase this day, but for a very good reason.   After walking around Vegas for a few days, ones feet tend to get swollen.  I didn't want to spend that amount of money only to have the shoes not fit properly when I got home.These shoes are so HOT.  Every girl needs a few pair!
