Let me tell you, the food here is amazing. The customer service is terrible. I have been here 4 times and 3 times they have messed something up. CHECK YOUR FOOD BEFORE YOU LEAVE! Last time I ordered wings and a pizza, they made wings but not the pizza. The time before that I was told 25 mins to come pick up. I get there and I have to wait an additional 20 more mins because they weren't ready, I'm guessing they messed up someone else's order. On top of that my 1/4 sheet was missing one of my toppings. Today, I ordered a pizza and wings w/fries. I check my order, the pizza has the wrong toppings and the wings don't have fries. This place is really frustrating bc the food is awesome! Unfortunately the staff can't be trusted to do anything right. Ironically there is always different people working every time. They will fix the mistakes but by the time I get home my wings or my pizza is cold and nasty. Just get it right the first time! Is that to much to ask? If I'm going to OVERPAY for food I need to have it done right. Unfortunately they will be losing what was a loyal customer. I guess this NYer has to go find decent pizza else where. CHECK YOUR ORDERS people.
