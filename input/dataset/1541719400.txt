Only reason I stopped in was because I wanted the Lorac mega pro palette 2 and Sephora doesn't carry Lorac anymore. I purchased the palette and when I got home the entire thing was covered in gold shadow, one of the shadows was broken and spilled everywhere.I had to go back the next day and when I mentioned the need for the exchange I didn't even get an apology, she just said "make sure you check this one" which I had already done.I also noticed that the Lorac section had a sign that stated a gift with purchase, when I mentioned it to her she said "we ran out of the gifts" not even giving me eye contact. I then told her, well then I suggest you take down the sign...to which she didn't reply.It upsets me because this is a 60.00 eyeshadow palette (that's not cheap) and they act like they're doing you a favor. I know retail during the holidays is tough but they are like this year round. The customer service at this location is horrible, I'd rather go to Sephora or order online. I'm not dealing with their attitude anymore.
