Area was decent but the apartments are outdated. Thin walls, cheap wooden doors have about an inch and half open area from the bottom when they are closed. Don't get an upstairs apt that has vaulted ceilings with glass windows because it gets so hot in the summer time that your AC will never shut off and your apt will never cool off. The sun is literally blazing in your eyes. Be prepared to get charged an arm and a leg when you leave. Don't nail anything into the wall unless you want a huge bill mailed to you when you're long gone.
