Our daughter was married in December 2012 at The Phoenix Art Museum.  We used Mark at Angelic Grove for the decor at the ceremony as well as the reception.We met with Mark a couple of times to describe the look we were hoping to create.  Mark's interpretation and execution of the design, far exceeded our expectation.  He and the team at Angelic Grove created an incredibly tasteful ambiance.  The space was transformed into sheer beauty,  that was enjoyed and praised by many.Thanks to Mark and his team we will cherish the memories of the day for many years to comeWith gratitude from the entire wedding party
