NOTHING SPECIAL about this place..their fries are stringy..burgers are small and flavorless..I brought my kids and they wouldnt eat..I hate Mc donalds and burger king but I would have rather eaten there..and my bill was $30 bucks!NEVER AGAIN!.In & out is way better and cheaper..sorry Freddys try again..your burgers are over cooked and dry.
