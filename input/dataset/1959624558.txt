Let me start by saying OMG!! This is by far the best ice cream place ever!! They make their own ice cream right then and there!! The display is so appealing! The taste is amazingly good!! I had the strawberry yogurt and it was just delicious!! Please go there and try!! You won't be disappointed !! I promise!!
