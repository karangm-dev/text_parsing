I was recently in Phoenix with my husband for business. Although our hotel had a workout facility, I prefer classes over treadmills. We love our YMCA so I thought I would find a local YMCA near our hotel. Chris town YMCA was the closest and I could visit 5 times for free. I got a copy of their class schedule. Total Body Conditioning was listed! Perfect! At home, this is a 45 class that whips my butt weekly. We work every muscle group plus add cardio and by the time class is over, I am dripping wet. But I've learned that not all YMCA's are alike- nor are the classes- even though they are called the same thing. I realize now that Phoenix is a huge retirement community. I was the youngest by far of anyone in the class. It didn't start on time, it lasted 1 hour and when it was over, I did not need a shower! We did a lot of work on our balance- which is important I suppose in your 70's. I'm not trying to be rude- the people were very friendly and kind. It just wasn't the experience I was expecting. Needless to say, I did not go back. If you are 50 or under, fit and active and looking for a place to work-out while in the area, look elsewhere.
