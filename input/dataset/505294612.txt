BEST BUFFET thus far. I've been to Spice Market at Planet Hollywood, Paradise at Fremont Street, Luxor & Excalibur buffets, MGM & also Harras Hotel Buffet. Again...Mirage has the BEST I've had. I came here with my bf, brother, & his gf. they all say they same thing, as they had MGM & Paradise before. I went to every section, from, Latin, Asian, American, etc... Each section, I grabbed AT LEAST one thing from each different culture food. They have lots of desserts too. I'm so happy this place is part of myVegas slots. Definitely happy about that, because I can use my points to get buy one, get one free buffet, or if I have enough points, I can get 2 Buffets for FREE here. Worth using my points here to get the BEST buffet. When visiting Vegas, especially for the first time, you MUST eat here...
