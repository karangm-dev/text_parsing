I probably will only dine here again if a friend invited me to join them. I never stepped foot inside of the restaurant because I was meeting a small group of friends and they were already seated outside when I showed up. This has nothing to do with anything, but I really wish I hadn't worn jeans and worn my hair down without bringing something to tie my hair away from my neck...it was only 9am and I was sweating...but at least our kids could run and play without disturbing anyone because we were the only ones with the "bright" idea to sit outdoors. SO ANYWAY, I have no idea what the inside of the restaurant looks like...nope, didn't even use their restroom while I was there. Although I had a good time being there because I was with my friends and it's always a pleasure to be in good company, I'm not a fan of this place because I wasn't impressed with the food. The prices were pretty standard and the portion size was fair but the presentation was sloppy. I ordered 'The Classic': two eggs cooked how you want them, breakfast potatoes, bacon or sausage, toast or a banana nut muffin, I chose scrambled hard, turkey sausage and the muffin. My eggs were definitely scrambled hard...overcooked for everyone else, but for me it was fine...my potatoes were over salted and a bit dry, I was given turkey bacon instead of the sausage I asked for but I didn't ask to fix the order because I like turkey bacon but it was overcooked and my muffin was kind of strange looking but that didn't bother me. None of my food came out hot...or even kind of warm for that matter. Not much to boast about this place.
