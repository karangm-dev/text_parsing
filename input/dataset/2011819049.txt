I have to admit, I was a bit skeptical about working with an organization which I had always thought was the "fast food" of lenders. Boy was I wrong!! From my initial contact with Corey, and throughout the process with Sean, everything went fantastic. I have had home loans and refinanced many times over the years, and never has the process gone so smooth. Pretty much everything was completed online and Esigned. The appraisal was completed and turned in quickly, and the closing was conducted at my home so I did not have to go out of my way to sign the papers. I can't say enough great things about this company. I even recommended them to my daughter who is now going through the same process.I believe that many issues can arise from the homeowner not being prepared or not providing the necessary documentation. Whatever the case, I was able to lower my monthly payment and receive additional funding through the equity built up in my home for a remodel. Would definitely recommend these guys.
