Went there as my phone screen crashed.  Got my so called fixed phone after two days with a screen, with lot of scratches... Soooo unsatisfied.. Waiting for the monday to come and gonna ask the inspecturgadget guys to fix this issue.. If they are not, i need to take some severe action. Sooo worst service. I WILL NEVER GO HERE AGAIN.. Its high time for them to close their business...
