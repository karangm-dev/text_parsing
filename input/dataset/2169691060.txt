Mmmmm, potstickers, buns, dumplings, meat pies.  I can't get enough.  And less than 1 mile from my house!  Where have you been all my life Chou? And my favorite was the eggplant stirfry with potatoes and jalapenos.  Wow!  The service is great, the 2 women that took our order and brought the food were nice and funny.   Where else can you get a waitress that tells my 5 year old that he needs to drink water instead of juice because juice will make him "fluffy"  (how sweet and PC) and his belly will get big?  Or how about when the other lady asked me if I had been to China, and when I indicated I hadn't she told me "you don't need to go, you come here".  So good food with a side of comedy.  My new favorite restaurant.
