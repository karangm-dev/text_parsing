I signed up for classes and was excited to start when there was a sudden death in the family which means I will be unable to stay in the state. I called and asked about a refund and was informed of a 14 day policy. I called on the 14th day, so I was still safe. The woman on the phone told me to email some address so I did and got no response. Called again and asked to spoke to a manager and she refused so I continued to email this address for 2 weeks and got no response. I finally had to call Visa and dispute the charge which has now opened an investigation. The woman on the phone (who answers every time is beyond rude). If you care about being treated well when companies take your money (in other words, customer service) go elsewhere.
