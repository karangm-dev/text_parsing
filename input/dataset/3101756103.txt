I should give 0 star to this location!!! Kidding me? Calling for half an hour while driving around, and then being told to park my car first, and walk in to rent the car?!  On the phone with a guy all the way looking for a tiny little cardboard written the name in the end.. What the hell!!! No sign outside, no instructions, WTF!!Stay away from this, if you don't want to waste your time, and ruin your vacation!!
