I've been here twice now for lunch.  First time I got a double burger, fried pickles, and a root beer float.  The float was delicious.  The fried pickles were very tasty, though quite salty, and the burger was not very good.  The meat was ground very fine and tasted like some sort of weird meatloaf.  Generally when meat is ground that fine it makes me wonder what is in it that they're trying to hide.Today I stayed away from the burger.  I had a veggie burger, a grilled chicken sandwich and fried macaroni and cheese (I just had to try it).  The mac and cheese was good, for fried boxed mac and cheese.  The veggie burger was obviously out of a box and not homemade, but tasted decent.  The "grilled chicken breast" was neither grilled nor a breast.  The meat was super processed chicken meat (used loosely) pressed together in a spongy breast shape then warmed up on a flat burner.  I couldn't even finish it b/c it grossed me out.Basically, they seem like a nice ice cream place, but the food is unfortunately not good at all.
