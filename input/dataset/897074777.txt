Worst fucking people I've ever dealt with lol. Luis is nice, James is a dick head who tricked me into something I didn't need done. He made it sound urgent and like the other mechanics I had talked to YESTERDAY, had given me false advice. I hear they do this a lot, unfortunately it was too late for me to change my mind on the services. Please don't go here, they're sketchy and untrustworthy. JW auto took care of me and were so genuine. I will never go to Midas again. OH GUESS WHAT GUYS!!! These inconsiderate disgraceful men just called me to let me know they forgot to give me a free oil change voucher for my next visit. Synthetic oil for my 2005 Car. WHICH I DONT FUCKING NEED. These men are worthless. Watched me cry about the pricing and still went ahead and made up that I had to get my rotors replaced. I was at a mechanics just yesterday who said my rotors were fine. And to add to this- they didn't even tell me why my rotors were needing to be replaced, didn't show me any wear, just pressed about the fact that they needed to be replaced. They're scum bags DO NOT TRUST THESE SKETCHY ASSES THEY JUST WANT YOUR MONEY!!!!
