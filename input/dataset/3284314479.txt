Angel and his crew did an AMAZING job on our outdoor kitchen project!! They were patient when the general contractor was behind schedule and stayed in contact with us until the time was right. Installation was perfect and they nailed the waterfall edge. Many people cannot believe there is a seam, its flawless! We'll definitely use them again and tell our friends and family about Vegas Granite!
