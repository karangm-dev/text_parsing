Lack of attention to detail.  Wtf, with the shower drain cover?? Yeah, I want myself or my family to slice our foot open in the shower so we can spend our time limping around with stitches.  There were numerous details that were missed, no pride in craftsmanship throughout.  Management is obviously not held accountable for quality.  They need to go through the rooms and punch list their rooms.  Misaligned faucets, crooked wall hangings, a makeup light tied to the bathroom light switch so you can't have a night light to assist aim on a middle of the night pee instead you have to turn on the bright bathroom light and burn in your retina.  We left our first nights room service in the hall the next day and a piece of plastic wrap was left on the ground, it was still there the day we left.  Little things add up.  At least we had a nice view of a wall and a pigeon.  I use to hold the Westin chain in such high regard but after a couple big fumbles like moldy caulking in bath tubs, visible mildew in the AC etc in their other hotels I'm very disappointed.  There were a couple pros, the staff was nice and the AC was quiet.  If you get in late and need to eat then prepare to be bummed with the late night room service grub, it just was not good.
