This company knows how to hire their help! I always used Ryan, but he left so they scheduled Todd C. Not only was he professional. But, he was very patient and explained absolutely everything. He even cost effected my options. Customer servicee is something that is disappearing, but not at Sierra. Thank you Sierra for keeping me cool/warm. I have had you twice a year for 5 years and will continue, and shout kudos to everyone I know!
