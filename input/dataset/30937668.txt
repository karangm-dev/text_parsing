My car was having a problem and they said it was probably the water pump so I went to arrowhead Lexus because it was closest to me at the time. After checking the car and what needed to be done they decided it was the water pump and quoted me $1300 for the water pump. I checked another dealership in Scottsdale and they quoted me $850.00 for a water pump. Then I told the arrowhead Lexus who was Ramero that I had gotten a quote from the Scottsdale Lexus dealership for $850. for a water pump and he told me there was a glitch in the system and that is why I got a lower quote there,and that he knew how many hours it took to put in a water pump and that's why his was higher. He said also that after checking with his supervisor they would honor the Scottsdale Lexus price.  I will never go back to that Lexus dealer I feel that they try to cheat you and get the highest price possible out of you and they're a big rip off! If I hadn't checked with another Lexus dealer I would have been paying 1300 for water pump!!!
