Out of my entire first visit to Las Vegas, eating at this restaurant was about the only mistake we made. I understand the concept of purposely obnoxious staff, as I've been to restaurants that take a similar approach, and enjoyed the experience in the past, but like everything American, they were just trying way too hard. No creativity, no wit; it was like watching a terribly acted movie. Our waitress was barely tolerable; nice at times, but far too loud.On top of this, the restaurant was unnecessarily noisy, the cutlery was dirty, the drinks were piss-poor and WAY too expensive, and the food was also too pricey for what we got, which, for a few of us ended up being indigestion. Would not return.
