I can't comment on the hotel property as I was unable to stay. I can comment on awful customer services.  I made a reservation through Hotels.com accidentally instead of the Airport Radisson.  The response from the hotel when I try to call and address this problem is that they are too busy to deal with my concerns or call me back.Also, I won't be using any service like Hotels.com. If Radisson doesn't like how these travel arrangements work, then they perhaps shouldn't either. Everyone one points fingers at the other party and insists you have to contact them.
