Wow! I had the best experience I have ever had at a salon in AZ. I am very, very particular about my hair and the way it is cut. I will be honest and say I was a bit apprehensive to try this salon, however they had good reviews and a Groupon (and I had about 2 inches worth of split ends) so I tried it. I was so happy with Cheryl - she listened to what I wanted, made fabulous suggestions, and the results were fantastic. I will definitely be back, and suggest this salon to anyone looking. Thanks, Salon Zen and Cheryl for a fabulous experience and cut - I will be back again!
