There are plenty of better theaters around the valley, service for getting snacks, slow. Seats are comfortable, but there are way more comfortable seats in different movie theaters. Would skip going here, the AMC in town square is much better and and it's the same ticket price. Skip this movie theater, but don't skip the movies!!
