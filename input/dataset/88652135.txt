A Real Guy Place!I know Sportclips, which I patronize also, touts itself as a guy's place, but I feel more like a man after leaving Downtown Vintage Barbershop. I've been here twice now and with each of the barbers. I can honestly say I feel confident no matter who I get. Good all-around solid haircut with attention to detail. You can tell the young owner really cares about the place and wants to bring quality service to its patrons and is in it for the long-haul. Every time I pass by it seems there is always someone in the chair. Before this ownership it wasn't always the case. The Downtown Vintage Barbershop is a full service shop. A straight razor is used during the final trim so a real clean finish is the result. A single TV and mags adorn the place and some old-school music is playing in the background. Don't forget cash, as this place takes cold hard American Dollars in the form of Greenbacks only.
