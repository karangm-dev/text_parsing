Spent my last day  at LV by eatin at Garden Court buffet in Main Street Station. After the diabolical fiasco eatin at  Firelight buffet in Sam's Town.  I felt like I must  have hit the jackpot or  gone to heavenly bliss by accidentally venture into Garden Court Buffet! I visited Las Vegas two or three times annually and didn't discover this paradise until now. What an idiot on my part! I guess like most tourists coming to LV. We all got enticed and tourist trapped by the more expensive and classy promise eatery on the big strip. If you're on a budget or is a smart and savvy eater. This place will be a  new eatin sensory haven for u! They have all your typical buffet varieties, and some not so typical dishes which I have'nt seen in other buffets. For example, they have Peking Duck breast that are the size of  my fist. A station which cater to the Hawaiian and Filipino patrons. I thought that was a very nice touch and a smart concept, considering the amount of Asians visitin and livin there. My overall experience eatin here would only sum it up in two words. Wow!!!! Wow!!!! If U don't mind comin down to old downtown Fremont area. The Garden Buffet will be the most excellent choice to dine at. The scrumptious variety of fresh dishes and the too cheap to almost noting entrance fee just make everyone feel like a winner by eatin here. After all, Garden Court is the top five buffets voted in Vegas. So what are U waiting for? It took me 15 yrs to discover this gem! It is now my top number one buffet in Viva Vegas! Happy eatin folks!
