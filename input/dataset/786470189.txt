Been here over a dozen times and I don't know why we keep going back but we do. The last time we where there the hostess was so rude. I'm with my daughter who needed to go the restroom and my husband was behind me. I asked him to get a table and I will meet you. When I returned and asked the hostess where she sat my husband and son? Her answer was "oh I don't remember but you can walk around and look" now remember I'm with a small child carrying her. I thought how rude to just point to the area of the restaurant and send me away. Now it wasn't busy to where she could help me look but she didn't she decided to return to her conversation with the other 3 hostess.
