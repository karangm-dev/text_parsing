I went in as a new customer and looking for a haircut.   Breyon was great! I highly recommend for guys sick of getting chopped up at sportclips,  great clips, etc.  They will negotiate and say Ohh my boss is going to get me in trouble. .. so the prices seem high but ask to pay less... well worth it.
