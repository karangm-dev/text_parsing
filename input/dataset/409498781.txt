My most favorite place to have worked out of 20 years on and off in the industry! Owners and management are family, not just bosses  military friendly  Also, best patio around! Puppy dog friendly with a special K9 menu. Chef Marc kicks ass in the kitchen, and you can enjoy yourself in a chill dining room or lively bar area with kick ass monkey cocktails, and the patio is a great mix of everything. Opening for lunch, and adding live music at night has been a great addition. It's fun no matter what time you go, and that's not just my biased opinion speaking. This is a must have on the regular visit list. Ginger Monkey is here to stay!!!
