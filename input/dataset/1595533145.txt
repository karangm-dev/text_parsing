As good as it gets..Worth every penny..we went with my coworkers on Friday for dinner..its a nice atmosphere for a buffet place and perfect ambiance..spacious, friendly ,Kids playroom, VIP room, fresh fortune cookie.. lots of choices in food (Teppanyaki, Sushi bar,Salad bar, Dessert bar, Hot Table) and like how they cook it in front..we rarely see any buffet places cooking in front and the freshness of the ingredients..will be back
