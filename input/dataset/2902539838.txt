Does anyone else use AJ's salad bar and beautiful patio for lunch or dinner as often as I do? I love the fresh salad bar! They have great iced tea and if your in the mood for soup, Voila'. Their Bistro has a full selection of hot meals as well. I just love a full salad bar at my disposal. If it's sweets you desire, you won't find a bigger selection. Fast friendly service and you can always pick an item or two up on your list for dinner tonight.
