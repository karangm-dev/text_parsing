Sorry I rather go to Panda Express. Although lady staff first welcome us was not really nice, friendly, or polite, the waiter was nice, friendly and well-mannered.  We had a fried rice, a wanton noodle soup, and an eggplant dish.  Fried Rice was good, but sorry overall food tastes blunt. It is NOT fast-food style Chinese restaurant, but unfortunately not even at par as a restaurant.
