After a near disaster with an inexperienced plumber who was going to charge us $350.00 to install our new R/O system, we sent out for a quote on the internet to have a Reverse Osmosis system installed .   The only company to respond was Rain Water Conditioning.   They quoted us less than half of what the other plumber quoted for the install, and we set it up for the next day.   Doug was our installer.   He was prompt, pleasant, extremely experienced, and got the install done in under an hour.   I was so happy with his work that I asked about the Rain water conditioning systems and he gave us prices.   I will definitely be using them in the future for a new water conditioning system.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY.
