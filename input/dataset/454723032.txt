Texas road house is a huge chain and most people know the drill. The place is mainly known for the atmosphere.... everyone can pretty much say the food is eh ok the rolls are amazing but again the food is just ok. This review is literally based on one waitress Amanda! She has been for the last 2 years of my daughters birthday and she is absolutely amazing! She makes my daughter feel super special and I honestly can't thank her enough. Today I wanted to make sure everyone knew how amazing she is! Thanks Amanda!!!!!
