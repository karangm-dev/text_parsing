From the guy at the carving station guarding an over cooked unmarbled piece of meat like he had to feed  500 people on it, to the sickly, unpeeled mini shrimp, you would think the bathroom would be closer than 50+ yards away. 1 star for descent dessert bar, but the savory selection of mishandled mess should shut this place down soon.  Came to see Ralphie May. The saving grace for this otherwise entirely mismanaged property.
