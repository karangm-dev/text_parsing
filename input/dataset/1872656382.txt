First time at this Osmow's and ordered a medium half & half chicken shawarma.  Portion was a lot smaller than I expected.  For $9.25 + tax I expected more.  The chicken was extra lemony and shredded up so much it was like someone chewed up already.  I asked for mild and got 3 little dots of hot sauce.  3 dots? For this price they could've at least given me a full line.  I ordered it to-go so I didn't know until I got home.  Garlic sauce was good - that's about it.  I won't be back (at least not to this location)
