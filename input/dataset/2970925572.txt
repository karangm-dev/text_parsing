Baylee Burrows is awesome at Quicken Loans. She provided superior customer service and stayed on top of my loan account from start to finish. Checked in weekly and made sure all my questions were answered. Never made me feel bad about asking too many questions maybe even repetitive questions. I've mortgaged 3 times with them and each time is better than the last. Fair costs and good rates, always some credit for being a returning client. Thank you!!
