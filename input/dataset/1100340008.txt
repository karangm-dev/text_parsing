Oh my goodness.... where to start?!! I had the pleasure of enjoying some BBQ chicken, beans and potato salad about a week ago. Not only was the meat perfectly tender and juicy, but the beans, oh my god the beans. Talk about perfection. On top of the delicious food, the service I received was beyond 5 stars. I was offered a sample while working and was told he could bring the food into me at my convenience but I didn't take advantage assuming that I would be able to catch him outside and take a look at my options. Unfortunately for me as I was walking out of the building Steven was pulling away. He saw me though, and as I expressed my sadness in missing my opportunity. He so kindly and without hesitation pulled over and prepared me the dish of my choosing. He was so gracious and even gave me a small story of how he got started. I would recommend Holy Smoke BBQ to ANYONE and EVERYONE! My heart and my belly were so full! Thank you again for your extremely generous service!
