I have not one qualm to announce about this TJ's! Not a single qualm.Parking is available via two lots (one off Monroe, the other off Spooner). Carts are always tidy, never massively dumped and sprawled in the parking lots or in the streets. The store is so tidy and well-maintained. Staff are always on top of tasks and helpful, friendly 95% of the time, and many come to recognize you after recurring visits!Produce is decent quality and I always find what I need. Specialty, holiday, and seasonal promotions are always fun too:  pizza crust dough, my summer iced coffee concentrate and winter holiday panettone! YUM!A hidden gem IMHO:  tea tree infused body care items. Body wash. Face scrub. Face/Skin cleansing pads. Oil. I'm drinking the TJ's tea tree kool-aid!I would head local for something like coffee beans, though.
