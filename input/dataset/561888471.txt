Second time they've cleaned my house, and I will say they do extra things that most companies won't do or will charge extra for.  For example when they clean your carpets, they will use stain and degreaser to remove carpet stains from heavy walk areas as part of their standard cleaning.  Likewise, they vacuum your carpets before they begin the cleaning process.  They also use a heavy duty circular carpet cleaning machine that scrubs out dirt and carpet stains.  Again this is all part of their standard cleaning.  Also its the little things they do like wiping down water spots off floor when they leave.  Things that I assume every carpet cleaning does, but many actually don't.There are lots of cleaning services in las vegas.  I've learned the hard and cheap way you get what you pay for.  Rhino has reasonable prices, and their cleaning services are second to none that I've found.  Once I find a company that is like that I'm a loyal customer.
