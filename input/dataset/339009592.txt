Chenin did the braces for both of my boys, and they loved it there. The doctors are amazing, the office staff is friendly & makes you feel like family. The waiting room is fun and inviting for kids of all ages. And that's not even counting the amazing work they did on their teeth! My youngest Josh started the process with a head gear, in 2009 I think it was, and just finished his Invisalign and his teeth look amazing! My oldest was 19 when he started his, it's definitely a place for kids of all ages. So If you are looking for a place for braces for your kids or even for yourself definitely check out Chenin Orthodontics!
