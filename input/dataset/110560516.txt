This is a legit NY pizza. I am from NY and the owner cares about his product. I only eat his pizza, have not tried other items. The location is hard to find, but who cares.  Long Island Neil.I have been going here very often.Vinnie makes a good pizza. Good crust, good ingredients, good sauce. You have to be a scmuck to not agree. I checked Vinnie and his products out. I sell food products, 20,000. Vinnie buys top quality, and knows his way around a pizza oven.Case closed..
