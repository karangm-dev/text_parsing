I will never come to this store again, and I will never give either store my business again. I used to always go to the one up on Thunderbird and never really had a problem with how the animals were kept.. With the exception of the Guinea pigs and rabbits being in large troughs on the floor within reach of children that don't necessarily know how to respect animals & having animals that are being boarded within reach of the public as well. Besides that, I had no complaints and the staff were always wonderful there. About 3 weeks ago, I went to the Glendale branch and was appalled. Upon walking in, they have baby chicks in towers with feed trays surrounding the outside of them for them to stick their heads through to eat.. Only one of the chicks had escaped the pen and was teeter on the edge on one of the high feed platforms. Alarmed I ran over and asked my boyfriend to stand by it to make sure it didn't fall while I went and got a staff member. I grabbed a young man who seemed less than interested in what I just told him and was incredibly non-chalet. I then walked out to the back part outside where there were goats/pigs/peacocks ect. There were too many animals crammed into one pen and one worker was hosing (with a garden hose) down the pigs and goats to keep them cool (as AZ summers are 115). There's no reason to keep SO many animals in one pen, especially in this kind of heat. I was not at all fond of common pigeons being for sale for $2.00 either. Overall, after my experience at the Glendale location, I don't want Pratt's to have my business at all because animal welfare is clearly not a top priority there. Very disappointing.
