I visited Dr. Stowell looking for replacement hormone therapy for testosterone.  After he took blood samples, he advised me of a regime of testosterone injections weekly.  He said it was the best approach to my situation.  For seven weeks I went for weekly testosterone injections.  After the seventh week, I had a severe reaction, could not eat, could not work, and became very ill.  When I called Dr. Stowell and told him I was ill, he was surprised as if he was just giving me a water soluble vitamin, as opposed to a very strong steroid.  When I asked him how much testosterone he had given me, he did not even have good records in his system, did not know how many times he injected me, could not even pronounce the precise name of the drug he gave me, and finally told me he gave me 150mg per injection.  I had to go to my own records to determine that I had 7 injections.  I immediately went to a traditional MD.  We discovered my testosterone levels exceeded the normal levels by 300% and that I was suffering from a toxic reaction to excessive levels well past the ability of the body to handle.  According to the traditional MD, an excellent doctor, Dr. Stowell failed to take into account both the half-life of testosterone in the system (meaning the time it takes for the body to eliminate prior injections before giving new ones) and my age (I am 64).  I should have had a lesser number of injections, more time lapsed between injections, and a small dosage per injections. The net result was an excess build up of testosterone and a dangerously toxic reaction that took me 8 months to recover.  Foolishly, I trusted Dr. Stowell that he know what he was doing. This fellow should not be dispensing drugs or writing prescriptions to patients.  Clearly he should stick to being a chiropractor and dispensing vitamins.
