The gelato at this location is great; however their customer service is some of the worst I have ever come across. Their workers completely rush you and if you decide to taste a flavor they completely bypass you and go to the next person. That is not acceptable for any business. Teach your employees to treat customers like customers not a nuisance. Your customers are the reason you stay in business.
