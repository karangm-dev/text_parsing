Very disappointed. This place used to be very good. Went for Friday dinner and food was complete disappointment. Very limited selections. Claims that it has international selections but not much to choose from. Food was warm or cold, messy food selection area, poor service, etc...asked multiple times about the cotton candy but person who makes it said he was busy. Never again! It's about $30 for weekend dinner, but it's not worth it. Hometown buffet has more selections than here.
