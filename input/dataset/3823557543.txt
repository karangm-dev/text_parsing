I cam here with my cousins and really enjoyed myself. The ambiance is great, the restaurant is spacious, the service is great, and the food delivery was very quick. I got the gnocchi which was delicious and a perfect amount of food for one person! While the plates are meant to be shared, all of my cousins ordered the french onion soup, which they all said was really good!
