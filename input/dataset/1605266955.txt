Drinks were alright but service was definitely lacking. Stopped in today with a friend and had drinks sitting at the bar. I had the South of the Border cocktail that was pretty good, although I'm not sure if I'd order it again for $13. But the major thing that factored into my rating is that the bartender seemed annoyed we were even there. My friend and I commented on how she didn't smile once the entire time we were there and hardly said a word, until the very end as we left and she greeted a guy sitting down by himself. Maybe it was just us? Not sure but based on today's visit I definitely don't plan on going back.
