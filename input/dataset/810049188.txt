A friend of mine recommended Cafe Monarch after attending a Sunday Brunch. We went for dinner with a group of 6, and we had a great time! The food was fantastic, the service was great, and it is truly a unique dining experience. I've never seen or heard of anything else like it. The restaurant is charming, and Christopher is very sweet and hugely talented. I cannot gush enough about this place, so I'll keep it simple: YOU MUST GO HERE!Details: For dinner, Chris offered one starter (an amazing summer salad), two entrees (pork and salmon) and two desserts (orange cheesecake that I will never forget and a pastry with chocolate gelatto). The price was $45, pre fixe, and the cost for corking wine was $10 per bottle, and $1 per beer. CASH ONLY! Overall, the night was pricey ($120 for two people), but definitely worth it for a special night out with friends, or an important occasion.
