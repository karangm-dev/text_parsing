My wife already wrote a review, but I feel very offended, as well.  I went into RC Willey on Stephanie to purchase a new dishwasher.  After 20 minutes of attempting to make eye contact with a sales person who was too busy watching TV and conversing with his co-workers, my wife was upset and insisted we leave.  I feel I was discriminated against because of my sexual orientation.  I have never been treated like this before in RC Willey and has spent at least $10k in products and services.  I can't believe this just happened.  We will not be returning.  Come on RC Willey, we have money to spend just like the straight people.
