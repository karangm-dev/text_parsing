My first time trying this food outside of Vegas strip. All the way from LA to Vegas for this food what can I say? I'm a picky person when that's comes to Vietnamese food why? Probably because I'm a Vietnamese person as well and know my food? Lol.Anyways the food was really good I will defiantly go back here next time I'm coming back to Vegas!
