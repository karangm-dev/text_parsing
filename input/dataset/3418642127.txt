I needed an DeLongi Coffe and Expresso maching repaired... Call Complete Appliance and asked if they do small machines... They said to bring in and they will look at it to see if the tech could  help me... They explained there would be a charge of 39,50 to check the machine.  If they could fix it, they would apply this amount towards the total price.     After over two weeks , I called and was told the gentleman was out and he would call me when he got back... Never received a call.   I finally reached him a few days later and he said that they were not an autorized DeLongi Dealer(  which I knew and they knew going into this)   DeLongi would not help them with the problem.. Therefore, no repair,, pick up your machine.I finally sent the machine to Michigan, where is was repaired.   I was upset that I wasted all this time and money at Complete.  Spoke to Manager and was not spoken to in a professional manner... were short with me.   I asked for the moeny back, since that should have not taken a machine to be repaired when they were not capable of handling the problem.   Would not use this company again!
