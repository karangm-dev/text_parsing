The nicest people you will ever meet. I ama doctor's wife and a horrible, high stress patient. From Leslie at the front desk who chatted me upto distract me to Patrick the nurse who did a perfect job despite my needle phobia to Mary Ann and Lois who got me relaxed and were total sweethearts about it to Dr. Ramzan who took great care, 10/10 team.
