this was some of the worst chinese food i've ever had. everything i ordered was incredibly salty. the tofu was not cooked very well and the fried rice, aside from being too salty, was rather bland. plus they didn't throw in any spicy mustard.on the plus side, the food was pretty cheap, and the delivery was free and quick.this place might be good in a pinch, but otherwise seek out better chinese options.
