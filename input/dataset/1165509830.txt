My boyfriend and I were really looking forward to a couple's massage on our vegas trip this memorial day weekend. I researched a lot of spas and reviews before choosing Episage, and I'm so glad I made the right decision. First of all, I called 5 different times to see if I could reschedule our appointment since our flight and times wouldn't allow us to make our original one. Each time they tried to find a new opening for us, and even a few hours before we went they scheduled us on a Sunday after I called. Nikki and Limmie were our therapists. They went above and beyond expectations for a massage!! They set the music to that that would fit my bf and I perfectly. They taught us (mistly my bf) all about tight and knotted fascia and stretching. Limmie went through a number of stretches and flexibility therapies on me. They had us laughing and having a good time the entire session, and we got educated without even realizing we were getting educated. My boyfriend is making sure he's stretching and treating his body better now after the session with Nikki and Limmie, and I now can't wait to come back to Vegas just to go see them for another massage! Best hour and a half ever! You won't be disappointed!!
