I'm coming out of my Yelp-review-writing retirement to lavish praise on this fine establishment.Food was great, blah blah blah, but here's what's prompting this: on a recent family trip to Toronto, we had promised our 3.5 year old a milkshake. Nowhere nearby had milkshakes. The shitty McDonald's across the street did not have milkshakes that day (broken machine, I presume). Easy was rude and dismissive when we asked. We needed food and talked our son into getting a milkshake later, but he was clearly bummed and there was a better than good chance a meltdown would happen any minute.So do you know what the ladies working that day did? WENT TO THE GODDAMN CORNER STORE, BOUGHT ICE CREAM, AND MADE OUR SON AN AMAZING MILKSHAKE!Seriously, that is ridiculously awesome, nice, and greatly appreciated. Way above and beyond.Bravo, ladies of Cardinal Rule working that Monday lunch shift, bravo.
