My husband had the egg, bacon  and cheese sandwich & I had the slut!! Yummm! Everything I hoped it would be & more! We were both hungover from a long night of partying Vegas style & this meal really hit the spot! There was a long line, but so worth the wait. If you like eggs & breakfast  try this spot you won't be disappointed .
