Seems like it would be pretty hard for a gas station to earn a one star rating, right? Well, at least one pump has a non-functioning auto-shutoff system. When I talked to an employee about it, he said I "should have been paying attention". I didn't realize more attention had to be payed to a gas pump than holding it until it shut off automatically. I don't mean it shut off and I kept holding it down, it never shut off once. Enjoy your 1 star!
