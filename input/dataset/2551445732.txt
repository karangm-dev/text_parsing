This place is a GREAT alternative to Tacos El Gordo. In fact, I think this place is much better than Tacos El Gordo. First, the actual venue is very nice. It is very clean, open and hip. I love how they have a line to separate the different meats you want in your tacos/burritos/quesadillas.  Closer to the cash register, is a bar and another line to order fries, nachos, corn, etc... The food is delicious but I've only had Carne Asada tacos and Carne Asada fries. I have yet to try the corn and other meats. I'm sure they all taste great as they look delicious on everyone else's plates. The venue also has a condiments area in the middle which is very very hearty with salsas, veggies and a few other fresh accompaniments to your food. Lastly, the staff is very nice. I especially love the lady that serves in the line where you order your sides and extras (fries, corn, nachos, etc...). She is amazing!
