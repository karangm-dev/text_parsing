, I gave this place several chances, but this past Sunday was it for us.  Mind you the service was good. The food on the other hand was just horrible, horrible. The green beans are canned w/ way to much seasoning and Soggy. I ordered the patty melt and the meat felt like card board with absolutely no flavor, the rye bread was so soggy that it was stuck on the meat, but the edges where hard as a rock. This place has completely vanished from our choices to eat. Bye
