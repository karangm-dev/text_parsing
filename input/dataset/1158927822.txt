This restaurant was amazing. I made reservations for 6:00 so that I could order off their Santorini Menu which, IMO, is a kill deal. The phyllo stuffed feta was warm and drizzled with some honey, delish. Had the fried calamari and octopus and can I just say, the octopus blew me out of the water. It was so flavorful with the perfect amount of chew. Main course, went with the lobster pasta, nothing to write home about but was still very delicious. I highly recommend this place if you're looking for something other than your usual Vegas buffet or steakhouse.
