I love the atmosphere and the look of the space.  The service is also good; however, the food left me a little underwhelmed each time I visited.I eat a low carb gluten free diet, so was super stoked to learn that they had gluten free options.  I tried the gluten free pancakes: but it was a little bland.  In terms of trying to stay low carb, I felt like the majority of menu items were breaded except for the salads... and sometimes, a salad just won't do!So in short, while I do like the fact that they don't over-salt everything like many restaurants, their breakfast and lunch foods (gluten free and otherwise) that I tried were a little boring to the taste buds, not great for low carb folks, but good if you want a mimosa or a coffee with a friend.
