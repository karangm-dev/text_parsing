Last night we took out wonton soup & chicken chow mein. We could not eat the soup. The amount of salt in it was disgusting. I specifically ordered the chow mein with no garlic & light on the onions. They put sooo much garlic in it & onions that it was repeating on me all night. This has happened many times when we ordered food from there. My mom asked for no pepper in the shrimp with lobster sauce. There was tons of pepper in it. She can't eat spicy foods. There shouldn't be pepper in that dish anyway. My dad asked for low salt in the lo mein. Again they didn't listen & made it so salty. He is not allowed to have all that salt. We will not be going back there. I don't understand why they can't make the food the way we like it. Their menu says all dishes can be altered to your taste. I'm originally from ny/nj & I know how chinese food should taste.
