Every time I go to Vegas I must come to Olive Garden!  We went for a late lunch this past Sunday ( 3pm ) and I was surprised to see that they were busy.  I had the spaghetti with Italian sausage and of course we had to have those little donuts with the chocolate sauce!  Yummy.  We had a very funny waitress.  My only complaint is that we don't have an Olive Garden in Hawaii, not fair!!!  can't wait till we go back.
