This is probably my favorite location to go to! I've been to all in the valley & just recently ventured up to Kierland and had an amazing lunch. I love the patio and our waitress, Candice, was absolutely wonderful. So friendly, talkative, and just overly pleasant to be around AND super knowledgeable about the wines which I loved! I'm usually more of a full bodied wine drinker and was looking to try something new and she suggested the Periano, Petite Syrah, and I'm officially hooked! Thanks for a great experience - definitely will be back a lot!!
