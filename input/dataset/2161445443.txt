If it was possible to give no stars I would do so:Very unprofessional!Horrible experience with Mike on more than one occasion. Seems to me like they need to hire more people so that the staff they do have doesn't start yelling at customers by the end of the night. I was told he was on his way and he didn't show for another hour. Got screamed at when he did show up. And I was yelled at over the phone when I called to report him as well - seriously!On another occasion: No respect for time when you are in the shop wondering whether you should stay or go. Disregard for the customer in general and their need for information.From what I can tell these guys are only concerned with making a buck and will cut corners to do so. Starts with the owner and trickles down. Do not let AAA set you up with them - their incentives are misaligned.
