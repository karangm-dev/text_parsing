Whatever time you're reading this- come. Super cool place to hang out and have fun. We showed up at around 2:30am Sunday morning- games are free to play. If you need darts or a fooseball table ball just ask the bartender inside they'll hand it right over. Seriously though whether you're going on a date, you're in from out of town, or looking to take your friends from out of town to a cool spot- this is it. There's beer pong for 2 players or up to 6 in regular sized tables. A pitcher of beer is 18 bucks and they give you 4 balls and lots of cups for free. They also have massive beer pong where you play with huge (clean) trash cans and a soccer ball. Oh and no need to search for a place to grub after there's a 24 hour restaurant inside too! Chicken strips and fries were really good so was the pancake and chicken platter.
