My wife and her family have been patients of Dr. Brown for a long time, and I have been going for a couple of years now. The staff are very friendly and helpful, and they accommodate appointment changes when we need to make them- We live outside of the city but travel downtown for appointments. The office is always clean and professional, making it a nice experience overall. I would recommend this practice if you're looking for a talented, professional team to take care of your oral health.
