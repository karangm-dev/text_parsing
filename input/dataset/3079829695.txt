Gave this place another shot with my wife.  Food was ok, good wings.  The crowd herr is very strange.  There is a very clear group of older aged regulars that make this bar uncomfortable.  My wife and I almost felt unwelcomed and witness people  being asked to move (and leave!) to make room for them. The layout is also strange and isnt very good for large groups.  Theres many other better options within a mile...
