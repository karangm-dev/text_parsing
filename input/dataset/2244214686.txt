I got into a parking lot accident with my 2011 Cadillac and I was referred to take my car in for an estimate at AW Collision. I decided to go ahead and have them repair the bumper. After a week of my car being in the shop, I picked up my car and let me tell you... you couldn't even tell my car had been damaged at all. The bumper looked good as new! The staff here are very friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and they do an amazing job. From my experience, I would definitely recommend bringing your car here for repairs.
