Amazing!  My daughter and I went on Saturday for beignets, which were made to order and super tasty. Even better, we purchased some lemon, espresso and peach macaroons for later and those were so delicious!Obviously still gearing up (empty cases) but looking forward to the grand opening on July 9th.  What a wonderful shop for the downtown area!My only complaint is that there is not sufficient parking - this place will be super popular and there are only a few spots.
