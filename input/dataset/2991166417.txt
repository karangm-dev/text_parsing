The Il Purista sandwich has become a staple of my life. Mozzarella, basil, prosciutto, roasted red peppers and balsamic vinaigrette blend into a front runner for the best sandwich in the valley. Goes great with sparkling water or a beer. DeFalco's also has other Italian fare such as a delicious meatball sub and classic pastas.
