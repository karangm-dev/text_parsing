The minute I land in Pittsburgh, Pierogies Plus has to be my first stop. I love everything they do here and I love the huge amount of different Pierogies they have to offer. Because of them I have wandered away from my classic potato and cheese and now only get the spicy sausage pierogies. The fillings are plentiful, not to spicy, and the dough is perfect and not too thick. Prices are excellent and service window is prompt. I can think of no better place for me to stop while in Pittsburgh, Aloha
