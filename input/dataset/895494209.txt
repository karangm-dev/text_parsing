For the money I really was not too thrilled at the quality of the food.  I thought it was Asian Fusion cuisine, but it consisted mainly of Chinese fare.  We ordered 3 dishes:Ha Gow, shrimp dumplings dim sum $9, at least 2 shrimp fill these matte skins, YUM!  Pepper sauce beef stir fry $19, greasy, tenderized beef, not steak, w/grn bells, and onions. Malaysian chicken satay $7, oil was dripping off the dark meat chicken, spicy, but not mentioned on the menu.  The peanut sauce did not even have a hint of peanut flavor, more like sweet and sour. Other than the 4 massive, greaseless, ha gows, the rest tasted like cheap, greasy Chinese food served in a fabulous atmosphere, and tableware.
