I visited Burrito Boyz on my first night in Toronto largely because it was one of few sit down places open at 9:45pm on a Tuesday.  The menu is set up a lot like that of Chipotle where customers choose their meat, then the vessel (naked bowl, burrito, etc.) then the toppings and a hot, medium or mild sauce.  There  is also a choice between a small and large portion.  I chose a small chicken bowl, fully loaded, and  mild, my companion ordered the same thing but with steak.  We both found the meat to be fresh and well seasoned, but the bowls to be otherwise severely lacking in flavor.  We questioned whether the orange "cheese" sprinkled on top was real, as it was exceptionally bland and waxy and did not appear to melt.  We both ended up picking the meat out of the dishes and throwing the rest away.The actual ambience was cute enough.  Rectangular gray formica tables with metallic chairs, and a 90's throwback kitsch along the walls, and the music was all 1990's rap and R&B, which was fun.  The restaurant offered no wi-fi.
