When I used to smoke I stopped in here a few times for smokes. Literally EXACTLY the same as any other of the thousand smoke shops anywhere. Same smell, look, and energy. The reason for the low rating is I believe any smoke shop that sells vaping gear alongside smoking accessories and tobacco products is BS.
