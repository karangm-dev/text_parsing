I hate giving bad reviews but this place was terrible. I brought 2 Groupons and my boyfriend and I went and had a couples massage and both of our therapists did not do a good job. My had a guy do my massage and he barely touched me. When you first go in they have you fill out a form and I specifically wrote 'frim/hard touch" and it was softer than soft! My boyfriend had the same experience. The massage was less than Swedish. We left feeling frustrated and more tense then when we came in. Would not go back or recommend.
