Ok.. so I really wanted this place to be awesome and I totally want to give new restaurants a break while they get their footing- but this was ridiculous. The food was not very good and small portions. They "ran out" of their ingredients to the drink I ordered - one that was highlighted on their menu. And most frustratingly- they somehow put my son's' order on a separate ticket and it took 20 minutes AFTER the rest of the food arrived and no attempt to make it right by comping, or offering a dessert for the wait. We barely saw out waitress. For a new business to mess up and not ever try to apologize to customers doesn't bode well. I would have given another start or 2 had the waitress been more apologetic or a manager had come to apologize. But I guess customer service is not that important.  I hope it improves.
