My partner and I whom have neither had very much experience with Indian food to begin with, took a recommendation from work colleagues to go to Tandoori Times and we both agreed it was one of the best decisions we'd made about dining in a long time. While not extremely simple to find, this hidden gem in Scottsdale is worth the time to seek out. Their menu is very easily broken down into main ingredient such as chicken, seafood, lamb, etc... I had the Goa Prawns and they were delicious. The shrimp themselves were generically good but the sauce they were in was fantastic. Spicy but not too spicy, flavorful but not too flavorful, and excellently paired with some rice and the awesome and highly recommended garlic naan. My partner had the coconut chicken curry and garlic and onion naan, which I had bites of and both were very very yummy. Friday night they have a belly dancer which added a fun and unique element to the dining experience. I would highly recommend trying this place out for either lunch or dinner. I know I will be paying them many many more visits to come.
