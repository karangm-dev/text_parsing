I had the displeasure of attending a wedding reception at Our Lady of The Cedars and it was a huge disappointment.  The cook was an obnoxious, loud, rude jerk who treated people like garbage.  He yelled at staff in front of the guests, called the bride a sexist profainty to her face, was awful to the bartenders, DJ and cake baker.  On top of that his food was awful.  The man felt compelled to coat everything in paprika because he is a lazy horrible cook.  I do not in any way recomend this facility, what a joke.
