Great service very accommodating not put off by half naked women in the European section. The cabanas were great, complete with your a television and musters just outside to cool off those sunbathing on the lounges. The food was ok, as to be expected for lunch service at a hotel. The decor was tasteful. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there.
