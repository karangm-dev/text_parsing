This is the worst airline I've ever flown with. Was flying out of Vegas to Bellingham. Waited in line for an hour just to be told my flight was cancelled till the next night at 9:30pm. Thank goodness I was early enough to get on a flight later that night. Crazy lines, way over priced baggage prices... Pay for carry ons?! I then received a voucher for the inconvenience... Which I didn't end up using because no one in the whole airport could tell me how, where or when I could use this voucher.
