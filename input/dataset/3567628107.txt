So I chose this place because they were open at the time I wanted to go pick up dinner at 4pm.  Ordered a Papaya salad and Pad Thai. They asked how I wanted it Mild Medium or Hot.  I stayed safe and said mild for both.  Well, when I got home and opened up the containers--of which they stupidly put them in one bag-dumb because papaya salad is always cold- I had to remove it in the car before heading home.  The Papaya salad was not evenly cut...their shredder is not working and it is supposed to be picked up like speghetti...this was clumps of papaya shredded half way. ALL I COULD TASTE WAS ONION. ONION...like eating a clumpy mouthful of ONION.  Horrid.  The Pad Thai had dry pieces of chicken and ZERO seasoning.  AWFUL. CRAP.  Waste of $17. NEVER BE BACK. They cannot produce Thai food that is worthy.  Instead of driving back to the place to return this...I'm writing this review. STAY AWAY.  Should have gone to Thai Plates or tried another place..these guys were the only ones open at the time I wanted food.  BAD DECISION. STAY AWAY. Headed to the fridge to eat crackers and cheese. TICKED.
