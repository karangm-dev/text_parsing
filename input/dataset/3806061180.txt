I found Dr. Waltz through my girlfriend and couldn't be happier about it.  I have had many different chiropractors and none of them have been able to match Dr. Waltz skills and acumen let alone his amazing ability to relate to and interact with his patients.  He has a very friendly personality and will make you feel comfortable and at-ease from the minute you meet him.  Best adjustment I have ever had and I highly recommend his services.
