Miller's handled the work needed for our insurance claim very efficiently and professionally.  We had very significant water damage on a manufactured house.  They communicated promptly both with me and with the insurance company, and with subcontractors.  The subcontractors they referred me to were also very good communicators, and efficient about their work.  All very nice people.  Everyone on their team was available and forthcoming with answers to all my questions.  I would recommend them and I would solicit their services again!
