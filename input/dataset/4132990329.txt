I have been to many bbq restaurant. I liked this restaurant because I had good time with my friends before. But things get worse, my friend found 2 pieces of hair from  beef brisket. Fisrt time she did not care. But there was srcond long hair form the meet. I was upset and talked to one korean waitress. She did not explain and apologize . She walked away with caring hairs. I really feel that i was wrong to like lee bbq. Lee doesnt care customer service. They dont give shit on hair on thr meet. I strongly recommend NOT to come to LEE. They may havr extra hair or what ever on meet that sever u !
