I can't remember when I had a lunch as good as today's ....wait.....the last time was when I was here last ....about 9 months ago. This place ROCKS!! Ravi is awesome. I used to pick up lunch here weekly then sadly moved jobs and I  wasn't around the corner any longer.  If your lucky enough to be in the neighbourhood - do not turn down the opportunity to stop in and grab a bite to eat. There are always daily specials and the menu is posted on the large blackboard as you walk in. There are only 4 or 5 types of wraps and they are all great !  If you get here just before noon you beat the rush, even if you get caught in the line - it's well worth the wait.  Every single item on the menu is terrific !  Today I brought a friend here for a quick lunch and we both had the combo of corn & crab soup and the lamb wrap !! ..........WOW was it fantastic !   The combo is a prefect lunch. The restaurant is small and seats about 16 at a very large communal table and there are about 4 additional tables in the back space, or if you prefer to sit facing the street, you could be lucky to grab a spot at the window.  In the spring, summer and early fall the patio is open and it is a lovely space to have lunch. Thanks Ravi - you and your team do a great job and I hope to return soon.
