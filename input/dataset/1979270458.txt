Read the reviews so decided to give it a shot and boy was I glad I did ! The food was absolutely amazing and  fresh  the service was great as well the cashier was super nice and   explained the menu to Me giving Me  me lots of options and letting Me substitute sides. Only downside is there isn't enough seating and I wasn't a fan of eating on the Styrofoam containers  but the quality of the food will make you look past that. Wish they had a full restaurant with bar  if so I could see myself eating here a few times a week.
