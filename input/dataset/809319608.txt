Here's a recent update:  Having returned because of a very nice manager, we were unhappily surprised by changes.  To wit:  They have now put on the tables those electronic things where you order your food (yes, I know they have them at Applebee's, and that's why we never eat there).  You use them order your appetizers, drinks and desserts.  The only thing you order from the server is your entree.  When our server showed up - after a really long time - she told us she was late because she was tired from having worked a double shift the day before.  I don't care.  Your job is to be on time, not making customers wait.  Then when I questioned her about the little kiosk, she told us everyone has them now (no, they don't) and also told us she didn't have to worry about her job because she was 'irreplaceable.'  Really?  The cemetery is full of irreplaceable people.  After we ordered, we never saw her again.  (The food was brought out by an expediter).  She never even refilled our drinks, or came over to see if the shake we ordered was any good.So here's the bottom line:  Order appetizer from kiosk.  Order drinks (non-alcoholic) from kiosk.  Order entree from server.  Order dessert from kiosk.  Pay with a credit card at kiosk.  Practically self-service now.  Since the server is doing 1/4 of the work (3/4 being done by machine) does she deserve a full tip?  No.  Only 1/4 work deserves 1/4 tip.  If I want self-service, I'll get fast food.
