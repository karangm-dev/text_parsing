April 16th is National Eggs Benedict day so guess what I had today? No not a brizza, I ordered Eggs Benedict, with crispy hash browns , no Canadian bacon,  with a side of crispy bacon, and a crispy muffin. I told the staff,  I wanted my yolks soft, runny. I said, "they always make the eggs hard" Eggs Benedict are supposed to be runny. My muffin was bareky toasted, I cut into the first egg, it was okay, not great. I cut into the second egg, not a runny yolk in sight. I took it back, personally, with a piece of bacon and crispy hash browns on my plate. 10 minutes later I got an uncooked English muffin after asking for a crispy muffin again, with a perfect Eggs Benedict. My hash browns disappeared off the plate they were missing. I hardly ever take myself out to breakfast but Eggs Benedict are my favorite and National Eggs Benedict day is something I do not intend to miss. But next time I'll be going elsewhere
