The machines are really tight.  The card tables, lets say they open and close the  tables as new decks are in favor of the house.  They also use multiple decks which is favor of the house as well.  They do not track your money appropriately and the pit bosses could care less how much you spend it will not go on your card.  I just got my statement and it was so wrong it was not even funny.  My liability is up for a jackpot I won at Harrah's because these casinos never track your properly.   I REFUSE TO GO THERE SPENDING MONEY SO THEY CAN CONTINUOUSLY BUILD NEW HOTELS AND CASINOS AT ALL THREE OF THEIR LOCATIONS!
