At least the Pinks concession stand by Section 3.  Unqualified servers who don't tell you that they won't take cash - and they seriously won't take cash.  Then the manager wouldn't even take the cash to another register. The lines are stupid long and the workers incapable of handling the slightest issue. I m sitting upstairs if there is a next time I come to a Knights game.
