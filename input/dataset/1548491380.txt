We used Riteway of Calgary to move to BC.  Their website says they estimate 15-20% high and we did discuss this when the estimater was there.  However we did get a shock when the final bill came in 33% higher than the estimate.  If the estimate was supposed to be 20% high then the estimate was out by 50%.  The guys who did the actually moving were great so Allied Van lines would be okay; just don't use Riteway as the agent.  Moving is stressful enough without expensive surprises.
