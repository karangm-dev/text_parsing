The place is not tidy and clean. After our server took our order, he sat down and started eating his meal a couple of tables over, and never came back to check on us. We had to flag down the next waiter to bring us additional napkins. Since we sat at the table right in front of the cashier, we asked her politely for 3 glasses of water, and she said yes. Then, went got her food and sat down and started to eat. It is very unprofessional of the wait staff to complain about the retired white couple that sat in a booth across from us. I can hear the waiter complaining in cantonese that the white demons are hard to take care off. If you want better service, avoid this place. I have nothing to praise other than the duck.
