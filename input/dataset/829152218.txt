Do not fly Allegiant.  Supposed to fly Punta Gorda to Cedar Rapids 1/17/2014.  Clear weather both airports.  Flight cancelled 2 hours before take-off and rescheduled for 18 hours later.  No reason for the delay.  Likely no crew and/or equipment.  Looks like I will miss my Aunt's funeral.  Looks like my last flight on Allegiant.Cost of ticket with extras 130 dollarsWater provided noneCost of missing my Aunt's funeral and never flying Allegiant again....priceless.
