What a fun spot for brunch! Not only was the food delicious but the service was excellent. I felt very taken care of at Jewels. The menu is super eclectic as well - not sure where else one could get a delicious waffle sandwich. I got the veggie omelette made with egg whites and cooked with no butter and oil (thank you! I love restaurants that are happy to accommodate when I'm trying to watch my calories). The side of potatoes was sooo good and crispy too! My boyfriend got the breakfast waffle sandwich. I had a few bites and It was amazing. I can't believe that was a gluten free waffle because it tasted sooo good and it was so fluffy and really soaked up the syrup. We shared a cold brew and my boyfriend finished off his meal with the peanut butter dream brownie. Nothing short of delicious. Service was fast as well.
