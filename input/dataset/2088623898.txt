The very fact reviews vary between good and terrible speaks to the inconsistency and we believe the ultimate undoing of this restaurant.Walked in and seated promptly. The menu looked incredible. That's it. Fell apart from there,1) the service is horrendous. Our waitress and all others were unsmiling sourpusses who moved glacially. Had the restaurant been busy, then the wait to see a waitress and the wait for food would have been understandable especially if the food is great. They were not that busy. Call me quirky but I like a smiling pleasant waitress.2) the poor service was not for want of staff. They were all chronically aggregated at the side doing nothing and when the food came out,  no one was sure where it should go.There was no expediter. Compared to restaurants like Butterfields which always has a line to get in, this was pure amateurish and clearly without a manager. There was a very young lady in the front that was pitifully unknowledgeable. 3) worst coffee I have had in years. They claim it is premium stuff. It was bitter and overly strong suggesting machine not cleaned and proportions wrong4)never got to the food because watching this whole thing was painful and very slowSpoke with someone that claimed to be the mother of the owner and she may have been the cook. She blew us offToo many other options out there. A shame as menu appeared very promising
