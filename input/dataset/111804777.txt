The store itself looked clean and organized but the clothing was so crammed on the racks that it was hard to pull out one item to look at without also pulling out the clothing next to it.  That makes for an unpleasant shopping experience. It takes a tremendous amount of work to actually see what's on the racks. Additionally, they have a Free People rack with about a dozen items.  The two items on that rack that were my daughter's size had big rips/holes--obvious, not hidden. These items were priced $25+ (I think one was $34?).  It looks like they need to cull their stock by marking down about 1/3 of it to such low prices that people will take it of their hands and free up space on their racks.
