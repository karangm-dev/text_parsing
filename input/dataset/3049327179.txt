I do not recommend this place especially for women. I was there today to find out why my laptop was not working after they had done work on it. "Kurt" or Kirk" whatever his name was, greeted us but his demeanor changed when I said, professionally, the laptop still was not working. He got arrogant and repeatedly asked me what I did wrong with it - making assumptions. Personally, I don't think he likes women. Women: Stay away.
