My wedding party picked their tuxes up here, they were measured in AZ, GA, and FL and all at different stores.  Somehow, with 7 different tuxes, not a single tux came in sized correctly.  This store was able to resolve the problem but they were rude about it.  Additionally, my husband lost his phone in the store.  We called three times and also stopped in when we returned the tuxes and they told us they did not have it and that they had scoured the store.  As soon as we returned to Arizona they called to say they found our phone but refused to mail it because they did not want to be responsible for it.  My entire wedding party swears they will never use Men's Wearhouse for anything ever again.
