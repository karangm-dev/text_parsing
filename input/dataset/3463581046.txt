I wish I was "wasted away again in Margaritaville"... Not that I was wasted after going here, but it sure would've been easy to get there! The margaritas are so good, they go down so smooth -- if you don't watch how much you drink, next thing you know, BAM! you're wasted in Margaritaville. I didn't really eat anything besides the chips, guac, and salsa, but those were phenomenal! The menu looked extremely appetizing, and I'll be back to try some of the items on their menu. The atmosphere and ambiance is great too! The setup is very chic, modern, and inviting -- like a place to just hang out and enjoy the company of the ones you're there with. Great little spot!
