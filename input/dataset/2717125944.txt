This review is for Jose who works in the cosmetic department. I saw Jose after he was recommended by the department manager. After a failed attempt at bridal make up at a different salon I was a little nervous. I had my trial and was so happy with the result!! I couldn't of asked for a better make up artist or a more passionate person who knows his products. I came In Thinking I'd only purchase bridal related make up but bought new skin care products which I love!! The following week Jose did my makeup for my wedding day and he was just as spectacular as the first time! Go see him if you need an updated look or if you are in need of a fabulous make up artist!!
