Per my lease agreement on my rental home, I needed to have the carpets professionally cleaned before moving out. Desperate & running out of time with less than a week left I used my Yelp app to look for a local company with good reviews. Carpet MD had all 5 stars reviews and after using their services I agree they've earned every one and more! Steve was quick to return my call,  had my appointment set up within a few days, quoted me a reasonable rate and stuck to it! He called 10-15 minutes before his arrival in which I told him, "perfect I have time to hit the corner store for a soda" he said we are stopping by one on the way I'll get it for you!? Really, yes really and he did! *BONUS POINTS*  Steve and his coworker were quick to get to cleaning, setting up wall guards to protect the corners and moving at lightning speed! I was amazed, 4 bedrooms and the hall were done in less than 2 hours. Believe me they needed a thorough cleaning, they did that and more. All of the carpets came out cleaner than before I moved in. I'll definitely call them again! Good rates, professional, and they did an amazing job, this is one MD you'll want to make house calls!
