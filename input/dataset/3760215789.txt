A lot of what people wrote about the Sport Center is pretty much on point.  It is a good size complex with a large indoor basketball court, a climbing wall, an indoor play area, large spaces for events and outdoor batting cages.  However, it's sad to say that this place needs a lot of TLC.   I came here with my nephew for the batting cages because it is outdoors and according to the website, it was supposed to be a "state of the art outdoor batting cage park".  Well out of the 10 cages they had, almost half was out of order.  The balls were horrible, some of it missing chunks.  It's great how your view from the cage looks out into a field as if you're in a ballpark, but like I said previously, there is a lot of maintenance that this place, especially the batting cage area, could use.  I don't think there was any part about it that was state of the art.It's a bit sad because the place has a lot of potential and there doesn't seem to be many outdoor cages in Las Vegas, since I really haven't found any other yet.  The staff was very nice and though it wasn't ran in the best or most professional manner, I truly hope that somehow this place get's some type of funding to get a makeover and become a truly fun sports complex for the community.  I could be wrong, maybe they get lots of events here, but from the looks of it, I think it's probably had better days when it first opened its doors.
