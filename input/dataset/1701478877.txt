We stayed at the springhills over the weekend. Overall the rooms were nice and pool is a rooftop pool which was really cool. You are like few blocks away from the worlds largest sportbook. Every employee I ran into was very nice and represented the hotel, city and marriott very nicely. If you don't want to stay on the strip I would recommend staying here.Room Tip: Good view of the strip if you room is like odd number.. Ect 1821
