JJ's caught me by surprise and I couldn't be more excited.  If you haven't visited, you need to make it a point to check out this new hotspot.Let me first start out by saying I have always been a little bias on my hotdog cravings.  For the past decade, I've loved Chicago dogs moreso than the Carolina style.  I did grow up in Statesville in the 80s and there was a place called Elliott's Old Fashioned Ice Cream and their ice cream and hot dogs were insanely great and memorable.  It was a classic soda shop feel and was very 50's.  It since closed after the owners passed away and I've been disappointed 95% of the Carolina dogs that I've had.  Enter, JJ's.My wife got the Char Heel and Homemade Chips w/ Ranch.  I got the Chicago Dog with Onion Rings.  I ended with a Chocolate Shake and she had a nice import beer as their selection is great for this type of spot.My Chicago Dog was fantastic and I have to say they have the edge in flavor over Matt's Chicago Dog.  That floored me.  The relish isn't the noteable bright green buy the flavor was fantastic.  Now, the Char Heel.  This is the best Carolina-Style hotdog that I have had since 1995ish.  As soon as I took a bite of this magnificent hotdog and it had that perfect snap, the flavors of the onions, chili and mustard sent me back.  Yep, I'm a little intense with this one but it's just that good.  The flavor was perfectly balanced and it brought me back to my youth.  This is located next to Lebowski's and the businesses that tend to go in here don't last long.  They have a great parking lot now and a rooftop patio so I'm hoping people take advantage of this place.  I know I'll be doing my part in hope they stay strong.
