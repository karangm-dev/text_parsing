Franchise by Chinese people. How much of a coincidence is that!? I know my race too well I think.Yes they r busy becuz it's a Quiznos only. My sandwich is not even warm after it came out from the toaster.Ordered a mesquite chicken, I can count how many pieces becuz it's so little. Alot of condiments, condiments r cheap oh pls.Is it me or is it just this Quiznos? I've been to other which I have experienced much better. I was jus craving for a sub and stumbled upon this place. Dedicated to higher quality? Hmmm....think again!
