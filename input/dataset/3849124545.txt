Excellent meal from start to finish. The coconut mojito and orange margarita were great. Enjoyed the appetizer platter, entr√©e, and dessert which were all flavorful and delicious!  Also the guacamole is made fresh to order at the ceviche bar.  I would highly recommend this restaurant if your in the mood for Latin food / Mexican
