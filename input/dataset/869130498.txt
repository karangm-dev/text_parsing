I wish this place was around when I lived in Tempe.The food is spectacular. We had a total of 4 in a group, we all ordered different items and we all are raving about this place.I had the bacon and egg burrito, and it was the best I have ever had. The crepe, the salsa and the sauce absolutely heavenly.We also tried the strawberry and creme crepe - deelish. The crepe with ham and cheese - deelish! The place is small and the decor minimal, but who cares when the food is that good.The staff - really nice and helpful. They even brought out some new desserts for us to test for free.It may take a little longer than you think it should to get your food...but I am telling you it is because they are working magic in the kitchen to get you their deeeelish crepes!GO!!!! EAT!!!!! ENJOY!!!!!
