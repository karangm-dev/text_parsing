I wanted to ensure we went with a local company for my home warranty and unfortunately we chose this company. The customer service is horrific they don't care about the customer and Kevin the guy I was working with would not help me with the issue that was covered by the warranty. I kept telling him, it doesn't seem like you want to help me. He said I would have to get him documentation of other services performed by a professional prior to them fixing the issue. The company they used to come to try and fix my dishwasher (that was leaking) was horrible to. Both companies kept blaming each other.  I would have assumed to have it fixed in possibly a week maybe two. It took over 3 months of fighting with them for them to say they weren't going to help. I have been paying two years for the warranty and didn't have one issue.  Bottom line is it still didn't get fixed and they didn't care. I am canceling my policy and going with another company.
