I too bought the 3 Microdermabrasion Groupon...I give it 1 star because the staff are friendly enough- Though I have to agree that the tech who does the treatment gives way more dirty laundry about her boss than anyone should hear...I don't mind chit chat but she really bashes the Drs who own the place ...As for the treatment- it was ok- but not great and they do try to get you to buy extra treatments for your face...I paid an extra $50 to have a spot removed and it didn't work...when I came on my 3rd visit I paid another $25 and she said sometimes it takes several treatments...that information to me sounds like a scam...overpricing items and telling people they may have to do it numerous times is wrong...I wouldn't recommend it- I also think it's tacky for a Drs office to ask for tips!! Are you kidding??! Your stuff is already overpriced and it's weird to ask! I gave a small tip because I thought it was strange they ask but they even post a sign asking for them!! The Dr does face lifts...Microdermabrasion isn't even his thing and it's clear he doesn't put money into that so I'm not sure I even understand why they have the groupon! I had already purchased the 3 so I wanted to finish them.
