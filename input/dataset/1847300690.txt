We have been coming to Battista's during every trip to Vegas since we accidentally stumbled upon this place. We took a chance our first trip and waited the 20 minutes to be sat and we are so glad we did. We always make a reservation now but this place is worth waiting if you need to. We LOVE the older gentleman that comes around to play music and every single bite is delicious!! The atmosphere is authentic and their walls are covered in things to look at! The ladies who run the front could be a little more pleasant to those who come in with no reservation (or just in general, since they also couldn't seem to be bothered to answer where the restroom was) however, even their attitudes doesn't make this place worth any less than 5 stars. A hole in the wall but a treasure!!
