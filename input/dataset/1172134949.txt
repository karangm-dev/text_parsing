I am reviewing this place solely in the category of buffets. As far as buffets go, the Bellagio is the best. I've been to a lot of buffets both in Las Vegas and other states. I am rather fond of buffets as I'm a big eater. The food choice is excellent and some of the food is great even as a stand alone dish. I agree with some of the other reviews that there has been somewhat of a decline over the last 10 years, but again as far as buffets go, it's still the best. I've tried the Wynn, Bacchanal at Caesar's and pretty much every other buffet on and off the strip and the quality/taste of the Bellagio buffet is still the best. The Bacchanal has Bellagio beat as far as the sheer number of choices and the Wynn is comparable, but I still give the nod to the Bellagio. I'm actually not a big fan of the crab legs, but I found that the taste/quality of crab legs are pretty much the same at all the top $ buffets. Bacchanal's crab legs were the mostly frozen, although the quality was fine, with the Bellagio and the Wynn pretty much the identical. I enjoyed the meat station at the Bellagio the best with Bacchanal meat station having the most choices, but lacking the quality. If I had to rate the Bellagio compared to other stand-alone restaurants, obviously it would not be 5 stars, but I think it's only fair to keep restaurants in categories. The price is around $40.00 so it's expensive for a buffet but not unreasonable compared to other high-end buffets and certainly not that expensive compared to other restaurants, where you could easily spend that much per person at the Cheesecake factory with apps, entrees and desserts.
