Glad I didn't pay!! I did look at the reviews before going and they were border line so I decided to try this myself...those that gave 5 stars must not have experianced true authentic enchiladas! The posted menu was super confusing, when I finally got the hang of it I ordered a green chicken enchilada and a short rib enchilada. I added my sauces, some toppings, sat down. Not very much space in the resturant. The decor is okay, although I'm the type of person who would sit on the floor and look at blank walls if the food was outstanding...this was not! CUMIN does not equal Mexican. Both the sauces I got on my enchilads were overly spiced with cumin aswell as the both meats so it was CUMIN overload...I was no impressed to say the least. I would not be going back to this place, not even if invited and it was free!
