I don't give too many onesies and twosies, but I believe this place merits it on one main level that trumps the modern high ceilings, giant photos of good looking sushi and the staff who get something for effort. The real issue here on two specific occasions is this; I was attracted by all the ads and photos of their somewhat new Temari offering. It stands for "hand ball" or the like and are rice balls either stuffed, mixed or topped with various ingredient combinations. In sum it adds up to this; too expensive for the lack of quality ingredients in the 4 balls themselves. The photos are quite misleading and in the case of the crispy lobster balls is virtually faux...where's the beef comes to mind...pretty much lobster rillettes at best. I think you can read between my overt lines that I was really disappointed times two.
