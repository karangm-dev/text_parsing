Strong 2.5 vs 2 star.What I like about this place is the convenience factor for me. It is literally right up the street from me. And for what you pay, you get a decent amount. I have gotten a two meat plate combo which runs $14.00 before tax. For this choice, you can choice two meats from either brisket, ribs, chicken, sausage. You also get two sides and can choose from potato salad, pinto beans, baked beans, mac and cheese, cole slaw, or rice.I actually enjoyed their ribs. I am no BBQ connoisseur but I like what I like. The first time they were definitely more tender than the second time i ate there. And the second time the seasoning tasted different. Like they put ole bay seasoning on it, which I am not opposed to, just kind of took me a minute to adjust my expectations.The brisket was alright the first time. It wasn't overwhelmed with the flavor of smoke and you could see the smoke ring and was pretty tender. The second time, it was just off for me. Definitely not tender and just off. I don't have a specific reason.The sides here for me are a major fail. The baked beans are straight out of can. The cole slaw was bland. The potato salad is essentially potatoes and mayo only. The mac and cheese was cheesy but too soft and bland. They offer you BBQ sauce on the side (which is good, nothing great) and onions and pickles. I agree with another yelper and it would be nice if they gave you bread on the side. Would I come back is the question. And the answer is yes. I guess I am a glutton for punishment. I really believe they have a good starting base and can be much better.They have changed their hours and are now open from 5:30am - 5pm close. They open early to serve breakfast and maybe I will check that out next time.
