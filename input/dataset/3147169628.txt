A previous garage door company, failed to show up. I found A Authentic in the Foothills Focus. I called and asked them if they installed equipment purchased elsewhere, and they said they did. They were a little higher priced, but at this point, I wanted the thing installed.It was Saturday morning. The woman said someone would be out between 10a and 11a. At 9:30a, Geoffrey arrived. He couldn't have been nicer. Walked through all the steps. Took the old opener down. Installed the new one. Programmed the remotes and we were up and running in less than 90-minutes.Great customer service and they did what they promised.
