I had high expectations when coming here but the experience just sucked....first off this place is sooooo tiny, probably a max of 16 people with only 1 server that took forever to serve us when there was only 3 other tablesIt's a cute environment none of the lessI found the food to be quite pricy for what it's worth like perogies were $10 and they were nothing spectacular, then the waitress recommended a off the menu app which was sausages and saucerkraut, that cost $21 for 3 sausages, seriously.....there was a cheese infused one, pork and I think beef, nothing special, taste like the frozen ones I get at the supermarket.....Now with the schnitzel, there were I believe 7 different types, there was 5 of us so we ordered different ones to see how they taste, first off the schnitzels r hugeeeeeee, almost covered the entire plate....in terms of the toppings they have, not impressed at all, egg and fish on a schnitzel do not mix at allllllll....the schnitzel was nothing special, good but not great and wasn't a experience that I expected....our meal of 5 schnitzel, 2 perogies, sausages was about $150......Never again.....
