Wanted to stop somewhere for a quick bite before a show last night.  First choice had a huge line waiting to get in (place just opened), so I continued down the strip and ended up at 800 Degrees.Really cool concept, you walk in, and there's a guy working the pizza dough (all pies are same size, 12").  When he's finished, your dough moves to the next station: sauce, cheese, the basics.  Then if you'd like to add any more ingredients you can for $1.50 each.  I chose the basic Margherita pizza, reasonably priced @ under $8.  Move down the line, pay for your order, and your pie goes into the 800+ degree oven.  It's cooked in a couple minutes, and your ready to eat.At first I was kinda disappointed when I picked up the first slice and all the toppings slid off.  However, upon further investigation (there's a brochure right by the entrance), I learned that you're supposed to eat this type of pie with a knife & fork, I guess that's "Neopolitan" style.   Once I armed myself with the proper utensils, it was a much better experience.  The pizza was a little soggier than I would like, but it did have a nice flavor, the crust was great.  It did get cold a bit quicker than expected, however.  My last couple slices were at room temperature by the time I finished.Overall, I'd say this place is a decent value, especially for a strip eatery.  Definitely better than a Sbarro, or other franchise place. However, as a LV local, I'll probably stick to my neighborhood joints in the future.
