Very disappointed. I went in last week and noticed that the blender right next to the cashier was dirty and had dust on top. The floors and carpets were not cleaned. I've been coming here for about 8 months and every time I go in I notice the lack of customer service, but most importantly sanitation and the employees not being clean after each use of blenders and not changing/cleaning down the tables properly. I've been in the food and beverage industry for three years and I know how the protocols inside a kitchen work. This is defiantly not something that the health inspector in Arizona would approve of.
