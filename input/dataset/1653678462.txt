I came in withy the intention of purchasing a 60 Inch tv. The one I was looking at was $1500. I had a few question on comparable tv's and was willingto possibly go up in price a little more. I literally stood in front of the TV and wandered around the TV dept for at least 10 minutes. Now it's my day off and I'm not dressed all fancy but the male customer who walked in after me sure received attention super quick, not to mention the 3 male associates that walked by me or I walked by did not even acknowledge me. You lost my $1500 sale today as I ended up walking out and will most definitely will not be coming back.
