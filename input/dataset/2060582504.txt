We have had trouble recently with our ac unit running but not cooling the house. Rudy's came out and quickly and efficiently found the problem. It was an easy fix that someone could have easily overlooked but Charles, our technician, took the time to really try and find the problem, not just put a bandaid on it! He was incredibly friendly and informative. I also really liked always talking to the same people on the phone and feeling like our business meant something to them. Great customer service goes a long way and Rudys did not disappoint.
