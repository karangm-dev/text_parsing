One of the crappier Marriotts I've ever stayed at. The staff is nice and professional enough. But the fact that it's right by the frontage road along I-17, you tend to attract a seedier crowd. Also, with three floors worth of rooms here, guess how many washer/dryer they have for everyone? ONE crappy washer and ONE crappy dryer! Don't even think about washing your clothes on a Friday night. For a two hour period, I went to see if the washer was finally available, each time I was met with yet another load of dirty clothes inside. If they can't afford to get more machines, consider installing one of those number ticket dispensers! Just a thought. Maybe I would have a better shot of washing my clothes. I also considered sitting on top of the washer until the load was done, but that would be kind of creepy on my part. I will be packing all my dirty clothes with me and never come back here again.
