This one is a very good shop! Of like 4-5, that I've tried. Fast service, friendly guys. I like the way they make my Fav, Ham and provolone with everything and their sweet cherry peppers..I actually also tried (off the menu) the Capicola and provolone same way! Very clean place. Great atmosphere too. Keep up the good work, love your ingredients with deli thin slices.
