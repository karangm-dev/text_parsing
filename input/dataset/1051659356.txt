There are times when the Asian in me screams "satisfy my taro boboa craving!!!" and I have to obey, jump in the car and start driving!  So here I am my eyes round, my tummy saying thank you, happily sipping on my taro. And munching on some fried fish balls. It almost makes me feel like I'm somewhere Asia except for the fact that after I walked in, about ten gringos walked in behind me. Service appears to be quick as everyone was quickly served. In the span of sitting here and writing this review I would say 15 people have been served quickly. Which is good cause if everyone had came in the same state that I was in, if service was slow there might have been massive boboa craving crumpiness. And I must remark pricing is reasonable. Which is always a bonus!Thanks Yelp for having mobile review. Craving satisfied, review written, I'm happily on my way out to my next venture!
