A random taco place in Montreal. This review is specifically for the tacos and burritos. The food here is practical and cheap, sure, but it's also mediocre. A place like this wouldn't last a day in Mexico because they take forever to serve you and also the food is honestly whatever and so is the service.  I mean look at that rice, it's damn white rice at a Mexican restaurant. No flavor. Come here if you have no standards and are very hungry for a cheap meal.
