This place has gone down hill.  Clearly they have cut back on staff and food qualityMany of the reviews were written before the menu changed.  I've been going for years and the food quality has gone down hill.The service is slow & my salad, which was $15, was as bad as it gets.It's just not worth spending the money on this place when there are so many other options.
