I tried something other than the tacos!! I finally did it! Pacos has never let me down; I can always rely on this place to be a consistent win for dinner. The lady and I walked in at around 7pm and they told us it would be about a 15 minute wait. ...orrr we could just take a seat at the bar, or one of the barside 2 tops with full service. Yea, we'll go with that.We were immediately given plates, chips and salsas, and had our drink order taken (Their margaritas are the bomb, make sure to ask for their daily special, ours were the No Name for $5). After multiple visits getting their wonderful tacos, I ventured to order the Fiesta Bowl, which was basically a 'skinny' burrito with cabbage instead of lettuce (which was really great!).I don't think I've reviewed here before, so please don't get me wrong, the tacos are AWESOME. But it felt good to try something new. ... And now I can say I've done it and I don't have to do it again and I can back to tacos thankyouverymuch.Always good service.Always good food.Always leftovers.How can you go wrong?
