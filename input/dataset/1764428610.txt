One of the best United clubs I've been to in the US. While it is smaller than the rest (Newark, Houston, SAN Fran, etc.), it is fully stocked and very clean. Ambiance is welcoming and comforting. All the staff are kind and generous. No rushing people around like at Newark. I actually felt like an elite member of a club, as opposed to the clubs at the United hubs, since those are flocked with randoms.
