Do Not Ever Rent here. They have a special category for fetching money out of you as Moveout Charges- That Category is "Indian Food Smell"- Keep minimum 600 USD only for this after moveout. Dont bother to get your duct cleaned from other pro services as they decline the same saying the cleaning was not as per Palisades Standard. And their Account Resolution Team is the worst department in the world to deal with so BEWARE of them. Good Advice is DO NOT EVER RENT IN PALISADES
