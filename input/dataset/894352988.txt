What a treasure! Every time I go there, it takes me back to the old days. I love that not much changes at Beef & Bottle. The food is ALWAYS good, the drinks are ample and the ambiance is great. Part of that ambiance is the darkly lit booths but I think the lighting needs a little improving (it's hard to read the menu in the dark) but the wait staff was eager to explain specials, so that's easy to overlook. I LOVE Beef and Bottle! I sometimes forget about it but every time I return I can't wait to go back again and again!
