I have gone to Dr. Berelowitz since I was 12 years old (I am now 28!). He did move away for a few years, but I was SO happy when he came back to town. He cares about his patients and is very thorough. I know the wait-list is long for him, but that jsut shows how amazing he is. I have had a few endocrinologists since I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes 26 years ago, and he is by far the best endo and doctor I have ever had.
