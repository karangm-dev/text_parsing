On Saturday October 17 I came into to Wal-Mart on Lake Mead and Rancho this is the most horrible experience I've in counters in years I've stand in line for over 25 minutes at there money center having two mangers bye the names of Peggy and Leocada come over and Remove the cashier from the register while at least 10 customers were in line and had an attitude when I ask for the clerk to be returned. Get it together Wal-Mart and get rid of those nasty employee you have on your payroll.
