We had a great experience trading in 2 minis for a new Countryman.  This is the best car buying experience you will ever have. Naomi and Cody are very knowledgeable and made sure our factory order Mini has perfect. Even if you buy a BMW or Merc you will not get the friendly family like feeling you get at this dealership.  Their service department is first rate so no need to worry about that.   If you want a mini this is the place you want to buy it
