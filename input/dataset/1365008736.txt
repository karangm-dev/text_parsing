Something in our order was wrong and I told the waitress and she got super defensive saying that she confirmed with us and we said it was okay. Though that's not how we remembered events going down, she still argued she was right. She was so rude that I was in shock. She continued to be rude and short the rest of the meal. The food came out quick but there was truly nothing special about it. There was no salt so there was absolutely no taste. I visit Vegas from LA often and am always eating at new places, but I will definitely not return here or recommend it to anyone I know in Vegas.
