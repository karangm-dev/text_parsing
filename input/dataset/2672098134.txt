Pro's-Service was good. A couple of the salsa's were good. Prices not too bad.The soup with the noodle sticks was very good.Con'sAll of the food  besides the soup was bland. All of the proteins were dry and overcooked. Chicken, Pork, Carne Asada all overcooked and bland. Everything on the fajita serving platter had a burnt taste after about 5 minutes. Evident that many of the items were not made in house. If your by the airport try El Fresco's Cocina Mexicana. The best Mexican food I have ever tried.
