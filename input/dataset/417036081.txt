Pizzeria Bianco perfect name for boring, bland and colorless! Don't get me wrong the color white is an elegant color, however pizzeria Bianco wasn't reflecting it when we experienced it!  Pizza was ok not what we expected, being born and raised in Chicago and frequent visitors to NY maybe tainted our experience because pizza in those cities is amazing not to mention Florence Italy too.  We tried 2 pizzas wise guy and the white pizza BiancoVerde.  But ok maybe we remember it's Phoenix.   Maybe it would have tasted better had our server whose service was equivalent to the personality of a soap dish, very dry and added nothing to the experience of Phoenix big town, small town charm to the meal.  We thought a robot could have done a better job.  His partners in the service made it bearable but we left saying," never again". There are other options in the valley that make a pie that is good even delicious, with service reflecting the charm of Phoenix.
