I've done business with Audio Advice for 30 years now, first in Raleigh and now here in Charlotte.  Their team is the best I've seen in Audio, Video and Automation.  In fact, I'd rate my experience with them as among the best in any industry.  Leon Shaw and his team not only carry and sell the best gear in the industry but they live and breathe this stuff personally.  Everyone working at Audio Advice is passionate about their own experience with audio, video and home automation.  I've worked with different folks over the years.  Mostly Leon and Ivan up in Raleigh.  Mostly Dustin and Robert here in Charlotte.  I recommend all of them highly.  All are very honest and direct and can be relied upon to give the very best advice.  When they discuss something as simple as a component or as complex as a whole house system, they bring their own experience into the equation and they approach each solution with a longer term approach in mind (rather than making a quick sale).  This is why I've been and remain a lifelong customer and why I feel good referring my friends and family to them.
