I heard about this place and HAD to give it a try because I hadn't had bubble tea in years!! This place did NOT disappoint! The cafe is clean and inviting. The decor makes you want to come and stay a while. A few people were studying and a couple of guys were playing jenga! It's like a hang out spot with great menu options!! I ordered the mango bubble tea and was WOWED!! It was so good that my husband and son both loved it too! I will definitely be going back for a great bubble tea and have plans to bring a friend so we can hang out for a bit.
