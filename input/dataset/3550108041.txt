I got in touch with Ryan Lanoue over internet and asked for a OTD price on a 2016 prius eco. He immediately responded with the final OTD.I'm convinced the OTD i've received is fair and good price to work with. I've browsed other dealers websites for colors and i found that right toyota has more inventory and color options than anyone in phoenix area. I zeroed in couple of colors.Before setting the appointment to visit the dealer, i've  asked ryan to bring the price down, thinking that it may take few more e-mails.Just with one e-mail he agreed to the price.The process at the dealer was quick and great experience. Ryan took me to his office, went through few papers, showed the car and i'm out of dealership within 45min.Long story short, Ryan handled it professionally, Honoured OTD, put me through a very efficient and quick process in buying the car.I found Ryan is honest, easy to work with and most importantly he delivered on his words and very  result oriented.I'm also happy that right toyota has gave me a free package because it pre build with car at this dealership, where i found online other dealers are charging extra.Overall awesome experience from start to finish, i would highly recommend Ryan and Right Toyota.
