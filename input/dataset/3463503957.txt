Dismal service.  They messed up my order by not putting any espresso in my double espresso order.Everyone makes mistakes- that's not the issue with this Starbucks. What got me writing this review is the fact that there was no apologies- as if it was my fault. The girl opened the cup and pointed to the drink and said there is the espresso. Then went  on to make me a drink that was made correctly.Avoid this location if you have the option.
