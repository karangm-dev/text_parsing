I've stared in the windows for months leading up to the opening of Tina's,  trying to imagine what sort of restaurant it would be...  I'd been busy,  but today I got locked out of my car while shopping at Trader's and I couldn't be more glad because I finally got to check it out and Amazing!!!  It may not be a restaurant,  but it's the even rarer treat of a specialty grocer/deli.  Not only does it have lots of packaged  Eastern Europe/Russian goodies and pickled tastiest and cheeses and soda curiosities and a feast for a curious mind but the meat counter is heaven.  According to the counter gal,  the owner had stocked Whole Foods for years before starting the store and the quality of their wares is such,  I don't doubt her pitch.  Everything is made in house: from the baked goods, to the hand cured meats and sausages, to the flavorful 'salad' items. And they encourage you to try everything!  Their pride in their work was infectious and even as the lovely sales lady was up selling us on all the things we tried I didn't feel pressured,  just swept away with the delightful turn of an unexpected evening. Husband man and I had an easy delicious dinner at home thanks to them and the money we spent on our total purchase (full of additional items for our week) cost only as much as a semi decent dinner out. I will be back and I hope you will take a chance to wander in to their charming home -  so they can stay in business for years to come.  Ps: They respond well to the suggestions of their customers. Fresh in house bread has already been added to their stock and sandwiches are next to come,  according to the storeman.
