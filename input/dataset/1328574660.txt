I'm honestly shocked this location does not have at least a 4 star rating average. We arrived at the Advantage counter at the McCarran Airport Car Rental and fell in the short line, which surprisingly moved rather quickly. Since we were there on our weekly annual family trip, naturally we had a lot of luggage to accompany us.  Our customer service representative, Ali was extremely friendly, helpful & more than accommodating. He went above and beyond and was able to track down a newer Chrysler Pacifica for us that had very low miles. The vehicle was perfect for our family and exceptional on gas mileage (it may have been a hybrid). Sincere thanks to Ali for the smooth and pleasant experience. Advantage should be thankful you're a part of their team. We will be back!
