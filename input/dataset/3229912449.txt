Amazing place to grab a slice! Awesome customer service with a warm and inviting atmosphere. Tony makes time to introduce himself and give wonderful insight on selecting the perfect slice. The garlic knots are delicious and the pizza is fantastic with a true crispy crust. Make sure to grab some cannolis before you go!
