Love the venue. Rude staff.There was a $40 minimum to use a credit card, okay. I bought 2 beers on my tab, and we ended up wanting to go home soon after.When trying to pay the $40 at the bar, the bartender wouldn't let me pay. He said I hadn't reached the minimum amount, and wouldn't listen when I told him I was going to pay the $40. I tried talking to him, but he just walked away. I just wanted to get out of there, he was pissing me off so much because he wouldn't listen.I left with my friend. They ended up charging me the $40 anyways before I could cancel my card. And now I'm missing my visa, and my drivers license, which will cost another $31 to replace.Won't be going back.
