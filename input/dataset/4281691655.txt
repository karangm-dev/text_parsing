The most difficult experience I've ever had try to order a delivery pizza! Haggling over specials posted online,put on hold twice and still no resolution. Called back and stopped order within 2 minutes. Manager was "ok like sorry man,it'll be 45 to an hour". If it's too close to closing then close an hour earlier! Used to love this place--what happened
