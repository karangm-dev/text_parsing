The rental office is located in a run down strip mall in a bad neighborhood.  The air conditioning was out in the business at the time I rented the car and the temperature in the office was near 100 degrees! I paid 38.06 for one day rental of a Ford Focus without any additional coverages.  The car was filthy inside, it had black crud visible on the air conditioning vents and the car smelled like stale cigarette smoke.  I recommend using Priceline or any other internet rental application to rent a car.  This same car was available at your competitors for $10 a day!  Lesson learned.  The referral to this place was a first and a last!!!  I expected way more from Enterprise.  If you're going to rent out a filthy car, make the rental price reflect it.
