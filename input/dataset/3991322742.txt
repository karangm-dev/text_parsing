Place is huge, price is fair, has just about everything related to electronics.... on that note... CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!!Me went to look for TV few months ago, was early in the morning like 8-9am... walked past the counter of about 5 employees huddled around a desk, talking to each other having a grand ol' time! They don't even acknowledge your presence when you look all of them straight in the eye (i usually smile and say hi when I look at people... but I just smiled and kept walking since they didn't seem to care)So I was walking around look for a TV, found one, but didn't have a cart, luckily an employee with a cart walked by... "excuse me, can I borrow that cart, I would like to get this TV"employee #1 - "sorry I have to use this one..."hmmm... okay.... at this point i was pretty pissed off already at all of the people there... so I walked all the way to the front of the store... grabbed the damn cart myself... loaded the TV into the cart... and checked out...I made a complaint to the manager of the store when I got home, basically addressed the "lack of customer service" and how all the employees just like to chit-chat with each other and ignore customers.... all she said was okay, i will address it with that department...Piss-poor customer service.... I think I get better service at Walmart!Anyways... bottom line is... they have a ton of stuff, decent price.... they have a TON of EMPLOYEES that don't know anything about CUSTOMER SERVICE.(To be fair... other times when I do get help, there are decent employees.. but very few)
