Don't go here.  They had our truck for over 5 hours on what they called a slow day and hadn't even looked at it til we finally called to see the progress on the $129 front brake job which they quoted to us.  Magically they called back five minutes later telling us we needed a whole other list of things now to talking over $250.   We should have stayed with Purcells who told us in the first place that we needed brake work.  Thought a specialized brake shop would be better.  Guess not.   Had a previous questionable experience with this shop. Should have known better.  They get you on the fear factor about brakes.  Safety etc.  avoid these guys.
