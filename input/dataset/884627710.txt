Others reviews are ON POINT. Made an appt for 4 o'clock. Was told to go in 15 mins early to do paperwork. At 5 o'clock I was still waiting. So I finally went up to complain about the wait time and THEN they took me in right away. Really? People can't get service without being loud and rude and complaining?If they can't handle their workload then don't schedule so many patients. It's not rocket science.
