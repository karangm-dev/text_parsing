This place was soo amazing!! Came here when they first opened a couple of weeks ago and again tonight. The service was phenomenal as always and the food was crazy good! I love that they have a reg happy hour and a late night happy hour! The chicken tenders are so plump and juicy. I would have never thought to try something called bison meatloaf but holy moley it was so delish (minus the spinach sorry I can't get with the spinach on anything). The spicy thai salad had a pleasant little kick of spice but not crazy crazy spicy  (I appreciate that). The chicken ploblano with tamale cakes was also very yummy. I had a bluberry something martini- that was yum. The white peach sangria- super refreshing and delish. The irish mule was also a pleasantly tasty cocktail. I will say there was one thing I didn't care for that was the turkey meatballs with seeds and such inside (thats probably for a healthier person). EVERYTHING else was soo fricken super deliciously scrumptious I CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK. Do yourself a favor and come here the food is great!
