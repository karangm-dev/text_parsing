I was in town visiting my parents, and they suggested we try Master Pizza. My parents had been here a few times before and loved it, and they couldn't wait for me to try it! Well my parents were right! The pizza is out of this world! Great tasting sauce and fresh veggies for toppings. We also enjoyed the wings, the cherrywood BBQ sauce is delicious!I will be back to Master Pizza next time I come home to Cleveland!
