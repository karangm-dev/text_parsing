Only giving 1 star became i have to so this posts....Directv is terrible in every way. We had service at my house for years but I needed to put it in my name. They shut down the old account on Wednesday and came out Friday to hook up my service.  After hooking everything up he said he couldn't get dish to connect so he left. I was on with customer service Friday,  Saturday and Sunday.  We had another appointment Monday. We sat and waited and no show no call. I call customer service and was on hold for an hour for the girl to put me on hold then hang up on me. So now I  think they can have their equipment back and I'll cancel my ATT cell phones and be done. This is terrible customer service!
