I would give this place 6 stars if I could! I was wanting to try a new place and stumbled upon Flict via Yelp, and I was convinced based on the large amount of great reviews that this would be at least better than the place I had been going, yet it was much more than that. When I walked inside I was immediately impressed by the decor and artwork. Sarah did my hair and I showed her a few pictures I had for ideas, and she really took the time to listen and ask questions to make sure she understood the look I was going for and how my hair is. From there she seemed so excited and I could tell she was having fun with it, as opposed to acting like it was just another hair cut like some other stylists I've been to seem to do. And I love the way it turned out! She's awesome! Everyone at the salon was having fun. In front of each chair is a door with a mirror hanging on it, and being in there was appealing to the eyes with the overall look and decor. Even the bathroom was very clean and nicely decorated. I expected it to cost an arm and a leg, but the pricing is very fair and worth it! I even drove a bit further than I typically do for stuff like this but I'll gladly do it again. If you have any doubts or questions, go to Flict, you will not be disappointed!
