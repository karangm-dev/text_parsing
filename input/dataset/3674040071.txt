I feel bad rating it low.. because of all the other great reviews.. but I just didn't find the same enjoyment that others did. I went on a Sunday evening, with 2 friends and waited at least 15 minutes for our order after it was placed.. During this time we were offered popcorn that tasted stale, when prompting the host about how it tasted she said oh I just made it you must be wrong.. It was odd.. I ordered a hot fudge sundae, for the amount of money I paid I was expecting a  much more amazing treat... This was the hardest review for me to write... I wanted to love it so much, but I simply didn't, and I'm not really ready to try it again..
