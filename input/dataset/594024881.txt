We went there on 9/26/14 with a party of 5 at 10:10pm.  The restaurant supposed to close at 11:00 pm.  When we walked in the waiter gave us a dirty look,  We asked for drinks and he told us all they get is soft drinks.  We ordered 3 won ton noodle and one beef brisket noodle soup.  The soup was luke warm and the won ton was not even heat all the way through.  Tjhe beef brisket was very fatty in a bad way,  The soup had no taste,  When we were half way through our meal the waiter said they had to closed down the register and want us to pa right the wayy.  The other staff was all standing in the dining room and staring at us while we eat.  Overall, the food was bad and expensive for what it was and the service was horrible and they only take CASH.  Would not recommend anyone go there and waste their money.  It is too bad they carry Sam Woo's name and this might lead customers think they are all the same quality.  The ones in LA are much better in terms of food quality and serive.
