Epic Valet?? More like Epic Fail Valet....the young men, while easy on the eyes, were not easy on my car. I watched as they ran over a traffic cone and said nothing, but pulled forward, running over it again, and re-parked. When I asked him about it, he was so rude and inconsiderate, trying to deny what I had just watched happen, that I asked for my keys back, parked four blocks away and walked to the restaurant I was going to for dinner. From now on I will ACTIVELY avoid an epic valet driver from ever sitting a booty in my drivers seat again.
