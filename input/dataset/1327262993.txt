LV.Net is without a doubt the superior choice in high-speed internet!! My only con is that I wish I had known about them sooner! After years of frustration with both Cox and Century Link, I thought sub-standard internet service, terrible customer service, and ever-increasing monthly bills were my inescapable fate.During my initial inquiry call, I was provided a thorough explanation of the services provided, along with pricing, and was able to schedule my installation that same week. The technicians sent were true professionals and worked diligently to have my internet up and running in a short amount of time. It's been five months now since upgrading to LV.Net and my internet has never been better.  I can easily say it's been five months of dependable and reliable service! My teenage son is also a gamer, so the switch to LV.Net has been a real game changer for him, his days of lag and limited connection are thankfully long gone.The purpose of my review is to assure people that there is a better option for their internet needs! LV.Net is a locally owned and operated business which means when you call their customer service you get to talk to a real person in town!!! Not an automated machine, or a representative outsourced from another country, which is personally quite refreshing. We are living in a time of technology, and unlike my past providers, this company has demonstrated that they are ahead of the curve! I do the majority of my work from home, and being able to have a dependable internet connection with unrivaled upload & download speeds is life changing!
