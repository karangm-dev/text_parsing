Love this place! We take our dog once a week for a bath. Facility is immaculately clean and staff extremely nice. There are several shampoos and conditioners available depending on your pets skin/fur needs. Each station has an non-slip mat, lead, scrubbies, 3 large towels, face soap, brush/combs and small hand towel. The tubs have a cut out and step making it very easy on my big dogs loading & unloading. The owner (Dixie) is very friendly and what every you want need she's happy to accommodate- even extra towels!!! Highly recommend this place. Also they have a groomer on site, even though I've never used her, the reviews from other pet owners she's a great find and value. FYI- they have a frequent washer punch card- 6 washes for $70... what a deal!
