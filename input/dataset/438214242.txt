I've visited this store many times in the past and thought I'd put in a mention that I stopped by last night for my Shih Tzu, Romeo Blu, to pick out a birthday treat (and also a Christmas present (psst, a stuffed gingerbread doll toy)- for Christmas morning).  Two store associates approached me to ask if there was something I was looking for.  When inquiring, one of them, a sweet gal happily directed me to a stand that sells various birthday treats (by Molly's Bakery of Canada).  Romeo (actually I) decided on the one cookie treat that would be perfect for him.   Romeo had a nice relaxing time being wheeled around in the shopping cart throughout the store and also enjoyed looking at the adorable kitties in the window (actually he was probably more likely wondering why he was in the store in the first place ;) ).  It was a special birthday for him as he's turned the big 1-0.  He enjoyed sampling the treat on the pedestal stand next to the red & green sparkling candles by our Christmas tree at home (he's a Christmas baby, after all ;) ).Thanks for the pleasant night and for making available the various birthday treats for Romeo :)  (And, BTW, Romeo even met a fellow Shih Tzu shopper there!)
