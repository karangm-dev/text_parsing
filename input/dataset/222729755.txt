Wonderful ambiance, excellent service, great four course wine with food tasting menu and above all, the food was amazing...great presentation and fusion of flavors.  The only negative was the lack of lower or mid-price point wines.  On the other hand if you are a connoisseur of fine wines, you will love it.
