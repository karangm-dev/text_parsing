Having lived in Philly I can truly say this place has the most authentic cheese steak I have had in Arizona... and I have lived in Az for over 20 years. What's even better is the owners are the nicest people I have ever met. I threw them a couple bucks in tip (because the cheese steak was so amazing) and they were so appreciative.Wish I could give this place 6 out of 5 stars. Not kidding.
