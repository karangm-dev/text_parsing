I was in Vegas for work and had 5-star meals lined up every night.  Milos did NOT disappoint.   It's not wild and crazy like STK, it's more low key and you can actually hear each other during dinner conversation.  It is definitely a more grown up cool crowd.  The interior was an expensive buildout and it is comfortable and elegant.  I have to say, the Cosmopolitan in general is a very elegant property with artistic finishes. The grilled octopus was amazing!! They have a beautiful wine list!! I had the Lobster which was spectacular!!  The seared tuna plate was PLENTIFUL and delicious.  I was more than pleased with this choice and it is definitely worth trying.  The damage was I think about half as big as the other dinners at Nobu or Michael Mina. My other friend had the salmon and it was HUGE.  Everyone  I was there with are all pretty much bonafide foodies, and we all agreed this was a great meal.  I am going back for this lunch I keep reading about...
