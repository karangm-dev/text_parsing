The food is good, but they're terribly slow. I just went there for a grilled cheese and a cup of tomato soup and I was there for over twenty minutes waiting for my sandwich. I'm pretty confident that I could've made the sandwich myself with a Bic lighter if they'd handed over the ingredients. And I wasn't the only one waiting. There was a woman behind me pushing 15 minutes for a cup of soup, another pushing 20 for a salad. The thing that really blows my mind about the wait times at Barriques is that they don't appear to be understaffed.What's up, guys? If you want the business that Bluephie's Diner's departure could yield, a grilled cheese is going to require less wait time than half of my lunch break, which is exactly what I wasted there today.
