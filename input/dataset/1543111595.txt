Originally from Cali, i found out that my barber nikko worked here, and definitely one of the nicest shops I've been to. I felt very under dressed walking  in with a cut off shirt as I was going to the gym after the haircut. As I entered the building I was offered beverages, which was a nice change for me. The atmosphere was relaxed and enjoyable. It wasn't over crowded, and just felt like a good place to get a cut. As I finished my haircut the front desk lady was super nice and friendly. I definitely see myself coming back here. I recommend this place to anyone!
