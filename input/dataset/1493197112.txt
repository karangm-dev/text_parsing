This place is an absolute gong show (on a Saturday afternoon).The good: Lots of seatingThe bad: Lots of university student laptop hobos taking up entire tables sitting aloneThe good: Four or five cashiers with runnersThe bad: They are really disorganized and don't seem to know who's job is who's.The good: The line moves quickly.The bad: The customers standing in it seem like they've never been in a Tim Hortons before and don't know what's going on.There was tons of confusion happening at this location. There were people loitering that looked like they were in line, but weren't. It took a couple of tries for the staff to get the drink order right for the guests ahead of me. Other staff seemed to be running around like chickens with their heads cut off but no actual direction. The cashiers seemed to be trying to run food and make drinks while taking orders and confusing their runners.Just not good.November challenge 3/30
