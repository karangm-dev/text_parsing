Oh crap, I should have finished writing my review for Harvey's immediately after dining there, because now, for the life of me, I can't remember what I had for dinner.   That alone may speak volumes about my experience; but what I can piece together from my poor memory was that the evening was in total, immemorable.   Food, service, atmosphere all mediocre.Not the type of place I'd choose to eat a full blown meal at again, but perhaps grab a beer, some wings and watch a few games.
