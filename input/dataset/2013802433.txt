I've been to many whole foods (due to work travel) and typically love their salad bar, prepared foods section, and fresh produce.  This location in particular, was a huge disappointment.  In my salad, there were 4 different things I had to pull out because they were sour, and from the produce section, my apples were not ripe, and once I peeled open my orange, I found it was rotten. Considering the amount they charge for their groceries, I would minimally expect fresh food.  The quality and taste of the items in the prepared section was quite subpar to other whole foods.
