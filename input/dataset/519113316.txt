Every single time I've been here, whoever is at the register seems to have a huge stick up their ass. Prices aren't too great for what you get. Actually, the food isn't even that good, period. Only time I ever think to come here is if I want asada fries. But then I remember how terrible the staff is, and my craving subsides.
