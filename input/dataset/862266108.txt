We have eaten here several times.  The food is outstanding and the owner is awesome.  He stopped by our table and found out we had never been there before.  We talked dishes and appetizers.  Then, he surprised us with 2 free appetizers.  He said, once you see that all the food is good, I know you'll be back.   How call is that!  Fyi-- food was and is great!
