Would never go back. I ordered a gyro without tomatoes and my friend ordered a regular gyro wrap. His was out in a few minutes while mine wasn't out for about 15. When he set my gyro out the person working the register remind him that there was no tomato so he took it by the trash can and picked off each tomato. When I finally got my food there was still tomatoes on it so I went back and complained, the man who made it got mad and threw it into the thrash can and made me a new one. 20 minutes later I finally got to sit down and eat but the gyro had cold thin meat on it and way too many onions. Too many good places to eat ever eat here again.
