Bryce sounded caring on the phone and kept promising that he'd help me take care of the pool but it all fell through at the end. He first charged me $800+ to change my filter and drain + acid wash my pool. The pool was ok for a month and then the water level got too low so the water turned green again. I kept trying to find him to help me get the water level back but he was no where to be found.
