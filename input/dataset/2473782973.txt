It was Easter and decided on Filipino food in our neighborhood.  We had a party of 6 and they automatically charged 18% gratuity.  We ate the buffet $10.99 pp which was mostly pork dishes; Pork sinigang, pork sisig, Lechon, dinuguan, pork and opo vegetable, pork caldereta.  They had Kare Kare 2 hrs earlier when we passed by but the lady said they weren't making anymore.  My husband really wanted it so he ordered the a la carte menu.  Kids ordered the halo halo and found a hair in it! We brought this to the attention of our server and another lady came out and asked, "do you want me to bring another one?" We said absolutely not, and did not offer a refund right away.  We all lost our appetite at this point.  She asked to see the hair and we had a look of disgust and asked why, and she said so she can find out who's it was!  We gave her the napkin and she left.  Later we went to get fruit and noticed they had a full tray of Kare Kare in the buffet area.  Wow we just finished ordering the Kare Kare for $12.99 and they did not offer a refund.  I as a Filipina thought the food was okay, Kare Kare was probably the best dish.  Service was ok, not deserving the automatic 18% for sure.  My husband said we won't be coming back ever again.
