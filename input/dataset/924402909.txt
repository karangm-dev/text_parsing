{**Hey There**}I met up with my hubs and another couple here on a random Sunday afternoon...around 3 or 4. Considering this place is off of a busy road I was surprised it wasn't busier! We decided to sit at the bar (the best seat in the house) and our bartender was quick to greet us. She was extremely personable with us and the other bar patrons and you could tell the staff had a good rapport with each other. Lots of smiles, laughs, banter and productive all at the same time. **kudos guys**Alright, so I ordered the guava coconut cocktail and wow. Wow wow wow. It's all things coconut and fresh and scrumptious and refreshing all at the same time! My party were lame and two of them ordered Coronas the entire time but again the waitress was spot on and kept them coming.We shared an order of guacamole and salsa and all I can say is **Y U M** the food that they kept bringing out for everyone else smelled delicious AND looked amazing. I can say that I will be back to try more of the liquid menu but also the food. Updates to be expected in the future.*cheers*
