Came here with a large group of 8 after the MJ Cirque Due Soleil show.   While we were seated promptly it took forever for any server to come and give us water.  We decide to order the guacamole which was bland and lacked any flavor besides a strong onion flavor (some spice, salt, and lime was needed).Unfortunately the meal was far from redeeming.  I ordered the beef quesadilla.  The outershell was soaked in oil and unedible and it was loaded with so much cheese that it overpowered the beef so I ended up picking the quesadilla to push everything to the side except for the beef, which was cooked well but could have been seasoned better.It had an expansive menu which was great for people who have a wide range of preferences in food, however that was unfortunately the only good thing I experienced at Border Grill.
