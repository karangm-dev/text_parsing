I've always been a fan of the razor because it's inexpensive and pain-free, despite its annoying need of every-other-day maintenance. Meh - the trade off was more than worth it in my eyes.But shaving my bikini area was a big hassle and NOT as easy as shaving my legs, so last Boxing Day (2014) I decided to take the plunge and go for a Brazilian. Forget about dipping my toes in the water - I'm a tough cookie and figured I'd go all in.Based on Yelp reviews, I booked Melanie and she was just fantastic. Explained everything to me in detail, had 30 Rock playing and took a break whenever I needed. Because it was my first time waxing (anything), I was unaware you had to trim first, so I'm sure that ramped up the pain level. And though I went in for a Brazilian, I couldn't go through with it and Melanie suggested we stop at a thong-kini instead.I was all set to see Melanie again tomorrow but because of scheduling conflicts, I had to rebook with Charise. She, too, was simply amazing: super nice, took cues from me in conversing instead of pushing the chitchat, told me why both hard and soft wax are used, and was incredibly quick. I also learned my lesson from the first time and trimmed, and the result was just about as pain-free as one can get from waxing.So, it's $40 for a thong-kini. Pricey? Perhaps, a little bit. But when I think about not having to bother with a razor anymore and being able to enjoy my thong-kini for about a month, it's well worth it.
