I am INCREDIBLY disappointed after reading all these great reviews. Perhaps the doctor is great, but his staff is AWFUL. I called to say I was running late. Left a message because no one answered. Nowhere does it say anything about if you're 15minutes late that your appointment will have to be rescheduled. I get there just over 15 minutes late and the woman at the front desk was nothing but rude and unpleasant. She claims she called me back but it didn't go through. Apparently she hit the call back button and it didn't go through. That was the only attempt she made. She didn't bother to actually dial the number I left. I am getting visibly upset as I try to figure out a solution as I have been sick for two weeks and can't afford urgent care, and certainly can't afford to get any sicker, and she LAUGHS at me. She tells me she can't get me in until next Tuesday. I ask to speak to someone else as she's made it clear it isn't up to her. She calls in a gentleman who is the only one who says halfway nice. He steps out and sends in another woman who is also AWFUL. She continues to repeat herself saying she doesn't know what to tell me and she can't help me. She gets snappy with me and rudely says "then go to urgent care!" At which point I explain I can't afford urgent care and isn't it their whole purpose to help people out who don't have insurance. She shrugs her shoulders and again with a horrible tone says "I don't know what to tell you." And the whole time, mind you, the phone lady is continuing to argue and defend her lack of effort to reach me. I am a grown woman who has never broken down crying after dealing with unpleasant people. But they managed to change that. God forbid I get any more ill...
