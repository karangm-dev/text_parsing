I like this place a lot. Today was my first time there and I am very pleased with the results :)I was asked how thick or thin I would like my eyebrows to be and she actually listened when I told her what I wanted!If there was a store closer to my side of town I'd go there every time (my job is close and I went on a break). Not to mention the prices are more than reasonable.Clean store, friendly staff!
