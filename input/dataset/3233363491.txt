Didn't even have to eat here to have a bad experience. I wanted to go here for my Bday dinner but unfortunately they make it impossible. First off, you can't make a reservation so good luck trying to have a party larger than 5 seated in a reasonable time. Sure you can "call-ahead" an hour before and they will try to get something put together for you by the time you plan to show up, but no promises. And you better have your whole party there on time or else you SOL because they apparently aren't there to cater to you. And to top it off, I hope you didn't want to sit with everyone you invited... because that's not going to happen. But they will do their best to get you all sitting in the same general area in booths that are side to side or back to back. Makes for real great conversation when you can't even sit next to the people koi invited. And I hope your ok with picking and choosing which family members and friends are good enough to sit at your table. Anyways, I made the easy decision of changing my party location to Logans across the street and they took my reservation without issue and will be seating us all together.
