Was approached in our neighborhood by a few guys in regards to our windshield. I knew it was cracked but hadn't really put much into replacing the glass. I asked "Cody" what the incentives were to go through their company and he said, "We are doing a free tint strip and a lifetime guarantee  (although this company has changed names)", my daughter had a birthday party coming up and know that a lot of company's offer some sort of rebate check so when I brought it up, he assured me they could give me a $60 check at the time of service, so I agreed because of the check.  Well the next day they went to my boyfriend's work to replace the windshield and to my surprise my boyfriend didn't mention a check. I text Cody and said we never received the check and that I would go to my insurance company due to their fraudulent activity, so he had a manager call me to assure me that a check was going out in the mail... WELL a week later and there still is no check. I text Cody about my displeasure and shockingly there was no response. This is a terrible company who lures people in with promises they can't keep. I would never recommend them.
