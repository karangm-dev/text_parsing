Came across this shop while at the deli next door for lunch. I had been looking to buy my first bike in a long time and been to some of the bike shops around town only to receive luke warm responses. Not PHX Bike. I walked in and saw a cool, small, local shop and knew I was in the right place. The owner Palmer was enthusiastic and pumped that I wanted to get a bike. He took his time explaining things that I should look for and didn't treat me like some like an outsider. So, I did some research on his recommendations and a few weeks later went back ready to buy the bike he reccomended. I was stoked, but I think Palmer was even more stoked. As I was walking out he said, "You're going to have a new bike in a couple days!"This guy is knowledgeable, genuine and I look forward to being a long time customer.
