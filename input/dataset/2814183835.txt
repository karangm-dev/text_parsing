If you know how to work out then this can be a good gym. However there are several machines that don't work properly and could harm your members and then you'll be in a world of trouble. Because there are many consistent comments on how your equipment is being properly maintained. I've been working out for years and I know when I see bad equipment. But I know the basics of weightlifting and if you know that, you can produce results. I would like to know where is the pride of working? Doesnt anyone in your staff know how to keep the the dumbbells  in order? They are all over the whole gym and none match on the rack. You must find it within yourself to improve this gym if you want to stop getting negative comments. That means you manger. That means you associate. Take some responsibility and enjoy where you work at. Fix this gym to where you get positive vibes. You'll feel better about it and know that you can accomplish anything.
