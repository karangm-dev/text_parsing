What happened to Roy's?? Their butterfish used to be to die for and now it's a defrosted slice of mush. The edamame comes from a freezer bag. Even the salmon which is a normally a no-fail standby ended up tasting disappointing. The service was so slow. If it takes you that long to take my drink order and then to bring my drink order there is no way the evening is going to get back on track. Nope. The dessert cake even came out burned. Ugh. I can't believe we paid money for this.
