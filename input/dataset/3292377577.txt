I had a fantastic experience at Silhouette Bridal, and would highly recommend it! The space is gorgeous, to start, and the staff were all incredibly nice. Soondis, was so sweet, and understood what I was looking for. She did a great job and wasn't pushy or too sales-y. She even made time for me to come back at the end of the day to try on my two favorites again, despite being fully booked. They really went out of their way to make sure I had a great experience.In the end, I bought a gorgeous dress, and could NOT be happier! YAY for Soondis.
