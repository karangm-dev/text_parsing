We have Dine-Rewards with Outback and so we either dine in or order from the Outback on Clearview Avenue in Mesa all the time. Our dine-in orders are fine, but the staff just can't get our order right when we place it to go. Either they don't give us credit towards our Dine-Rewards program or they mess up our order...EVERY SINGLE TIME. About a month ago, we ordered four meals and my husband's meal was missing entirely when he got home and discovered it. He called the manager immediately and had to drive back over there to get his entr√©e. Then a couple of weeks ago, we place a "to-go" order and when we got it home my order of broccoli was missing. I wrote the manager but haven't heard a thing back.We are pretty tired of our takeout orders being messed up each time, so we may have to forego going there, even though we love the food.
