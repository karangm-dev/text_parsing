Today decided to take my fiancé to a authentic Mexican restaurant and one that's local, bingo, Border MX is the place.  A quaint small restaurant has friendly service and reasonably clean.  My fiancé had the chicken fajitas and I had the Evil shrimp which had a heavenly taste.  Wash it down with Mexican mango pop and churros that had a wonderful taste.  Prices are decent for dinner for two less than $50.  Will return again.
