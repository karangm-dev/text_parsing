First of all, I have been at Honey Salt several times.  And each time In all fairness, they are very slow!  There was only 3 other couples o. The whole place today!  I tried the spicy sausage and green olive pizza. I thought that it was only OK. I can personally make a better pizza at home than this.  The sausage was not spicy at all, it was very bland.  I know that the better choice at Honey Salt is the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich.  I have had the chicken sandwich on another occasion, and it it good.
