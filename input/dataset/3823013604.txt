This Safeway is nice and clean like all typical Safeways, but the lines are terrible! There are a lot of elderly people who shop here and still use their checkbooks in both the regular line and the "express" line, and these type of transactions are usually at least five minutes long. I really wish they had a self-checkout line for customers who are only buying a handful of items and know how to use a debit/credit card! If you're in no hurry and have a great deal of patience, this is definitely a nice spot to grab your weekly groceries or a few snacks. Skip this place if you're trying to pick something up during a lunch break because you will be in here for a while!
