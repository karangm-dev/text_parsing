My daughter and I went here for pedicures earlier this week and had a wonderful time.  Rita and Bella were so attentive and we truly felt pampered.  Our toes are beautiful and our feet feel wonderful!  I will be switching to Millennium for my acrylic nails next time I need a fill as well.  Thank you ladies!
