My friends and I came here during a Cleveland brewery crawl and I loved the beers here the best! I did order a Rum flight just because but in the future I will stick to sampling beers. The rum was good but too strong for my tastebuds. The beer here is outstanding! I love how many beers there were to choose from and my top 2 favorites are Walk the Plank Wheat Wine (beer mixed with wine...yes please!) and the Mayo Irish Red Ale.
