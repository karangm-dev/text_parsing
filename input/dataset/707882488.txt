You get what you pay for :(  Allegiant was the cheapest deal, but they really get you with all sorts of fees.  You have to pay for checked luggage (most airlines let you at least bring one for free) and the weight is 40lbs not the usually 50.  We had to pay to have our seats together, pay to use a credit card to book the flight and once on the flight NOTHING was free, not even water.  It was a 6 hour flight!! Seriously?!?  The seats had no air vents, not seat pockets and the seats did not even recline. On our flight there we sat next to a woman who was traveling with her husband for their 20th wedding anniversary.  Their seats were not together.  There was a back row in the plane empty and when they asked if they could move back there, the flight attendants told them they would have to pay!  WHAT!?! When we were scheduled to fly back, we got an email earlier in the week that our flight was moved from 8:30 am to 11:30 am.  We arrived at the airport around 8:30 am (because it said on our ticket that we needed to be there 2.5 hours before the flight) and no one was there.  Every other airline had people working, but not Allegiant.  We were flying back from Hawaii and had to go to an agricultural check before even checking in.  That was also closed.  We tried to go to another one, but they said we had to go to the one for allegiant and it didn't open until 9. So we waited.......finally two employees came strolling up, breakfast in hand.  We got our bags checked and then moved to the next line where we waiting some more. They checked in about 5 people and then said they had to stop because the baggage was getting backed up.  After 5 people??  Really???  It was an hour before we even made it into the actually airport.  I am giving it one star because at least (for the most part) the flight attendants were pleasant.
