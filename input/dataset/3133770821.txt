87 West is awesome!  The decor and fireplace create a hip and cozy atmosphere.  I have been here twice now and everything has been delicious!  My favorite dishes:the grilled four cheese - so many yummy cheeses and melted perfectlythe chorizo flatbread - super delish, perfect combination of toppingsthe baked brie - love the combination of brie and sweet compote the carbonara - really good carbonara sauce, my only wish is that it had pancetta instead of chicken an baconThe wine list and wait staff also added to the awesomeness.  Our waitress was super friendly, nice and good at her job. I will definitely be back soon!
