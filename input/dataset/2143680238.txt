A nice visit at first. Walked into a nice quant salon full of sweet people. They say me down and everyone was very friendly.  Now, I am a earthy natural person who is open to subtle highlights and likes to keep it simple. I came in with light root growth from previous hardly noticeable highlights looking to have something light to touch it up. The owner was very kind and seemed like a very personable man. I talked to him and explained how subtle was the name of the game. He said he understood and that was the end of it. HE USED CHEEP BLEACH ON MY HAIR and made it way WAY too light. I told him it was too light and he said I needed to get use to it. Went into a different light and IT GOT WORSE! you could hardly see my roots before and how I have very dark roots and he just did my hair an hour ago! Trying a new look can be fun except when when he makes you look like a cheep hooker! Do not use him, he uses cheep products with little concern for what the person wants
