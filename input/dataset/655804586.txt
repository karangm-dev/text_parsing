What a ripoff!! I would give this place negative stars if I could! $21 for an 18' Supreme Pizza with maybe three pieces of pepperoni per slice and light ingredients on the whole pie. Whoever is making their pizzas doesn't know how to put toppings on a pizza. I bet if it was their pizza it would of been loaded lol!! If you want to spend your money on mostly dough, this is the perfect place! Next time I'll go to Smiths and buy a frozen pizza instead lol!
