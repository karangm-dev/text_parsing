I had wanted to try Sapori for a long time, especially with so many nice reviews.  I finally ordered take out on a Saturday after a long day of yard work.  Honestly, I was disappointed.  The food was very average at best and, in my opinion, doesn't come close to nearby competitors like Fratellos, Nino's, etc.  The Chicken Parmigiana was better than the Scarpariello.  The Scarpariello had what seemed like a sweetness to the sauce...which definitely doesn't go with garlic, hot peppers, and sausage.  Sorry, the menu looks so good and I wanted to like it, but the flavors and quality just were not there.
