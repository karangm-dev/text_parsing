The curds were definitely the highlight, they remind me a lot of the Old Fashioned. The menu had interesting sandwich options, but we didn't enjoy them very much. Burgers were average, dry bun. The Italian beef was small and seemed more like a pot roast sandwich without the gravy.The service was rough and confused. Two servers were switching between us, and had a hard time keeping track of us even though it wasn't particularly busy. I received the wrong meal twice.
