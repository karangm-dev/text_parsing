Living in Texas the past five years prevented us from visiting our favorite restaurant, Roy's, where we have happily spent many an Anniversary and/or Birthday.  Now back in Phoenix, we went to the Roy's at the Marriott where we have been before.  The food was very good.  My wife had Salmon and thought it was the best she had ever had.  I had the Ono and it was good, if not a bit overcooked.  The service was way, way below par.  Normally at Roy's you are showered with greetings from everyone as you walk to your table.  This night....crickets.  We sat outside and since our last visit (6 years ago), they have formed a large, informal seating area to augment the dining tables.  So, as we are beginning our meal, about 8 people plopped themselves down - all having just come from the pool.  A few were very loud and instantly, Roy's became a Pub.  They ordered pool-side food and the atmosphere was shattered.  Roy's invited this by setting up this seating area.  We finished our meals and the plates sat on the table for nearly 10 minutes as the wait staff disappeared.  This is 180 degrees different from how Roy's used to be.  I spoke with the manager and reminded him that we were there to celebrate my wife's birthday and that we wanted to move indoors to have our dessert and coffee.  They obliged us and were apologetic.  So, all in all, the food remained good, if not overpriced, but the attention, service and outdoor atmosphere took a big bite out of the experience.  Sadly will think twice about returning.
