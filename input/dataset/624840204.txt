Before I arrived for an afternoon of friends, pedicures and a little wine, I had I had gone online and looked at the website before arriving. And, although, I am so tired of the chop shop nail salons, for me to spend $35+ for a pedicure, it better be a great experience. Walking in, I had my doubts.We were celebrating my girlfriend's birthday and three had of us emerged on to this cute little spot so conveniently located next to The Grind - but that's another review for another time.I walked in, a few minutes after 3 p.m., to find my friends sipping on water and choosing their toe nail colors. I was welcomed by an employee and asked if I would like iced water or tea. Okay, pretty good start...I am overtaken by all the boutique-y details and start to stroll the salon. It is super cute. And, as I look around, I become more comfortable with the services price list because it is obvious that they are going to build the value around the entire experience.I sit down to have my pedicure and Katrina interjects naturally into the conversation that my friends and I are having as she starts the battle my snaggle-toes. I don't fight. My toes do, but I let her do what she needs to do. Katrina wins and I end up with short, even, well buffed, super shiny polished toes. They are gorgeous! The experience was amazing. The pedicure friendly and I can't wait to go back. And, if that wasn't enough, someone from the salon called my girlfriend (who made the appointment and paid for all the services) to see how our pedicures were holding up. Really? Thanks, Sundrops Nail Spot for the Sunny Side of Hospitality! Love it!
