I work at studio g architecture, a company based out in henderson. I love this company and our current technician Chris. He's quick and polite and when we're having meetings downstairs he gets the service done without being disruptive. Really don't want to lose our technician as I learned they'll have a new team strictly doing commercial offices. Have yet to see any bugs/insects in our office, very pleased!!
