Really inept service. I placed a detailed ballon order 3 days in advance, and my husband went to pick up the order (on time, not early)-- it wasn't ready, he didn't group them as specified on the order AND he didn't bag them as specified on the order. What is the point of placing an order ahead if they can't even follow it?
