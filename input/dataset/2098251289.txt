On the road to recovery! THANK YOU DR. ANDERSON YOURE MY HERO!!!!  Love Princess Grace ( Gracie ) Traveling with my Gracie across the country when much to my dismay her health took a turn and it wasn't looking great for Princess Grace until we discovered the Boca Park Animal Hospital. When I thought I would have to part with my long time companion ( 14 years) and best friend Dr Anderson swooped in like a knight in shining armor! I instantly felt secure that My Gracie would be well taken care of even though we were so far from home.I was on vacation with an already slim budget and fearing the worst for Gracie and my wallet . Dr Anderson and her staff offered comfort caring and non judgemental advice. Even though we are not out of the woods yet, I feel that I have been informed to make the best choices for my baby to bring her to her best as we continue our travels.THANK YOU BOCA PARK ANIMAL HOSPITAL! Thank you Dr Anderson and also to Jayme Theriault who assisted in the loving care of Princess Grace while at the hospital.
