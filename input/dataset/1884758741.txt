The quality of food has completely dropped off. I been looking forward to this buffet ever since I found out I was going back to Vegas but it was nothing like I remembered. There was nothing there that was absolutely delicious. This will probably be the last time I eat here and will stick with Wynn/Rio/Planet Hollywood buffets. Perhaps we ate here on a bad day (Thursday). The only good thing bout this place is that the waiter is very attentive and is always checking on you to see if you need anything else.
