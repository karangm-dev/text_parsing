Customer Service: We were greeted right away by the host, she then introduced us to our server Becky. Becky was extremely attentive, professional, and went above and beyond to make sure that we were in good hands. Food: The fried cheese and watermelon was a great combination to start with. The watermelon was sweet and the cheese on top gave it a salt finish which was perfect.Deviled Eggs - I'm a deviled egg connoisseur which is why I chose to dine at this restaurant. I must say that the dill, and fish eggs was also a perfect pairing to my palette. By far, one of the best deviled eggs I've had. Fried Green Tomatoes: The fried green tomatoes had a crispy texture, topped with a creamy pimento cheese, and crispy pork belly. The combination of the three was good and addicting. I highly recommend that you try it.Salty Caramel Bread Pudding: Is definitely one of my favorite desserts. It was light and fluffy, with a cream base, topped with candied pecans, drizzled with salty caramel, and a dollop of sweet whipped cream on the side. This is also the best bread pudding, ever! This will definitely be my go to restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip.
