I can understand the hype around this place but it definitely was a disappointment for me. You come here for the ambience and the downtown feel, not the food that they serve. It definitely has a good bar feel.Onto the food. People rave about the ramen here but I found it exceedingly salty. I've been to a lot of ramen places and I'd say this place is in the bottom half. In Madison I've tried umami and ramen kid and definitely enjoyed those more than this one. The broth didn't have the good meaty flavor and I just have to mention how salty it is again.Don't get me wrong, the restaurant is nice and a good hang out, but don't come here if you're looking for authentic ramen.
