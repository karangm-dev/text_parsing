Lady Bug is nothing special. I've had lunch here six or seven times. The portions are small considering the high prices. The hot roast beef sandwich with melted cheese is not much better than what I've had from an AM/PM microwave. The way they wrapped it to go, made the whole bun a soggy mess. There was hardly any meat on the bun. The potato salad tastes like Resers. The food isn't horrible, but for the money, you can do a lot better.
