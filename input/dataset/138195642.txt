Polar Air has provided me with probably the WORST A/C service I've ever had.  I've had the tech out to look at my A/C unit several times.  The first service call was because the air wasn't blowing at all, and that only some vents seemed to have airflow through them.  The tech told me that he needed to order a new part.  Fast forward 2 weeks and between their customer service department telling me they ordered the wrong part, and the tech telling me that the part was installed already (after the service department admitted that they don't actually have the correct part yet) and this has just been a fiasco.  I've resorted to taping strips of tissue to my vents to show the tech the lack of airflow.  Still, after all of this, my A/C is lukewarm.  I not only recommend against Polar Air in the Las Vegas area, but I will tell any and everyone who asks to literally go to any one else.  Joey the HVAC tech is especially one to avoid.
