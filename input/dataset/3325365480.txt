Just finished our first take out order from this location and we were not impressed. We tried an assortment of rolls, sashimi, salads and sushi pizza. Everything looked great but was completely lacking in flavor. The sashimi was minutes from being off, but what really killed it was the packaged crab and frozen salad shrimps used in the seafood Fuji bowl. Considering the price of our meal ... we expected much more. We will take our Friday night sushi dinner elsewhere from now on.
