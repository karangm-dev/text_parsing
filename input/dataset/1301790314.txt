So after watching The Avengers I was a bit curious as to what Shawarma was, I did not understand Iron Man's craving for this magical "Shawarma" but I was intrigued and determined to find out. On a day out with my mom we could not decide what we wanted to eat, but I was starving for something different. She said we could eat Greek, something something chicken, at first I was hesitant, "chicken", it's not my favorite meat, but I was up for the challenge. As soon as we got to Parsley during this monsoon-like Las Vegas weather a huge raindrop landed in my eye, I guess it must have been good luck that I was visually impaired, it was indeed a sign from Zeus himself saying "Feast on the nectar of the Gods my dear child.".Luckily this place not only has Chicken Shawarma but also Beef Shawarma so I opted for the latter in wrap form with all the works and an added treat of those beautiful olives. The serving size was more than enough for me, I could only eat half my wrap, and beware these wraps can get messy.This place is on an popping on those rainy days I might add with all sorts of people, it's kinda cool. The customer service is really great! Lots of friendly people. The layout if this place is pretty small. I'd say 30 people max? There is outdoor seating though.For those who say "Ehh, it's not the best Shawarma." I wonder what really good quality Shawarma taste like because this is just fabulous. Sorry for this mini epic, but now I know what Iron Man was on about, we should listen more often ;)
