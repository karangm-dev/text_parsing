Literally the worst costumer service I have ever had... we walked up this morning to get a table and the hostess asked us if we had a reservation and we told her no. She said " Its Saturday sweetie you can't go to brunch in Vegas without a reservation, we don't have any tables available". We could clearly see there was about five tables open right behind her and she didn't ask or offer to put our name on the a list. She just said there was no tables... I will never go back to that place after this. Seriously so rude.
