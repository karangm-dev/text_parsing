I went here many months ago for lunch, right after they first opened.  Food is good but the service was terrible. I decided not to Yelp then, because I know it can take time for new restaurants to "work out the kinks". Went back today (at least 6 months later) for lunch, and it was the same thing- food was good, service was just unacceptable. I will not be back, which is a shame since I work so close and love sushi.
