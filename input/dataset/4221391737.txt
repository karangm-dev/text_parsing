Large or Small? Large or Small?My bowl of Large Bun Bo Hue ($7.50) just looked so sad. A few pieces of thin dark meat which I assumed were the beef shank and 2 piece of Vietnamese sausage. All other meats missing in action?! The soup is a weak version of beef broth just add some hot chili oil and lemongrass (reminds me of the paste I can get the supermarket next door)Portion was on the small size or did I order the small by mistake? But I was sure it was the right order as the lady that took my order gave me the bill too.Maybe I should have just order the Pho?!Maybe I should have just skip Pho Dai Nam?
