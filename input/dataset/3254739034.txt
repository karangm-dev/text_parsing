Food was not good. We ordered 5 items and on ALL items, the spice level was WAY higher than it should have been. One of the items - beef pad Thai - we ordered as level 0 ... No spice at all for my daughter who has health issues and cannot handle spicy very well. It was more like a 4. On the pad see ew - the noodles had a strange taste and the Chinese broccoli was NOT fresh at all. The only thing I can say positive was about the delivery time - it was scheduled for 7-7:10 but actually arrived at 6:45 which is always a nice surprise. Unfortunately, that did not make up for the poor quality of the food so we will not be ordering from here again.
