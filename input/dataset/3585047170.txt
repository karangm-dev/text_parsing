This spot is a much needed for a barren restaurant area in uptown. The space itself is spacious, well designed and beautiful. The food is innovative, fresh and delish. The staff is  knowledgeable about the menu. I also appreciated the fact that on a busy Saturday night, they had a well staffed bar where you never had a wait. (Take note other restaurants, 5 bartenders is definitely how you do it!)As someone who was finishing Whole30 and ventured out anyway, the staff was kind and unbothered by my 15 questions. They made me several fantastic sugar free mocktails and didn't complain about the hassle. Very great experience!
