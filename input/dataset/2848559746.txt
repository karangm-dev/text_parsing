CONSUMERS BEWARE RIP OFF COMPANYThese guys are nothing but liars!!!! I talked to the owner of the company Randy to have my Semi truck towed in and repaired, Explained exactly what was wrong and was told he wouldhave it done the next day. Well that was a big fat lie. First off, the towing took 4 hours longerto get my truck picked up that they told me, the repairs were going to take 2 days longer thanI was told, said they were backed up, He should have known they were backed up the dayI talked to him. Wasted 20 hours of my time and cost almost $1400 in tow bills, Had to get it towed to a better shop for the repairs which were done the same day as promised. I have a lot of trucks on the road for years and they sometimes break down and I use various repair shops so I am not new at this at all. However I have never been treated this way, so rude and just flat out lied about everything. I am warning every trucking company I know about them.DO NOT USE THESE GUYS, THEY ARE NOTHING BUT A JUNK YARD WITH A TOW TRUCK AND A RIP OFF, NOTHING BUT  RUDE LIARS. FROM THEIR TOWING TO THEIR REPAIR SHOP, AND ESPECIALLY THE OWNER RANDY, NO ETHICS, MORALS OR INTEGRITY AT ALL CANT BELIEVE THEY ARE EVEN IN BUSINESS.
