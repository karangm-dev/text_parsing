Sunday 6/24/2018 Jose came out to assist us with our A/C unit. It went down the morning before and AHS sent Doctor Cool out to do our repairs. After reading the mixed reviews here i was rather skeptical and was not sure what to expect..  we have had other repair folks out from the home warranty company.. the fridge went out and that company had to come 3x just to fix it.. our pool pump went out and that company also took multiple visits to fix the issue.. long story short... Jose was very professional.. He let us know what was going on through the entire process and when he left everything was running great.. Doctor Cool definitely has a great employee in Jose and he did an outstanding job.. He made sure we were informed and happy with what he had done before he left... hats off to Jose and Doctor Cool for taking care of our needs.
