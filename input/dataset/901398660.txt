We have been here before and it was good.  Today we watched the cook cough and hack all over our food while cooking. It is an open kitchen so you can watch them cook.  No attempt to turn away from the food or cover his mouth.  It was really bad.  We left and cancelled the food.  I felt really bad about canceling our order but there was no way we were going to eat it.  The waitress and very nice.  Beware of the cook
