I just had Austin come check my AC-and heater.  He was awesome!  I actually learned a few things today he took pictures and video of how my AC and heater is working and explained precisely how well they are working and what I needed to be aware of for future maintenance.   I highly recommend this company!  Austin was extremely knowledgeable about everything and anything to do with heating and AC units.   He even helped me with my home warranty.   I couldn't ask for better service!
