Food is too salty. Service was horrible. Only one member of our party of six received their food, while the rest of us waited more than an hour after they received their food. Was there for a birthday celebration. Brought our own cake. Waited forever for the waiter to bring the cake and then he brought out only one piece with the sparklers burnt half way down. The point was to bring out the WHOLE cake withe the sparklers still burning when they reach the table. The waiter was horrid as was the food. I will NEVER go back...despite the fact that many have told me it was an isolated incident...I think it would be too coincidental to have a terrible waiter and chef on the same night.
