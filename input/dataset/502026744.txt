It don't hurt that I know one of the owners, and get along with the family in general, but they have the best bar food in Charlotte. It must be uncle Donnie, because the other guy couldn't fix a pb and j. Their pork tenderloin was the first I had tried this, now it's one of my specialties, wings are always great, not a big adventure person in foods, but would try most stuff that came out of their kitchen.
