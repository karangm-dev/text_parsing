So for the game last week, I was visiting this side of town and Amy was the highlight of our experience at el hefe although it was balls to the wall packed, Amy, the bartender, noticed us right away and somehow remembered our groups drinks along with few others and whipped them all up quickly (while dancing). My girlfriend and her friends loved her and have never seen someone have so much fun at work I'll mosdef be going back to her when I go back this weekend.
