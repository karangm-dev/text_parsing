Valentines 2/14/11This is the casino we stopped into right next to the rainbow casino in downtown Henderson. Again it is just a small smokey dive, a little bigger than the rainbow casino. The staff here was rude but the beer was only $1 so it evens out.Not much to see but might check out their mexican cantina at some point.
