The Turnhouse Grille has what a lot of restaurants in Charlotte are missing... personality and memorable food! Turnhouse is locally owned and staffed with people who genuinely want to be there to make your experience memorable. John and Katie regularly tend bar and and will amaze you with their creativity, homemade bitters, and signature drinks and Sam is there to greet you with her smile and knowledge of the menu. The food and is simply spectacular and the kitchen staff is spot-on with their creations and presentation. My favorites eats are the Shrimp Burger, The Hef Wings, Salmon BLT, and the Pork Chop. I'd wake up from a coma to eat that Shrimp Burger!!! Simply delicious and friendly place to hang out with friends.
