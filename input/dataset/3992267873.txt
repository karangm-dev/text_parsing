My spouse and I always like to try someplace new on our anniversary (22 years today) so we picked Max's Mukaase. And, boy, are we glad we did! Fantastic food and wonderful conversation with the owner, Max. It's traditional Ghana cuisine. I had the peanut soup with lamb and rice balls, my spouse had the goat soup. We kept eating each other's meals because both were so tasty! They have a catfish pepper soup that'll be on my radar when I go back.
