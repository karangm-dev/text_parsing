all I can say is WOW.  Me and my girlfriend have eaten in just about all the Korean restaurants in town and this is by far the best. Being half Korean I am pretty picky when it comes to the food and let me tell you this does not disappoint and we will be going back tomorrow or Friday. If you love Korean food you cant miss this spot.
