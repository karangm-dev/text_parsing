Bought my first car on my own at this BMW location. I am absolutely in love with my 3 series, but the lack of communication at this particular dealership is next to nothing. I purchased my car a month ago. As a young adult, I was put into a trap where I was paying nearly 14% in interest alone (mind you, I have a well-off credit score). So in comes my mommy to assist me with purchasing this car. I drove it off the lot the same day I went in, process was fast--or so I thought. Just days later I get a call from the finance manager, Jason Abbott, saying I WAS NOT APPROVED on the loan for the car. So you mean to tell me, that you let an 18 year old kid drive a 20,000 dollar car off YOUR lot, without approved financing? Unprofessional, and probably illegal. Today, December 15th, TWENTY-SIX days after I drove the car off the lot, my father (co-signer) and I are signing the same contract papers for the 3rd time. I am not quite sure how these papers have been messed up 2 other times. Jason tried everything in the world to keep my mother from speaking with the General Manager, who, once my mother finally got a hold of him, had no idea about the situation. Jason will ignore your personal cell phone calls to his cell phone, so you will have to call the dealership, request for finance, and then you are able to get ahold of him! By the way, mentioning someone's name in a good review will not get them a better commission! Apparently, this company does not pay their employees commission. Thank you for the beautiful 3 series, but no thank you to the worst service, from any company, ever.Update: just got the 3rd set of paperwork, and the title work from my last car was incorrect. So we will be expecting the 4th set of paperwork sometime next week.
