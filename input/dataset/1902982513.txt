This place is fantastic. The servers are wonderful, the food is delicious, portion sizes are massive, and prices are extremely reasonable. I ordered the Elvis Pancakes & Just A Couple Of Eggs and it made for a great meal - but prepare to bring a box of leftovers home! Looking forward to trying the donuts from the menu next time! I highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for some good Southern comfort food.
