Gave this HT a try after the remodel.  My normal one is the East Blvd location.  Horrible produce selection.  More than one dairy/frozen item was close to expiring.  I picked up a frozen pizza about to expire in 2 days.  I would not have been a happy camper if I took it home and went to enjoy the Home Run Inn goodness a week later and found it was expired.  My purpose of the trip was to restock on Fage yogurt.  I couldn't buy many as they were expiring in 4 days.  I will stick to the East Blvd and Morrocroft locations.  Until Publix opens closer, then I'll give that a try.
