I really wanted to like this place, but was disappointed and probably won't go back.FOOD:I had the boar sausage and he had the risotto.  We also had salads to start.  First off, the salads were hard to eat as the stems of the leaves had not been removed and they impeded the enjoyment of the starter.  Also, it was rather bland.  The main courses were over-salted.  My boar sausage was disappointingly lack-luster when it came to flavour.  The risotto was over-cooked, but other than the salt, it wasn't bad.ATMOSPHERE:Yes, this restaurant is pretty.SERVICE:They accommodated us even though we did not have a reservation.  It seemed like they just tucked us in and hoped the reserved party would come in late.  It worked perfectly for us as we finished up quickly.VALUE:Since we were disappointed with our meal, the restaurant was over-priced for what we experienced.
