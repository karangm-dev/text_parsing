I have been to the salon 3 times, in search of a local place for services.  Each time, I experienced a very uncomfortable and unprofessional experience with the owner/manager, Frank(?).  The first time, he yelled at a customer who came in complaining of a bad past experience.  He threatened to sue her if she didn't get out of his salon.  The second time, he was yelling at his employees, much like a pimp.  The third time, he had an altercation with a city inspector.  I go to spas to get relaxed, and to leave stress behind.  This salon is beautiful and clean, but in need of a manager / owner who is far more "zen" and relaxed.  I will NEVER go back.
