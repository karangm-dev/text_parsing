Ok. You need to know that the best Philly Cheese Steak is actually in Pittsburg.This is the best Cheese Steak I have ever had, and I've had a lot. Order the smoked Gouda cheesteak (it's not on the menu) and prepare for a serious FIO.Next time I'm in Pitts I will be back.Great staff and just a cool, out of the way local bar.
