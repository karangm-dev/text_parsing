Walked in around mid-afternoon on a weekday looking forward to taking family visiting from overseas. Empty seats and booths, asked to wait until another seat to clearout at 3 pm? We were told by rude staff who were ignoring guests entering and saying "we will be with you soon," meanwhile staff mentioned they have to save booths for larger group than 3. Ridiculous to watch an empty restaurant so busy pleasing the owner with one other person sitting in a booth apparently  "intended for 3 people only," set the perfect example for poor service. What a shame...won't be going back or consider taking guests...far too many restaurants in this city to be treated with utter disrespect.
