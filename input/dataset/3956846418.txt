This place was a mess!  I went here for lunch under a reccomendation from a friend...he was not a friend:)  Walking into the restaurant, the atmosphere was very cafeteria like with the white walls and bright lights, I was not feeling it. I did like the fact that this restaurant was owned by Japanese not Korean, this is rare to find in Phoenix:)I remained optimistic, until I looked at the menu.  They had soooo much going on, it was hard to narrow down what there specialty was.  I good restaurant should always have a specialy.After about 15 min of looking at their menu, and the lunch special menu, and the sushi menu, and the special lunch menu board...I ordered...Uni-  Not freshSashimi assorted- Not fresh, cut is very thickTempura- Not crispy, soggyCold Somen noodles- bad texture, over cookedMiso soup- Made from powder, not pasteSushi Rice-  Not badOverall, this place is a no go....why oh why are good sushi/japanese restaurants so limited in Phoenix?!?
