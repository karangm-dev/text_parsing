I first visited Something White four years ago when my sister was a bride. We drove down to Hudson, Ohio from Michigan to visit a boutique that had the dress she was looking for. When we arrived, they told us the dress wasn't there (despite having called just a couple hours before and they said they were holding it). My poor sister was devastated, and understandably stressed and unhappy. We did a quick Google search for other boutiques in the area, and Something White came up. The designer she wanted was in their shop, however, we noticed it was closing in 20 minutes and we were about a 15 minute drive away.So my sister called them, explained the situation, and without any hesitation they said they would stay open so she could try dresses on. WOW. We were already impressed with them!Once we got there, we immediately felt comfortable. It has a homey feel thanks to the decor and the owners. They make it such a personal and wonderful experience. Thanks to them, my sister was able to find her dream dress!Cut to four years later, and it was my turn! We knew we wanted to go back to Something White thanks to the experience we had with my sister. It was so exciting and surreal to be the bride this time, and their dress selection was a dream. I tried on about 7 dresses, and they were very respectful of my budget while helping me pick out the dresses. They made this experience so stress free, comfortable, and FUN! When it was my sister's turn, my mom and sister celebrated with champagne while I sipped on sparkling grapejuice (I wasn't 21 yet!). It was a very exciting moment this past June when we ALL got to drink the champagne. :)Thank you ladies!! My future daughter(s) will definitely be carrying on this Michigan-to-Ohio-Just-For-Something-White dress tradition!
