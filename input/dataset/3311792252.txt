This is my 2nd time using Bathfitter they are a bit pricey, but they stand by their work and it's so much better than dealing with fly by night contractors. First job was a tub enclosure over my hideous tiles, the second in my new home was ripping out an ugly acrylic tub and enclosure and replacing it with a shower and enclosure. It looks great and I love it!
