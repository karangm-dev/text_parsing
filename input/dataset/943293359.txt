Pure Pizza is a 7th street market staple and rightfully so!! It is delicious. The person taking my order was friendly and the other staff seemed the same way. My order came out quickly (even though it was during lunch rush: ~1 pm); I ordered takeout and it took less than 10 minutes!As for the pizza itself, it is amazing! I got the Margherita this time (though all their specialty pizzas look delicious... mmm). It's your basic tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil, but Pure Pizza does it so well! The mozzarella and basil are fresh and everything works so well together. The tomato sauce is bursting with flavor, but doesn't overpower the basil and cheese. The dipping oil on the side was a nice touch, too.I love how Pure Pizza supports local causes, too! That gets 5 stars in my book! To sum it up, I can't wait to come back to Pure Pizza and try another pizza. 5 stars all around!
