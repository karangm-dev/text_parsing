We got three price quotes from three different companies to transform our desert, dirt-filled yard into a backyard oasis. Our vision included a pool, spa, waterfalls, turf, plants, flowers, rocks and trees. Laguna was the middle price, but by far the most professional. Terrence gets you started with a 3D computer design that allows you to visualize your completed yard in full color detail. He's experienced and knowledgeable and doesn't make you feel bad when you ask him to make changes. George oversees the actual step-by-step construction of the pool and makes sure that everything is up to code and will pass inspection in an efficient and timely manner. Adam takes you to the nursery to hand select your plants, flowers and trees. Then he oversees that the landscaping actually looks like the design that was agreed upon. Doug swoops in at the end to ensure that the house is safely child-proofed, the pool gets filled with water, and that the lights, jets, waterfalls and app are all working properly. All of the construction took exactly 9 weeks from start to finish! They delivered on time and on budget. They cleaned up their messes and repaired any damages done to get the equipment in the yard. I truly feel that we made the best decision in choosing to go with Laguna Pools.
