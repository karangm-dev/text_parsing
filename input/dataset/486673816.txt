Terrible service at ticket counter, a friend bought complimentary tickets for me and they would not provide because I was not the same person who purchased them so I had to cancel the order and put them on my credit card.  Employees terribly rude and unhelpful and made me late for show.  The show was good if you can avoid the terrible service issues.
