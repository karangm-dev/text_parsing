Upon needing some adjustments a couple years back, I just picked one of the many places in Waunakee and I will never doubt my decision! Dr. Lee is amazing! She knows so much about the back and body. You move one way, and she knows just where you need to be adjusted.I've been to a few chiropractors before in different areas and none have been this confident in their knowledge, and so good at what they do. I even got my husband to finally get his back looked at by telling him how great she is! He came in and agreed with me. You may wait a little bit after your appointment time some days, but She really is the best!
