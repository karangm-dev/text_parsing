I heard a lot of good comments about the cakes and I am organizing a big event so I thought I would go to the shop to personally see for myself and eventually plan to place an order. Cakes and desserts really looked good based on the pictures I saw. However, when I came to the shop, I felt awkward because the black lady who was assisting me doesn't seem to be interested to listen and was not encouraging. She didn't even introduced herself. I asked if she could recommend any good desserts and she barely answered me even to some of the questions I asked. I asked for quotation of cakes and desserts and she said she doesn't do it and I can just go online to make a message and someone will answer me. I would like to walk out that moment but I don't wanna be rude but she really made me feel uncomfortable. No enthusiasm! Very disappointing of the customer service.
