Authentic Cajun and Italian. What's not to love? Pair that with tasty Thirsty Dog beers on tap and you have a great hidden gem. Russo's is one of those places with a great local feel and a diverse crowd of regulars. They accommodated our group of 7 on a Saturday night quickly and efficiently. As a bonus, there was a very talented guy playing guitar in the bar area. Overall delicious food not found in many other places in Northeast Ohio, great atmosphere and located in an area I love.
