Why do people choose any particular food establishment over another? For certain types of food, the answer is "the food", of course. But with most establishments, it's the atmosphere and the service that keeps the regulars coming.It is in these two categories where the Vermont Sandwich Company sets itself apart from its peers.Let's face it...there are only so many things you can do to a sandwich...and none of them are particularly earth shattering. But as soon as you walk into this establishment, you realize that this place isn't like the rest. Their menu is neatly hung above the registers with many of their available concoctions written in colorful chalk. There are neat signs hailing the awesomeness of Vermont (i.e. I L(heart)VERMONT). There are stickers from popular music artists ranging from The Beatles to The Dave Matthews Band. It's quite a sight to behold.Now, even though this place is relatively small, the staff treat it like it's a large restaurant. They take your order, seat you, check on you throughout your meal, the works. Dave has done a great job of selecting a staff who actually care about people.Like I said...a sandwich is typically just a sandwich. But Vermont Sandwich Company has found a way to make you forget that simple fact by welcoming you into their quirky and eclectic home where they treat you like family!
