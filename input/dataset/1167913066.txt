WOW. I WISH I had seen these reviews before I even attempted to do business with them. I made an online reservation the morning of the 4th. Got to the desk, turns out, that even though I was certain I pressed the 4th as the rental day, it booked for the 5th. Small mistake. Either way, the guy said he could just do it right there. But the price went up 20 bucks. I said never mind. He said fine he'd cancel it. THEY STILL CHARGED MY CARD!!!! And even though I NEVER RENTED A CAR THERE, they won't refund my money. So basically, I'm just giving them money for nothing. Who TF can afford that? NEVER renting from them again no matter how cheap it is. And I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU DON'T RENT FROM THEM either.
