When the person who had been cutting my hair mysteriously disappeared and an impending job interview forced me to find somebody new, I called Raw one afternoon and Will gave me an appointment forty-five minutes later.  I was pretty shaggy but I needed to look clean cut and professional.  Will did a fantastic job recommending a new cut that fit my expectations, explaining not only what he thought would look good but also the techniques he would use to make it happen.  He spent the time to make sure it was done right.  I couldn't be more satisfied with the service he provided.
