This place was hopping! Forewarning, there isn't too much parking but the inside makes up for it!The toddler area was perfect for little ones! And it's always toddy, despite the little ones tearing everything apart, thanks to the employees always picking up the toys.The playground is ginormous and adults are allowed to get in too to help their little ones.I had a safety concern, and when I bright it up to one of the employees, it was fixed before we even left!My son is too little for me to really enjoy the massage chairs, nail station, or treadmill. But all the parents using them looked very happy. Totally recommend this place!
