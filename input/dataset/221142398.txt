Came here for a party of about 25 people and although the birthday girl booked a VIP/booth seating area weeks ago, it was given away last minute and we ended up being seated within the open area.Upon arriving, it took a really long time (30 mins) to finally get our drinks. Between getting the drinks and our food, I basically emptied my pint by that time.. And I was sipping conservatively... At that point I was filled with liquid and didn't actually feel too hungry anymoreI ordered the chicken parm - took about another 30 minutes to arrive. Along with that, not everyone's entrees arrived at the same time so some of us were waiting and some of the food got cold.The chicken parm - I should post a picture but I have to say the chicken to pasta ratio was rather off. The chicken parm was probably the size of butterflied whole chicken breast with about a fistful of pasta. Normally I wouldn't have complained if the chicken parm wasn't dry, but it was topped with a tad too little tomato sauce. No complaints with pasta, in fact they even shredded it so I could eat it easier and not make a mess with the tomato sauce.The decor and furnishing just felt like what all stars or puck&wings, St. Louis would have been 4-5 years ago. Old furnishing and even the VIP room looked like a cafeteria.Service was slow and most of the servers seemed very uncoordinated. Best part about coming here for the party was the cake, and we brought that, unfortunately
