WOW! I grew up on meat and lived in Texas and love the taste and texture. I became a vegetarian and always have craved a burger....so my roommate brought me to Green and the Bic WAC IS OUTSTANDING! I can't believe its not meat. The taste was perfect and it had the right texture color and consistency. This is not a vegi garden burger. I love to cook and have no idea how they do this. Just try it and you will be shocked! I opted to remove the middle bun and it was just like a double patty with cheese and toppings. I would never have guessed it was vegan. MUST TRY! The fries were crispy and fresh. I also loved the samosas...much better than my fav indian restaurants...not greesy at all but very crispy!
