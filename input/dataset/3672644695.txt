Best Nail shop I have experienced in a very long time! First off, the staff is extremely polite and accommodating, the shop itself is very big, roomy, wheelchair accessible, and SO CLEAN! And as for the product you pay for, perfect. I had a technician (Damon) who did my nails to perfection. He made sure there was no little knicks, bumps, and that everything was straight. He took his time and you can tell he really cares about the work he provides for his clients! My nails look amazing I've never had a bad experience here, and I'm very happy to say this is my Go-to nail shop!!! And PS: the prices are great!
