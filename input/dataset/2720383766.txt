This is a hidden jewel in Las Vegas. Food and service are always amazing, clean family run restaurant with great argentine's music. The restaurant caters to soccer games and has imported argentine products. The best parillada in our city. A beef lovers corner. Great for a family reunion or for a romantic night. The food is outstanding.
