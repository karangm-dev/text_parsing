First observation...this place is cute!  Open to the casino, but still felt intimate.  Great light and design.  Second observation....the entire staff was smokin' hot!  Especially the guy with the badass stache.  5 stars for the eye candy.3 of us stopped in for lunch.  I had the "BLT" that had pork belly instead of bacon and avocado instead of mayo.  It was yummy yummy!  Pork belly was tender and perfectly seasoned.  It was hard to eat and totally sucked when I had avocado and pork belly hanging out of my mouth when hot stache guy walked by.  My friends shared the vegetable chopped salad and a pizza.  They were stoked as well. So 5 stars for eye candy + 6 thumbs up  = as many stars as yelp will allow me to give. If I can recover from the recent trip and make it back to Vegas, this place will be on the itinerary.
