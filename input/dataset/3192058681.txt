Thank you Anne Chau for doing my nails all these years. She started doing nails for me ever since she worked in the other nail salon until now in a hair salon. She is really nice and funny. She takes her time making sure everything is pretty. She also has a lot of nails designs you can pick from. Or you can show her which design you want and she will make it like so. Not to mention her price is cheaper than any other places. What's even greater is you can do nails and your hair all in one place, even better if you are Hispanics because everyone in there speaks Spanish beside Anne as she can speak both Chinese and Vietnamese. Don't hesistate anymore and let her do your nails now!
