We came to Charlotte mostly to eat at this restaurant, which we did for dinner and brunch. Dinner has a bunch of healthy, lower-carb vegan options (plus less-healthy desserts, but I do not regret the ice cream sandwich!). Brunch consists more of hearty Southern options but was very good. Highly recommend the cinnamon rolls as an app! Good service and the patio is dog-friendly.
