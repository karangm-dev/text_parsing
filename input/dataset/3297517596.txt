I am so disappointed with my experience at Drai's tonight. I was refused entry and service for the prescription medication I had in my purse for a medical condition. I was judged immediately, and given no opportunity to explain my health reasons. I am Registered Nurse who understand compassion and the necessity for interventions when prescribed by a healthcare provider. The manger of the establishment confiscated my written prescription medication, and withheld my property. I visualized multiple other medications in his jacket pocket. I question the integrity of these actions and will pursue further actions with law enforcement. Do not give business to a place with these despicable standards and service.
