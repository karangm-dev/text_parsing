Checked in through their website for a haircut while on a layover.  Got a text saying to be at the shop in 6 minutes.  Rushed over from my hotel and when I got there was told it would be at least 30 more minutes.  Was also told that the check-in system doesn't give accurate times.The chairs in the shop were all empty and there were 3 girls standing around when I was told this...Wasted my time and didn't get a haircut.Next time, I'll go somewhere else.
