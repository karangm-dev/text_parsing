Rich and his crew did an amazing job with my move this past Saturday. Had a 11x16 storage room that needed to be moved to our new home. They had everything loaded into my 17 foot truck within 40 min and we were on our way. There were at least 5 pieces of furniture that needed to be taken upstairs and were very heavy. They took care of it with no issues. The rest of the boxes and bins were carefully stacked in our garage. All of this was done within 2 hours. I couldn't be more happier with them and their service. I hope I do not have to move for a long time but if I do, Big Boys Moving is the only company I will be calling for help. Thanks again to Rich and his team.
