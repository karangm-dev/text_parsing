Holy crap I am never doing this airline again! I know with budget airlines, you get what you pay for but this airline is beyond terrible and needs a lot of improvement. There are fees tacked on for everything and you have to be careful with what you are doing. This is my first time taking Allegiant and usually we take United Airlines. My mother and I took Allegiant to Las Vegas from Colorado Springs and we weren't expecting much after reading all of the other reviews. My disabled mother was not able to get her carry on into the overhead bins and asked a flight attendant for help. The flight attendant's response was to "do it yourself". Flight attendants are supposed to help those in need! Our flight was late leaving the gate, seats would not recline on the MD-80, they did an inflight beverage service but charged for every damn thing you would normally get for free such as orange juice and water. There wasn't any snacks, speakers were way too loud and we had an even crappier experience at the Las Vegas airport. We bought the shuttle thing to take us to and from the airport for about $30. People around us said they got it for $12. Our paper said nothing about the shuttle, where we were supposed to go, what shuttle looks like, etc. We waited a very long time for the shuttle! We were told by one of the employees that we were going to the Hilton Elara and to get into line 2, he later told us the bus was approaching and to go to line 1. The driver looked at our papers and told us we were in the wrong line and line 2 is the one we want. Very aggravating that so much went wrong with everything that had to do with Allegiant. I might do a budget airline again but never Allegiant, they are so disorganized and rude. They don't know what good customer service is, and I am warning everyone I know about them!
