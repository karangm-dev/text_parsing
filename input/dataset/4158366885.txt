We had just arrived in Charlotte and it was late at night. We were looking for a place with 1) TVs to watch the unfortunate game on Sunday night and 2) good food.Dandelion Market was perfect for what we needed. The waitress misled us a little bit and told us to order 2-3 items per person. We definitely ended up with too much food. Here are some of the items we sampled:-Mediterranean Trio-Prosciutto Crostini-Pan Seared Scallops-Cherry Glazed Lamb Lollipops-Grilled Chicken Wings-Market Mac & Cheese-Pomme Frites-Dando Brussel Sprouts-Grilled Steak Sliders-PEI Mussels-Beet SaladOverall, everything was good. The Prosciutto Crostini was the weakest link. We really loved the fries. We were beyond stuffed (5 of us total) and had some leftovers. If you go, I would recommend that you order at most 2 items per person to start.
