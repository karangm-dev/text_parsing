My wife and son are picking up his car at Ewing Bros right now because he had gotten into a car accident a few days ago.  Apparently the lady there is ripping them off and saying she did not know the car was not drivable so they are charging EXTRA.  Are you really that ignorant lady?  It doesn't take a genius to see that it's completely totalled!  Furthemore, they are absolutely rude.  They remind me of Stoneridge Towing in Hawaii.  They all should be shut down!  Mahalo for allowing me to warn more people about your work ethics.
