Warning! Do not patronise this location. The staff are super shady. They went out to "inspect the car" after we returned it and mysterious fender damage appeared when she came back in. They did this because we refused to pay for their company insurance (as we had our own). In order to ding our personal insurance policy, they busted the front fender while we sat inside the office. When we complained that no damage was there when we returned it, the manager (literally) smirked and said "well, we told you to get our insurance. You refused."$350 deductible later.... and this was supposed to be all covered because of a no-fault accident. Money grabbers and scam artists is all they are.
