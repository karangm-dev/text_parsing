This is scam. I call the company to fix my refrigerator because it can't produce ice and water leak. What I do is unplugged the hose at the back to stop the leak. Then I callthen I message this company to check the problem and I talk to the owner then he charge me 79.00 to chk if there is a problem he change part with my expense. I said fine. He show up in my house by 2pm I'm not home my wife is the one who talk to him. He put back the hose and turn on the water that's all he do then left. When I came home the ice maker still not working Of course because he don't do anything so I message back the owner about the problem he said . I saw the hose is not connected and the water is off maybe reason why there is no ice I said I'll take it out then you just put it back then charge me 79.00 to put it back? He don't even chk the problem. I message him and he don't answer me again he just ignore me. Please remember this company don't ever call this. Don't be a victim.
