I called this place of business a week before to set up a tour & schedule an appointment for day camp. I was not told my furbaby needed to have the canine influenza vaccination until after I arrived. I needed services the following week. I didn't appreciate their lack of professionalism. Thanks to PetSmart Cotswold location in Charlotte for accommodating us & taking great care of my baby!
