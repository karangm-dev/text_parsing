Terrible!  We have been going to Peachtree since it opened.  It was always great food and good atmosphere, But something has changed.  The food was bland and well, just bland. The deviled egg app used to be fabulous and now tastes like prepacked Sysco food.  And the clientele is now loud drunks that camp out all evening and ruin a nice place.  Small restaurants should decide if they are a bar or a foodie place.  Peachtree is now a bad mix of both.  I will no longer recommend it.  Too bad.
