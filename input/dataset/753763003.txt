Super great!!! Pretty food !!! Delicious!!! Friendly, excellent service.We ordered several items and everything was delicious. We took it to go. Restaurant is small but clean.  Eat in or take out.We've lived in Las Vegas almost 8 years. Have tried all the Japanese and sushi places with no rave reviews........... and FINALLY we find Mom's Teriyaki, a friend's referral. Originally from Hawaii then SOCAL, we had no issues finding good food. Different story in Las Vegas. A lot of misses, no hits. Mom's Teriyaki is a 5-STAR HIT! We will be going again and again!
