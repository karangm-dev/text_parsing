So my parents got me a beautiful Australian cattle dog in December for Christmas. Of course, my mom went here to see which dog she wanted before bringing it home. Of the three ACD puppies left (1 boy and 2 girls), she picked the calmest puppy, a girl. She took some pictures of her to send to my dad, like, "This is the one!" She left, and then sent my dad to go pick her up a few days later. As much as I love my baby, they gave us the WRONG BABY! Looking at the pictures back in December, they clearly had different face and head designs. My baby was already bought by someone else, which is why my mom was looking at the other calmer girl. It was the staff's mistake and they should be more detail-oriented.
