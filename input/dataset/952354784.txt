Don't order pics online for 1 hour photos, cuz it's not 1 hour!  Better yet u will get there & they won't even have a record of ur order!  I ordered online 3xs.  The first time the order went to an east coast location that I used to go to 3 yrs ago!  That's another thing the website is faulty & ur current location does not save automatically as default.  This happened to me too before!!!  Anyhow, I get a call saying my pics r ready 4 pick up & I Learn they r in PA!  So I asked them to mail it, they said no they can't they will shred them & I can call walmart.com 4 refund!  When I call they have no record of the order!  So I say ok I just lost  a few bucks no big deal.  I place order 2 & never get a call or any kind of notification that order is ready!  So I place order 3 just in case I never actually placed the order.  I get to the 1 hour dept 2 find out yet again my pics are not there & no record of my order!!!! So I had to place a 4th order just to get my pics!!! This Time though it was on walmart!!!! No I have to fight w Walmart.com for a refund!  They just keep saying there's no record of my order!!!So if u don't want any grief people & simply just want to order pics without any complications don't do it @ Walmart arroyo crossing in LV NV!!!!
