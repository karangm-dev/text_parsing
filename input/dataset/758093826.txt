Very disappointed!  Had a blow out on our fifth wheel about 15 miles out of Boulder City. Pulled I to RV park and told the gal why we were late and she Highly recommended Ralph's said he would get us in and out and on our way. Fast forward to next morning get to Ralph's and he didn't even have time to see if he had the tire
