One Saturday I sat at the bar for lunch. There was no wait to sit there (or in the dining room for that matter) and as soon as we sat down the bartender approached and welcomed us. We ordered our food and afterwards the bartender specifically asked us if we wanted bread. We said yes...but bread never came. We ordered the appetizer Chicken Lettuce Wrap Tacos and chose the Asian style. The lettuce leaves were large enough to hold all the fillings successfully. They were filled with grilled chicken and then you could pick one of two types of flavors. We chose Asian which included carrots, bean sprouts, cucumber, cilantro and rice noodles. One spicy cashew and one sweet cilantro sauce came with it. These were good. For my main I ordered the lunch portion of the Shepherd's Pie. I'm not opposed to non traditional SPs, I love them in fact, but this one wasn't good. Mashed potatoes were placed on top, but not covering the entire top and not baked on. Peas, carrots, zucchini and onions were mixed in the mushroom gravy below the potatoes. The mushroom gravy flavor was noticeable. This was all good. The meat however, was not ground beef as the menu description simply indicated. The meat was a broken apart flame-grilled hamburger. I could clearly taste the flame grilled aspect of the meat. The meat was also not in crumbles, but was in chunks as if literally a hamburger had been grilled and ripped apart. Between the flavor and the texture of the meat the dish was ruined.
