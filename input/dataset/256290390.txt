I had heard that this place has very good breakfast with quality ingredients and low prices. However, my husband is not a breakfast person so if you go at dinner time breakfast is still available which is something I need to remember. We went on a Friday after a long stressful week where we had our wedding coming up a week later  and it provided comfort food for us, typically not what we would normally have but it hit the spot. I had the fried chicken and waffles so a little dinner and breakfast in one and my husband had the smaller chicken fried steak. The portions were large. The service was very good and the food came out hot and quick. The decor is very cute. It looks like you are in a cozy cabin. I will def be going back for my comfort food fix!
