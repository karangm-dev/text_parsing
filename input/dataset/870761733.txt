I was not impressed with this restaurant at all. First, the 2 ladies behind the counter were very rude. The menu didn't include a description of any of the items and they seemed annoyed when I asked what came in 2 of them. I ordered a chicken salad, my husband had the chicken bowl and my kids shared a plate. I had to ask for them to put tomatoes and cucumber in my salad, I guess it comes with just lettuce and chicken? My kids love olives and to get a couple on the chicken plate it costs extra. My husband ordered the bowl and it's strange, there's no rice or anything, just chicken and hummus and chick pea. He decided to buy a side of pita chips but they were stale and disgusting. He immediately took them back. No apology was given, the lady actually looked pissed that he said anything. She gave him fries instead but was really weird about it. None of the food had much flavor and the pita bread was really chewy. I wouldn't be surprised if some of the good reviews are from friends or family of the owners because there was absolutely nothing "4 star" about this place. I would definitely not return. The Great Greek and even Stephano's are a million times better, the staff are polite and the food actually has flavor.
