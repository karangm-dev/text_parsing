I absolutely love everything about this hole in a wall coffee shop. I came here for a meeting but if I lived in the area, this place would definitely be my "second home" for where I'll do my work.The ambience of this coffee shop is super chills and laid back. I love how there's a variety of couches and tables where you can come meet with friends or take your laptop out to do some work--they have free wifi! Prices for the food and drinks are reasonably cheap; I could totally see myself camping out here all day. The staff are super friendly and checked to make sure that my friends and I are having an enjoyable experience. I got a bagel with cream cheese and my friend got a stuffed beef patty, which is a beef patty with lettuce, tomato, and cheese--what a way to dress up such a common snack!!If you're in this area, you've gotta come here!! You won't regret it!
