The owner does amazing work and is super sweet! I've been going to her for years on and off. My brother even goes to her! She does great work and she's very thorough. Idk if it's a different string that she uses, but it's wayyyy less painful than other places and my eyebrows look great and stay that way for 2 or 3 weeks!! I love that there's hardly ever a wait to be seen too. Highly highly recommend going here! And I love to support local businesses and this lady is top notch! If you want less pain and more beauty, you've found it!!
