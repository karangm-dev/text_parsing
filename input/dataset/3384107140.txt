I know everyone has their favorites in pizza choices and flavor, but the pizza my friend and I ordered here after a concert evening out, was just plain horrible. In all honesty, Little Caesars $5.00 pizza would have been SOOOO much better! We sat at the bar, and the place was pretty packed after a recent concert and it was happy hour as well. Service was actually really quick. All staff was friendly.  We went with a margarita pie because it was 50% off...and now I know why.  I am not a fan of thin crust. I don't like picking up what seems like a tortilla and having all the toppings fold over. Being a margarita pizza, obviously there are not many toppings on it.  The sauce was rancid. It was like they took a can of tomato paste and slathered it all over the tortilla like crust.  Cheese was good, as was the fresh chopped basil, but what a waste of good toppings on a crappy crust and sauce.  I never liked the thin crust/tortilla like crusts that PT's group has. Especially if you're not there for happy hour when they're 50% off, you're paying full price for something that should cost $5-$8 given the size and thickness of the pizza. Lackluster.  Sorry....
