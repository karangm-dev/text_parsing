Great atmosphere. Inviting and friendly decor and staff but the food..it's okay... A bit overpriced. The place looks great and is a welcome addition to the St. Clair W strip but not the best value for your money. The line-ups on the weekend tell you that the area is desperate for a good place though. They should watch their back at Boom, because someone else with a little flair and better value could steal that line easily.
