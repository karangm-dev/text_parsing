I can honestly say that I've never had a really good hair style until I came to Alis.  She took the time to talk to me about what I liked and disliked about my hair and the difficulties I've had with getting a good haircut.  She explained to me why my hair was difficult to cut and style and why I haven't been satisfied with my past results.  Besides receiving the best cut I've ever had, she educated me about the right products to use and how to achieve the look that I want.  Alis is a dedicated professional; she loves being a hair stylist and it shows in her work.  Don't hesitate on making an appointment with Alis - you will love her work!
