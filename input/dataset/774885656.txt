Awesome place.  If you love seafood and you really can inhale the stuff this is the place to go.  Huge selection of cold and hot seafood.  What is notable is that they have sashimi and the sushi they have isn't half bad and isn't stale like other buffets.  They a course have crab lets, oysters, clams, etc.  But the big game changer is the lobster tales.  They aren't New England tails (Brazilian or Mexican) but none the less a bargain for the price of admission.  The desserts are okay but I am not a hug dessert guy.  Overall if you love seafood this is the place.
