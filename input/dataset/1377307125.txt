I haven't seen the PA I was supposed to have the appointment with yet. My appointment was at 3:45 and I am still sitting in the waiting room at 5pm. I have seen huge groups of people come and go, most of them walk ins with no appointment at all and still I wait. Deciding whether it is worth it to stay or if I should just leave since once I get called back it will be even more waiting. I already paid though so I suppose I am stuck for now. Oh look, someone else who just walked through the door five minutes ago just got taken back to see the doctor. I have checked with the receptionist twice and keep being told they are going to call me "any minute now." Oh look more people that came in after me just finished their appointment and left. My other issue is that if I leave then the only other choice with my crappy insurance is health partners of Nevada and I've heard they are worse. I just heard the receptionist say something about how it is always like this and then she announced to the entire reception area that this wasn't her problem for all of us waiting over an hour and we needed to take it up with someone else! This was completely unsolicited and she just said it to the entire room and then left for the day. Now the isn't anyone at reception at all. I'm leaving, this is ridiculous.
