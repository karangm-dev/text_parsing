Always 5 star service! Had the unfortunate experience of a hit and run in an employee casino parking lot. We used LVCC before and I knew I'd only take my car to them because of their stellar reputation and quality of work. It took about 5 days and my car is as good as new. Mark, Mara, Felix - they're all amazing. You can't even tell where the damage was done. They detail your car inside and out, and they even give you a small bottle of paint for touch ups. They even took me home after I dropped off my car. They truly go out of their way in the name of service. Thank you guys, and as I said, love you but I hope I never see you at the shop again.
