It's been a while since we were here so we were looking forward to coming. Apparently two weeks ago they changed their menu and it is nothing like it used to be. We got the clams (so small and no dipping sauce), the sea bass appetizer (again small AND served in a plastic bag), the scallops entree which was so small and has a horrible flavor, and the halibut which was admittedly the best dish of the night. The bartender did not refresh my husband's ice cube when he ordered a second old fashioned but put a second one on top of the previous one (I know this might seem trivial but it just added to the overall poor experience). A couple who sat down next to us seemed equally disappointed in the menu change. Overall it was a terrible night and I hate we spent $175 on a meal we hated and left hungry and went somewhere else to eat. Hopefully they'll revert back to the old menu as the new Japanese fusion menu they're trying leaves a ton to be desired.
