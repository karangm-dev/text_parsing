Having recently moved here, I was having trouble finding a good threading place to go to. So when I found this place, I was pretty stoked. When I got there, there was a chair available right away. One of the ladies invited me to take the seat, but then she continued being on her phone. Not the greatest customer service! Although the process was fairly simple and I was happy with the shape, I noticed that she cut me several times on the skin under my eyebrows. If I return, I will only be going to Farida or her daughter.
