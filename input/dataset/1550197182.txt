I had a great experience at Bright Now dental on Cave Creek Rd. The dentist, I think her name was McDonald was excellent, caring and competent. However, the hygienist was amazing and awesome. You could see right away she was competent & experienced but she was even more caring and compassionate. I will come back again and make them MY dental office. ALEX F
