Not my cup of joe.  The first time I went there the staff was customer service stunt.  The second time i went there the service was plain Jane.  The 3rd time I went there so rude i writ an email and never received a response back.  I live a block from this road hazzard and will gladly drive to LUX for a sure thing.  BIG YAWN to Urban Beans !!!
