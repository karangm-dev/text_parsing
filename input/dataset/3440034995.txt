This review has nothing to do with the actual chiropractic care, which was great. It has everything to do with Lisa and how she handled the billing and contract and subsequent conversations. Long story short, got signed up for their monthly plan using a flex spending account. Was told I could cancel by submitting a written letter to cancel. Used the Joint for a couple months then got busy and didn't use again until I needed to and found out my flex account had been shut off, and the joint kept billing. My flex spending company said they needed itemized receipts to turn the card back on...and Lisa initially refused to print the receipts until she got the $$ for the months that the card was shut off. I explained the situation and asked why I wasn't notified that the card wasn't working and she said she tried calling (she hadn't) but she "is not allowed to leave voicemails" which frankly didn't matter because she never called in the first place. I asked for the franchisee's number and she stated they were corporately owned, and refused to give me their contact info because "they would refer you back to me". I told her I'd find the number myself (which I did). The best part?  She called me and left a couple of voicemails!!If you need to use the joint, don't sign up for their plans...well at least with Lisa.
