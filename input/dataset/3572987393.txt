This restaurant was fantastic! The concept of eating without vision was intriguing. The dinner was filled with laughs and good conversation. We were lead in a line to our table and each person to their seat. This was not just dark but you could not see something right in front of your face. The waiters/waitresses were all blind and allowed us to see how aware you need to be without the vision. Taking away one sense is said to increase your other senses so as taste and hearing which I believed to be true in this experience. The meal was extremely delicious. I had the chicken and it was cooked to perfection. I also had a surprise beer which was a nice surprise. The whole experience was unlike anything I have ever done and I hope this spreads to other cities. A must do!
