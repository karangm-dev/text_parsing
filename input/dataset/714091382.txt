Unlike Hello Bistro, I was not impressed with Delicious Raw.  I've been wanting to try this place out since it opened, and I finally made it over only to be enormously disappointed. The staff was friendly enough, but my smoothy was horrible! I couldn't even finish it, and for $8, I was pretty unhappy about not drinking every last drop.. but I just couldnt. I have a pretty well rounded and cultured taste for food and drink, and I just didn't love.. or even like.. delicious raw.   I'll admit that some of my colleagues have been there a time or two and seem to have a different opinion, but for me, it was a no go, and a never again.
