i just had the worst meal i've ever  had, in my 60 years of dining out. I have come to this place frequently and always had great mexican food but last night i couldnt even finish one of the fish tacos.they forgot to put on the sauce so it was dry. everyting from the beans to the rice to the fish were WAY over salted. the margaritas tasted like water even tho happy hour was over.the staff pretends they dont understand you when you try to complain. they said they would give me my meal for free: which is what the coupon we had was anyway. and they still charged us for the awful drinks and the overly salted sides.its too much work to complain so we just paid and left.This used to be the best mexcian food in town; now with all the new competition opening in the area, they need to stay on top of things.I see it closing in the near future....cant imagine anyone returning to this place.Very sad.....
