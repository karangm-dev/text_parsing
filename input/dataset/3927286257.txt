Yum. Our fav restaurant in Charlotte, now in Fort Mill!  Maybe not as much character as the original location, but I'll settle for close to home and much more space. In our first visit to this location, we had great service and great food. What more could you ask for?  The manager/owner came around to check on tables which is a dying art in restaurants today. They always have wonderful specials, so definitely ask your server. And order the mac n cheese. Best in Charlotte!
