Service was soo poor. People who came in after us ate and left. Another group was half done eating when we inquired about our food. When the waitress came back from checking we were told they just put it on the grill. We told her we were leaving. The last time I ate here the service was slow too. It seems that REGULARS slips get to jump the line. Just saying. Went to Eat N Park from order to food (they were busy too) was 16 minutes.
