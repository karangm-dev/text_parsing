I get you have to keep up with the store theft, but you really have to work on your people. I was shopping with my son and I don't like shopping at all, but your prevention loss guy gave me the creeps. He acted like a child molester/kidnapper rather than a loss prevention guy. I felt like I had to keep an eye on my son and your security because it felt unsafe...work on your security tactics because they really suck right now.
