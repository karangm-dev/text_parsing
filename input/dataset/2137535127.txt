This was my go-to breakfast / bagel place in Charlotte. The first time one of my friends brought me here, I was pretty skeptical based on the exterior, but once I tried the Grubby Bubby I was hooked. I almost always got the Grubby Bubby with veggie cream cheese and it always hit the spot. I had never had a bagel steamed before Owen's and now I wish I could steam every bagel I eat. Lunch sandwiches are also good here; I always tried to pick a random one from the string of construction-paper sandwiches hung above the counter.
