Ordered the Pad Thai and the Crunchy Thai Rolls to go, over the phone. It was ready when I arrived and paid about $15. You get a lot of pad thai for what you pay for, but hardly any flavor. At best I would say it mildly tastes like what I am used to. Somewhat disappointed that by the time I got back to my office the noodles were all stuck together and the sauce was at the bottom.However the rolls were extremely delicious. You get 5 rolls, I was only expecting 3. I might come back in the future. The Avocado Curry looks intriguing. I would not recommend this to a friend.
