We love this pizza.  Went there today and ordered a Soho salad pizza. It was ordered with no tomatoes or almonds. It was brought out with almonds and tomatoes by a gentleman we later learned was the manager. We expressed to him that we had asked for no almonds or tomatoes and apologized and took it back.  The Soho comes back with our waitress with tomatoes. We again expressed to her that we did not want tomatoes and she says she will get the manager and leaves it on the table.  Several minutes go by and the manager came out and apologized and said he had a large catering order on the phone and neglected to tell the kitchen no tomatoes.  He took it back and a short time it came out for the third time correctly.  Considering all the issues one would have expected the Soho to be comp'd. When we got the bill it was still on there.  We paid the bill and expressed to the waitress that it was disappointing that we were still charged for the Soho when it took 3 times to get it correct.  She told us that she thought the manager would have taken it off but he didn't and she apologized. The whole point of having dinner together is to eat together.  Because of the issues this didn't happen as my pizza would have been cold.  Bummer experience all around.  Returned today for take out.  Pizza was good and made just like we ordered.  We are very satisfied with this visit and the excellent food!!!
