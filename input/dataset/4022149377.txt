This place is nothing more than really Americanized and not so good Asian food.  Fusion--ha!  If you mix crap with crap you still have crap.I had the duck with plum sauce--greasy with mushy skin (should be crispy).  Plum sauce was essentially flavorless duck sauce (not sauce for duck, but that sweet apricot sauce that comes in those little packets).  Served with stale rice without any aromatics.  Heck, minute rice has more flavor.  If the food was even 1/2 as good as frozen Chinese food from my grocery store, then the price would still be too high.  Only plus was that our server was friendly.  Hard Rock--give this place a hard kick out of your casino!
