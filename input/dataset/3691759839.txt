Hmmmm. Well we waited forever to get our food. Not sure if it's any good but after an hour wait on a not so busy day, the only activity we saw that was quick was getting our check after we complained about the wait. What a shame. Doubt I will be back. Service was awful.Still can't believe the manager allowed us to walk out of there without trying to make amends.
