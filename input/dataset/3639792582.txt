Hopefully this help new comers. You order by selecting either lomein noodle or fried rice. Then choose either 2 or 3 sides. Typical chinese express. We ordered half lomein half frice rice + 2 sides + apple juice for $12. Pretty cheap in vegas strip standard. However the food does taste cheap as well.
