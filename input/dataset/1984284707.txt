It makes me very sad that the management here does not care about the tenants. More importantly the ones that are not on drugs, selling them, or doing any other crimes. Just work and come home. The only thing that I ask is to just have a place that works properly. Instead when something is broken I am spoken to like a dog, bullied, and threatened. This is why there is so much crime here. A man was murdered in my building yet I am threatened by management. They lie about the problems that need to be fixed. They are full of excuses and pass the buck to someone else. It is horrible that I will never feel safe or feel at ease here. This place needs to wipe out the staff and start over. Horrible.
