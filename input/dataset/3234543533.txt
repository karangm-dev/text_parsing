Its a little bit expensive but its definitely worth it! When u sit outside u have a great view of the Bellagio Fountains.Only tried the Sugar Factory burger and a Pizza but they are really tasty, one of the best burgers I ever had actually, but be aware of ordering extra bacon on the burger, I had to pay $4 for 2 tiny pieces of bacon. The fries that comes with are also above average.Also tried the sorbé, the coconut sorbé is a killer! Sooo good and creamy, almost like real ice cream. The raspberry sorbé wasn't as good but still very nice for a sorbé.
