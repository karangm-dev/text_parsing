Forced to use them again because of Fidelity Home warranty company. Once again they came and "fixed" the problem. Only to return again and fix the problem.  They removed a part (that could have stayed in) and made the unit not work at all saying they would "be right back". They never came back and we spent the day/night with no AC...summer...in Vegas.
