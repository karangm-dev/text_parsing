This place is eye candy.....but that's where it stopped. Tried to dine here after a show and unfortunately the snarky hostess pi$$ed me off so much,we just moved along. Where do they get these juvenile acting brats when there are so many great people looking for employment? Time for a tude change and it won't be on my dime.
