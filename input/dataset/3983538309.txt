This is actually my friends & my favorite place in town. Even when I was living on the east coast I would still come to this place every time I came to visit! The bar/ waitstaff are always so great and  are very accommodating/ patient rockstars. The food is great, I think I've tried almost everything on the menu (for starters, get the trio). They have a great beer (they have this amazing Mother Earth Cali creamin ale on draft right now) and spirit selection. It's really convenient too, usually ample parking across the street and it's right on the light rail!! Dj Matt in the Hat is also there every Tuesday so you have to check out their awesome taco Tuesday specials!
