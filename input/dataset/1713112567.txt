Open dining area with the bar on one side. Flat-screen tv's adorn the walls. The atmosphere isn't great, but they make do with what they have. Our waitress was prompt and friendly. Decent, but not great beer selection, although seeing Moosehead and Magic Hat was nice. I ordered the N'awlins Burgher, which the menu described as cajun-seasoned with chipotle mayonnaise, bleu cheese, bacon, lettuce, and tomato. The seasonings were barely noticeable, the bleu cheese had little flavor, and the buns were almost but not quite as good as week-old Town Talk sandwich bread. The burger wasn't bad, but for a supposed gourmet burger restaurant, I wanted it to be a lot better than it was.The fresh-cut fries, however, were bad. They were colder than room temperature and relatively tasteless. Drowning them in Frank's Red Hot did little to improve them. I ate about 1/4 of them. Overall, Bubba's was disappointing. Again, it isn't bad, and the prices are reasonable. The problem, though, is that there are many, many other places with better burgers and significantly better fries. I don't regret eating here, but I don't need to ever go back.
