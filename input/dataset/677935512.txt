I had previously been a member of Equinox in the States so I was excited when I learned they were coming to Toronto. The recently opened Bay Street location has not disappointed. Fantastic facility, friendly staff, state-of-the art equipment and top-notch classes like Endurance Cycle with Jacabo. Well done, Equinox. Welcome to Toronto.
