** This review is not based on food.** We didn't get to make it to the food. We pulled up, it was a very small place set back off the road. No one was there on a Saturday night except for us. The workers were all sitting in the front looking bored like it was closing time. It was weird and I felt uncomfortable and didn't want to enter. I didn't want it to be an awkward situation. We ended up just ordering food from somewhere else. Poor first impression, not sure we will try it out.
