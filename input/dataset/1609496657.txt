I felt lazy to drive to a better place to eat, but since it was next door I came here. The staff isnt the friendlyest and the food reflects it. They are very cheap on the amount of meats they put on the sandwich. You get more at Subway, if you want to compare. Also, for what they charge your better off going to another place. If you want a really good sub sandwich, go to Jimmy Johns. They have much better service, food and always have a friendly greeting when entering or leaving there.
