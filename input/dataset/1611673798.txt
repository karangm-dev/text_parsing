So dissapointed by my recent visit to this location. I brought my boyfriend here for his birthday. I had reservations and noted to them that it was his birthday. We arrived 10 minutes early and were informed our table wasnt quite ready and were seated at the bar to wait. 30 minutes later we were finally seated. Another 10 minutes later we were finally acknowledged. As i looked around i noticed another table was celebrating a birthday and had received a box of truffles with a candle in it. Nice touch! Ordered our meal. I got the filet and my bf ordered swordfish. Our meals came. The filet was medium well instead of medium and was still ok, but not as I had ordered. The swordfish was so tasteless and bland that my boyfriend took two bites and left it. We shared my over done steak. The waitress never checked on us until my plate was cleared. When she finally asked if he had a problem with the fish he explained that it was very bland. The waitress then told us it wasnt her favorite dish either and then scolded us for not flagging her down and telling her earlier!! Whaa? I should have flagged you down??? How about you check on us? The swordfish was taken off our bill in the end with an apology from a manager and a 25 dollar gift card. Birthday truffles? Nope!...will not be going back to this Flemings any time soon. Not even to use the gift card.  In a city full of such fantastic food and service this restaurant cant afford to make people wait long times for reserved tables, serve bland food along with mediocre service at 4 star prices.
