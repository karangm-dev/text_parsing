I think that Barhop Peter St definitely deserves 5 stars, and let me tell you why...First: The service... Whether it's Jamie who meets and greets you at the door, or Devin or Krista or any of the other lovely people that work there to take care of you, everyone is on point! Second: The beer... The selection is incredible! They've got something for everyone... Even if you don't drink beer, there's a beer for you. I love beer, but there is this one that they carry, Redline Leather Interior Vanilla Almond Brown Ale... Can't find it anywhere else and it makes me lose my $#!+ when I see it on the rotating menu... Definitely worth checking out!Third: THE FOOD!! Do yourself a favor and get the Venison Tartare. You'll be really glad you did!!!!Fourth: The value! You get a lot without having to pay a lot. Food portions are great and you can drink craft beer without paying insane craft beer prices! Check this place out and have a great time! You may have to wait depending on when you go... But it's totally worth it!
