This company has the WORST customer service EVER!  - they put you on LONG hold times (up to 18 minutes), they take a LONG time to refund your money (40 days), you have no way to reach the Corporate Office.  I finally had to go through the BBB to get results.  The Whole Chain just isn't worth your time and money.
