Wow, this place is amazing.  Fast and efficient for only $13 for a women's haircut.  Just be aware that everything is ala carte.  So if you want a wash, you pay for it.  Also, if you make an appointment your are guaranteed that time slot.  This is my second time there.  I go to Kat.  She is amazing!  She cuts my hair is a beautiful way while also doing is quickly.  I'm in and out in 30 min.  I'd recommend this place for sure!
