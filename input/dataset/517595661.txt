Mark was great. Very helpful in our process to secure a home, especially given we are from out of state. We appreciated his patience and willingness to accommodate our needs. We most appreciate the high level of professionalism and open communicate and dialogue. We really felt he understood what type of home we wanted. We would absolutely recommend Mark to our family and friends who are interested in purchasing a home in our area.
