Funny enough, the plates are often off putting at this particular location of Milestone's. There is always something fishy with the food and I'm not too keen of the venue so I prefer going with friends to the one on Yonge & Sheppard which seems to bring in a livelier crowd because for its bar type feel. If that is what you're looking for, check out 5095 Yonge st.
