We were greeted at the door with a smile and seated immediately.  Drink orders were taken and delivered.  The menu was lovely, I ordered oysters and the hunter's rabbit.  Kids ordered bison burgers and frites, husband hot salmon tartar and the veal shank.  The food was really delicious... my oysters were served with a mignonette and the rabbit had a delicious brown sauce were carmelized carrots.  Kids loved their food, one had it plain, one with everything, both were perfectly cooked.  Husband's veal and spaetzle was terrific.  The kids got the chocolate mousse with hazelnuts...they cleaned the dishes.  I had a glass of Pinot noir and my husband had the Kissmeyer Nordic pale ale, which he adored.  The service was on point and we had a spectacular experience.  Thank you for making us feel so welcome on our first night in Montreal!!
