Ive seen pretty much every show in las vegas. From the crappiest one where I wanted to hang myself or go "Michael Meyers" on the cast, to the best one where I can go back again , again and again.Love is spectacular. Not only because it's a cirque show, but because the vibe it gives you. You leave the show happy, thinking you can actually change the world (of course this spell goes away as soon as you hit the tables and get a couple scotchs on the rocks).The theater is very nice. Everyone that works is dressed up to match with the show. Everyone is wearing some kind of old school british outfit. One thing I don't understand is why people rush through the doors. The place is seat assigned and it doesn't matter if you get there 20 minutes early or right on time. Seriously it reminds me of the lion king scene where mufasa dies. Weird how people still do this nowayds isn't it?When the show starts you inmediatly get summerged in the whole experience. As usual when you go to a ciruqe show, keep your eyes wide open and look all around you as things are happeing all over the place. But the main story is in the center of course. This accompanied with the best beatles songs gives the show a feeling. First its sad, then funny, then love(no pun intended), then war, thenhate, etc I meanhonestly you are in a trip through England since the beginning of the last century. The music makes it extra special.Tickets are not cheap, but you can sometimes find some good deals online. But even if you pay full priceit totally worth it. The cirque experience is a magnificent one and if you are a beatles fan this is definetly the show for you. Ive seen the show plenty of times and can tell you that it made me feel good every single one of them.So all you need is LOVE......and money to buy the tickets ..then you ll be all set..
