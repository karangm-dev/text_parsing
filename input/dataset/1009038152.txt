Best brunch ever! We showed up at 11 so the wait for a table was crazy long but the hostess sat our group of 4 at one of the cozy couches in the bar and helped us scope out who was leaving soon to snag their chairs. We tried the wedge salad (amazing) and the biscuit special which had fried chicken, bacon, eggs and sausage gravy. So rich, I recommend splitting it. The granola parfait was delish.
