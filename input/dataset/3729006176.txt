Absolutely terrible company!!  Do not do business with them!!  They were over 2 hours late from our appointment time!  Then they did not clean what I asked them to, I found all 3 of them in one bathroom milling around.  Half ass job all the way around, I posted a review stating as such, they replied that they'd come back for free to do the job correctly and then I never heard from again!  I believe and hope they are now out of business, hardly surprising!
