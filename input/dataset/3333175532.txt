Very disappointed in the BBQ tonight. I've eaten at the location in Cary, NC and Raleigh, NC. Both of those were far better than here. Pulled pork was sooooo dry. Brisket wasn't bad but Midwood has much better brisket. Ribs were way over cooked. All the sauces tasted like the molasses had been burnt. Tried 3 sauces and all tasted burnt. Baked beans were burnt tasting also. Overall it was bad. Midwood has much better brisket and Off the Hoof BBQ has the best ribs hands down.
