Blue 32 is my families favorite restaurant to go to. We meet friends there, we meet family there, and everyone that we have taken with us has loved it as well. I've read through some of the other reviews and if they gave less than 5 stars they are not eating at the same restaurant as me. The prices are moderate, the food always tastes the same no matter who is cooking, good. The food is flavorful and I've ordered many different items on the menu and they are all delicious. The happy hour is amazing. Sundays during football season are a little crowded but that is to be expected, and it is not because it is full of "homeless" people like one of the reviews by Anthony stated. It is full of people drinking, eating, watching football and having an amazing time. If you have never tried Blue 32 it needs to be on your places to go.
