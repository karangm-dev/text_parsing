Words cannot describe how lucky we were to work with Jorge Quijada! We highly recommend him to anyone in search of a real estate agent. We were guided the whole way through this crazy process with such professionalism, promptness and care.He takes time to get to know you and what you're looking for, even if you don't know yourself. Jorge is responsive, professional, smart, and has has kept in touch after the sale to make sure everything is going well.  That says a lot about the kind of person he is -- he's about finding the right fit for the buyer, not just making a sale and moving on.
