I just went to this Sugar Factory location, we had the greatest service from Misti and we have been to a bunch of locations. She was very helpful with our hangover in a fish bowl. Berry was a good choice. Food tasted fresh and came out in perfect time and temperature. White pizza was one of the best I've had and my wife's alfredo was tasty as well. I will definitely be back to this location managers were also great and willing to help with servers tables as well. Nice to see a restaurant having their S*** together! Great place for nice date night.
