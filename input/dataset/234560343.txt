My wife and I came here on Monday as new patients for our annual cleanings/check ups.  I found this place on Yelp and loved the reviews so decided to give him a try. From the moment we walked in we were greeted and checking in went smoothly.  The staff is awesome. Super friendly. Totally making us feel comfortable.  I am very pleased and will definitely be my place for dentistry. Thanks Desert Smiles!
