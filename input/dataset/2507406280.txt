Why can't I give zero stars?This place is horrible. We rented a vehicle through them online and I regret it. I should've known better when I saw the looks on the faces of their  'staff' at the desk. They clearly did not care about their customers, or probably anything else for that matter.  We are Nevada residents, and they add undisclosed 'locals' fees to your rental and then argue with you about it. (These fees were not disclosed anywhere when we made our reservation.) The manager is especially awful and told me point blank that they hate renting to Nevada residents.  He followed me out the door yelling at me and threatening me.  If you don't want to deal with someone shady- stay away from this place.
