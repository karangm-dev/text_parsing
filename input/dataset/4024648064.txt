Tasty Food and Good ServiceI found this hidden gem on Groupon... The food was quite excellent in flavor and the portion size. I came in hungry and left happily filled. I forgot what the food was called but it was a roast beef dish with rice and beans and really was tasty!The service from the man I am guessing is the owner was good. They have some TVs playing football (soccer for Americans) and a definitely Peruvian feel for an atmosphere and overall color scheme.
