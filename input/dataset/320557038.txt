Went for breakfast! Food was horrible! Service was equally as bad! If you want dry mashed potatoes this is your place! I asked for some gravy or something to make the potatoes edible and the waitress looked at me like I was an idiot and then charged me $4 for gravy! Not to mention the guy that grabs you and takes your picture at the door and then interrupts your meal to try and sell you a copy for $20!
