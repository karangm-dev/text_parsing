Been going there for over 2 years love the doctor...but evey time that i need a refill on me Vitamin D and Metformin for Diabetes they make me go thru the hussle of making an appointment or no refill..not talking about that even after an appointment it take 2-3 days to get to the pharmacy if I'm lucky. 3 days ago my wife went to the pharmacy to get a refill for me and they told her threyl contact me Dr office, I went there today guess what? The pharmacist tells me your Dr declined the refill without even calling me, Fri night  and I'm out of my Diabetes meds thanks a lot  :( hello you guys in Genesis some people work 6 days week 12 hours days and don't have time to go through this.
