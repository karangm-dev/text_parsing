Went for breakfast yesterday, the food was decent, I didn't like the home fries, they had a overload of rosemary on them and the waiter told me they couldn't be cooked without them because they come like that, so I switched to the hash brown, they were really good with tons of ketchup. The pork chop was really good, better then I expected, the egg was egg, and the coffee was ok. Probably won't be going back.
