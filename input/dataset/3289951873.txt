I remember coming to this place when I was a kid back in the 90's.  This was before all the new restaurants opened up in Golden Square and it only had Big Bowl Congee, Chiu Chow Man and The Star Fast Food.  At that point in time, Star Fast Food was one of the better options at that time as you could probably get a meal for 4-5 people for $20 including tea.  So it gets one star for "nostalgia" factor.  However, I went recently and while the prices remain cheap, the food appears to be have gotten worse.  I got the fried fish with cream corn that came with rice and soya milk for around $6.50.  While the portion was ample and the fish was fried fairly well, the cream corn sauce was pretty sad. It was very watered down cream of corn soup.  It used to be a lot better because it was creamier.  I think this place can do in a pinch, but I'd much rather go to any of other places in this plaza.
