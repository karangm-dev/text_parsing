Worst service ever.  I've never had any issue with getting a hot fudge with a love it... even when i go to corporate in scottsdale they do it with no problem.  Tables were dirty, one of the staff didn't know how to make several things. Side conversations about customers when they dispute a problem. Stock items on counters where food is.
