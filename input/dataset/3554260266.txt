Just SO good! It's SO tough to find a tasty AND allergy friendly brunch place but we finally did! Not only were we pleasantly surprised to find out they don't use soy oil but then we found out the pancakes and waffles are but-free! And when you visit a restaurant with people without allergy/food restrictions, they don't usually find anything tasty. Luckily that is not the case! The chicken IS all it's cracked up to be! They're syrup is like pure caramel! Macarons melt in your mouth! Fresh strawberry muddled lemonade or tea! We will definitely be back!
