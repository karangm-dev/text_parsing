Their tire center is the worst. Just needed one tire replaced, and they had my car for 3 hours. They couldn't ring up my paperwork because the guy put it in wrong and then they needed a CSM to void out the old one. Apparently the woman has called the CSM 4 times but no one has showed up in an hour. A few customers were waiting for battery replacements, but that's another thing they can't do without a CSM, who didn't show up. One customer walked out, and still no CSM. When he does show up, he said he never heard the call, tinkers on the computer for a second, then leaves without doing anything. Several customers are waiting, the front desk woman is incompetent. Don't come here for anything time-sensitive, it won't happen. By far, the worst experience at a Walmart Tire Center I've ever had. Find a different one.
