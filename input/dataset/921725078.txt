YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM went to the cart at Food Truck Friday across the street and got blackberry margarita flavor and my friend got the chocolate orange. Very tasty and refreshing, they melt kinda fast though. I like to think its because they are all natural. Kinda pricey at $2.50 each but a very yummy treat.
