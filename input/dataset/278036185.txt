ABSOLUTELY hate this store! I've only been in about 3 times to this store but there is a reason for that.  All 3 times I've ever been to the store it seems no one wants to help me. Everytime I've been in, I stand there for 5+ minutes with no one to help me. Not even a friendly "hello". My most recent visit was to just simply pick up a new phone case for my son.  Walked in, waited, and waited. Numerous employees would walk by, have direct eye contact with me, and continue to ignore me. People who walked in after I had arrived and waited were getting helped right away before me. I really don't like making an issue because I've worked years in retail and I know how it can be. But customer service is a big deal to me and if it's a terrible experience, I will give my opinion.  Otherwise how do you learn it's a bad experience. But I decided to let a store employee know that I had waited, was never greeted, and had other shoppers helped before me. This is the last time I'll ever go into this store. I will only go to other ones I've had better experiences at or shop online.  If you have all the patience in the world, it's still a waste of your time waiting for someone who does not want to help you.
