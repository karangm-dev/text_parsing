I've had century link for a year now and at the there were no problems until I dropped the internet service then my phone stopped working and I waited for 4 days on my 2 days off for 2 weeks and the repair man never showed up then lied and told me I showed up and you weren't home. I called century link and they blaming me I will never use them again I guess they forgot we have cell phones and home phones are obsolete in the year 2015
