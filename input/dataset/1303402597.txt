i would give 10 stars if possible. I have always been the biggest chicken when it comes to dentists. I have had such bad experiences. Thanks to the reviews on yelp I found Dr. McAdams. All I can say is WOW!This was the best experience from the appointment process to the actual visit itself.The staff is so cordial. The place itself is ultra modern.As it turned out I needed a tooth pulled. I FELT ABSOLUTELY NO PAIN!  The demeanor of Dr. McAdams was so soothing. Candice his assistant was a doll.I always had to be put out for such a visit, but when I tell you that I walked out in disbelief that the local novacaine did the trick was a dream!  I would HIGHLY recommend this practice.  Again, let me say even 10 stars isn't enough.Thank you so much Dr. McAdams.
