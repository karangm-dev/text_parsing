Wanted to like the place.  So many people seem to rave about it.  Admittedly I was doing take out and didn't get the full perspective but ordered pad thai and nother beef with broad noodle dish and was underwhelemed.  I know that it is "asian fusian" but the menu was mostly Thai with some sushi thrown in for good measure.  I gave the hostess my order and waited at the bar.  There was no service at the bar save for some water.  no on came by to check on me despite telling someone that i wanted a beer and some edamame to snack on while I waited.  I got the order home and it was piping hot which is usually a good sign.  i was a little disappointed that the boxes had leaked and there was a bit of a mess coming out but the food was well, bland.  i had asked for medium spicy and got ho-hum spicy on both noodle dishes.  The noodles were overcooked and mushy.  The proteins were tough.  they tasted as if they had been blanched and then thrown in to warm with the already overcooked noodles.  I had ordered a chicken corn soup which had good flavor but more of that overcooked chicken and absolutely no corn.  it looked like egg drop soup that I could have made in my sleep.  not a huge fan :(
