I heard this place was pretty good so I decided to try it out, my experience was bad. I've been to similar pizza places with the same "build-your-own" concept. I began building my pizza and when I got to the "proteins" I told the guy (didn't have a name tag) that I wanted all the proteins then he quickly said "You can't do that, the cheese won't cook all the way". I've been to Pieology and Fired Pie and they both had no issue with allowing me to put all the proteins and the pizzas cooked to perfection. It didn't seem like this guy was too fond of my idea of putting every meat because maybe they lose money that way or something, regardless I was shocked that this was my custom pizza and I couldn't even customize it to my liking. I ordered a pizza anyway and it was sub-par. Not bad I guess but next time I'll make the drive to Fired Pie in Downtown Phoenix instead.
