Very Mod looking place ... but I found the food to be pretty bland and my carmel latte just okay ... DOG FRIENDLY patio a major plus for me and my dog.Forgot all about this post until this came into my MySpace account from the OWNER!  Date:      May 27, 2006 8:02 PM   Flag spam/abuse. [ ? ]Subject:  hey daveBody:  i don't know you from adam...but i have to tell you how i feel about random folk posting negativity about drip coffee lounge. or any place for that matter.i find it totally lame.if you thought my organic food was bland, i'd much rather you tell me, talk to me about it so i could attempt to make it non bland for you....i wonder what you ordered?no you have to spew negativity into the world.curious if i was the barista that made your carmel latte???regardless if you care enough to come back to drip i'll attempt to make you a beverage that suits your tastes.if it was easy i guess everyone and their brother would have a cafe.From:http://www.myspace.com/gbellgrrl  take care---End---Well ... there you go ... building a community one person at a time!  I say the Lux "Community" is just fine ... and the coffee ... service much better ... I was originally being kind ... honestly this is the most pretentious place I've ever walked into ... and there is NOTHING cool about it ... zero substance ... only pretension ... fashion and style ... but so sorry you can't buy cool ... and this place proves it on a daily basis.
