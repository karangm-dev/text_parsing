What a fun way to get your your girlfriends together and have fun! Not really knowing what to expect because this was supposed to be a stripper class it ended up being so much more. The instructor Pony was so great and we all had so much fun with her! I learned so many great moves and it wasn't just about the pole. We were on chairs and even did things with fun girly toys! My friends still talk about it and I have fun memories! Next time I go I'm bringing my stripper heals because that's the one thing I forgot to bring with me! Loved this and want to do it again!
