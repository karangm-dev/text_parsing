I had my Jeep washed here twice, the first time they did their detailing job which was overpriced at 89.00, the treatments they put on the exterior washed off in the rain two days later leaving streaks all over the place. This last time I made the mistake of leaving a set of Bose earphones worth $145.00 on the console and an audio cable worth $10.00 on the dashboard, and the attendant doing the cleaning obviously figured they needed them more than I did. In short don't trust this operation. Mesa location!
