I'm such a fan!  Our Nishikawa Black Ramen bowl was everything I hope it would be in this chilly, rainy winter evening after a day spent hiking in the rain.  It was rich and deep, full of interesting flavors and textures and all the umami I dreamed of.  The spring rolls and gyoza were also yummy but the star of the show was definitely ramen.It was soooo busy tonight, we were seated fairly quickly and our food came out fast.  Our waitress forgot our drink orders and didn't really check on us but I'm sure she saw we were busy slurping our noodles.  The restaurant is clean and small.  The prices are good!If you're looking for a good ramen spot, go!  I'll be back soon.  It was incredible!
