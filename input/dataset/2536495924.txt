I used to enjoy the ease of ordering from Pizza Care and many of my coworkers began ordering from them, based on my recommendation. Unfortunately neither they nor I will be ordering from them in the future. Today I placed an order during the 11 o'clock hour, to be delivered for a lunch meeting at work. Along with the street number, I included the name of the business and the suite number. Once the meeting started I was not available to answer my phone, so I missed the call from the driver. He refused to deliver the food to my suite and instead offered to meet me in the lobby. I requested a refund since my food was not delivered as requested. The company will instead only deliver the food to me at another time of my choosing. I'm hoping they'll at least remove the 30+ percent tip I'd already added!
