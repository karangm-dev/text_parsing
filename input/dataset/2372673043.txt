Not at all what I expected! Donny Tackett @ Land Rover Las Vegas really went above and beyond to make our deal happen.  He came in on his day off and took care of us on the purchase of a new Range Rover. Nothing like an experienced salesperson to help with the process. I highly recommend Donny as well as the Dealer.  Lowest price I could find on the West Coast. Thanks Again!
