My wife bought an Impreza from Markham Subaru after shopping around for weeks. We hated the high-pressure sales antics at car dealerships so it was comforting stepping into Markham Subaru where everyone was laid back and no one was hyper to get the next sale. We dealt directly with Carlo who appeared to be the owner.The dealership was sold out of some models, so Carlo checked his province-wide listing and pointed us to other dealerships which possessed those vehicles, even though it meant sacrificing a sale.Once we decided on a vehicle, Carlo gave us a no-haggle price which was firm. Everything he did was up-front and transparent.We ended up purchasing our car from Carlo, primarily because of his rigid integrity. However, upon delivery of the vehicle, we were disappointed that some details did not turn out as we ordered. There was also a scratch on the door vinyl and a stain on the sunroof upholstery. Carlo offered to replace the scratched paneling, but we have to live with the sunroof stain because of the enormous work needed to replace that part.From the opened garage area door, I also had a chance to watch the dealership's detailing guy (named Francis) working on various cars and was impressed with his passion for detailing. Without doubt, Francis is a true perfectionist. Despite the disappointment we experienced, I'd have to rate Markham Subaru five stars. It was pleasant dealing with people who are downright honest and go the extra mile to be caring.If our next car is also a Subaru, we won't go anywhere except Markham Subaru. We would have saved ourselves a huge amount of time and travel expense by dealing with Carlo right from the beginning.
