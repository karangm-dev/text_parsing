Stopped in with two friends on a Saturday. We were visiting from out of town and in Scottsdale for a meeting starting the next morning so wanted to have a relaxing night before it started. This was the perfect place to do so.We got seats at the bar and it wasn't too loud. We split two bottles of wine which were super reasonably priced and also ordered a cheese plate. The ambiance here was awesome, i would definitely go back and would recommend it to a friend. Next time i am in Scottsdale I would definitely stop in again!
