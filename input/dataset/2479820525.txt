We came on a weekday, and it was very busy. We sat at the bar and ordered a pepperoni pizza and lasagna. It was a huge disappointment. Their pizza tasted like it was from the box, and the pasta wasn't anything great. The only thing that wasn't a disappointment were the prices. They're affordable and cheaper than the other pizza/pasta places around the area. I've had the El Diablo shrimp pasta and it wasn't anything special either. The two stars are for the mediocre service. The restaurant itself is charming, and shows a lot of history.
