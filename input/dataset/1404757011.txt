I  really believe that my mother is in the kitchen-  I will NEVER be convinced otherwise.We were attended to as if we were of great importance (I'm in love)Information you can use: The place doesn't look like much from the street but when you go inside it's quaint with comfy outside seating. There's a nice footbridge that makes you feel like crossing into a secret little world. Staff are attentive so customer service is on 10. The food: You need to get over here yesterday...
