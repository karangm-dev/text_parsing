Do not use this company! They were referred to us by AHS. They sent a tech out who didn't diagnose the issue, but fixed a piston. The next night I ran the pool and my side yard was flooded. They sent another tech out who figured out the problem and said the filter housing was cracked. They claimed it was cracked from too much pressure. The pool was backwashed the weekend before and I cleaned the filters a few weeks prior. Due to their terrible diagnosis, my claim was denied. They got their money, AHS was paid as well, but we did not get our issue fixed. Terrible company, I would not trust them to do any work on a pool related issue.
