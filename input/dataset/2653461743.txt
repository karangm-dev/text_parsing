This is the best Thai food restaurant I've been to in my life. No joke. Family owned, nice atmosphere, it can get crowded at times because its popularity, and of course the food is on point. My favorites/go-tos are pad thai, pad see ew, panang curry, and pineapple fried rice. A good appetizer I really like is their thai toast. My girlfriend's favorite restaurant, for one period of time we went twice a week almost. If I could give this place a 6/5, I would.Overall:Service - 5Food - 5Wait time - 4 ~ 5Cleanliness - 5
