Our party of 7 dined here on one of the nights in Vegas because we were at the Wynn and wanted Asian food.Red 8 is a casual Asian fusion restaurant. You will find Vietnamese, Cantonese, Thai, and Indian here. We ordered a number of dishes and did family style. Here's what we ordered: Beef Chow FunWonton Soup (2 orders)Shrimp WalnutKung Pao ShrimpMongolian BeefWe didn't have high expectations or anything, BUT all the dishes were terrible. It was bland and had no flavor. On top of that, each dish was tiny portions and double the price of the average Chinese restaurant. Service was not great either. I wish he was more attentive. Our bill was $150--no drinks with gratuity included. NEVER again.
