entered a 1 star only because they provided a roof over our heads. looking for a place to get diarrhea fast? go here. walked into 3 employees playing hangman, ignored us when we needed to be seated until I pulled the old *ahem* move. Sat down to have watered down sweet tea, babies crying, and the grungiest of the grunge eating next to us. The food... BLEGCK!! Everything was over cooked, sticky white rice, the egg drop soup was cold, everything was horrible. So bad in fact, we left. There were little desert squares that looked like they could be lemon bars, AVOID THEM, they smelt like locker room feet. All in all, i would never recommend this place, no matter how hungry, hung over, or cheap you are! *see attached picture
