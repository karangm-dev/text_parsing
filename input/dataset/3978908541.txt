I love to eat, but I also love to save! I had a groupon for this place and needed to use it. Located on Flamingo and Durango in a shopping center. We walked in and the atmosphere was nice in here , they were playing a classical mix which I thought was different but it was pleasant. Right away I was greeted by a very friendly server who suggested the combo bowl. My friend ordered the combo ramen. The food was delicious! I ordered my bowl with a brown garlic sauce on top but I love spicy food so the waiter brought out two different sauces. I also ordered the milk boba tea which was also really good! I have no complaints of this place and I hope more people find out about this place cause it was great prices,service and food!
