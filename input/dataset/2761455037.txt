Not a place I would go for dinner, but they have food to eat if you work up an appetite golfing. Great place to practice your swings during the day, and at night it turns into a night life mini golf place with Cosmo lights on the course. They also have bags, jinga, and other great games to play. Their sangria is also amazing!!
