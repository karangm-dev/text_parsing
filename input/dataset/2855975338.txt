Having seen over 12 different Cirque du Soleil shows, I was looking real forward to Love. Being a huge Beatles fan. The show didn't disappoint. It was played in the round so there wasn't a bad seat in the house and with speakers built in the chairs you defiantly could hear the music. Great video enhanced the show. There is action going on everywhere , I can't wait to see it again to see what I missed it. Another hit !!
