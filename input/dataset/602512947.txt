AVOID. For some reason, everytime I eat here I always get sick. The place is not exactly clean. The kitchen looks disgusting. This is perhaps the worst Denny's restaurant in existence. We regularly stop in, not by choice but due to a family member's preference for this horrible, horrible restaurant.  Well... the food quality is adequate, but smaller than usual portions... and the service is nonexistent. For example:  It's 5 p.m. and there are two employees on duty and that includes the cook. It will take 20 or 30 minutes simply to get a glass of water. 30-45 for appetizers. 2-3 hours for the full meal (not including the time it takes to eat it.)  If you want to eat something, plan on waiting. To be clear, this is not a fault of the waitresses, this is a chronic management problem.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this place. Go to the Village Inn, go to McDonald's, go anywhere else but here. The only reason why this Denny's is still in business is because seniors obviously have extremely low standards and cannot perceive the passage of time. It shouldn't take 3 hours to have a freaking meal unless it's Thanksgiving.  The management and staff who work at this restaurant at absolutely no pride in themselves whatsoever.  They're only there to pick up a paycheck, work as less as possible, and leave. Denny's Corporation is a joke. Luckily, for the managers, the senior citizens who frequent this restaurant are extremely apathetic and don't complain. That's the only reasonable explanation why this restaurant is still in business.
