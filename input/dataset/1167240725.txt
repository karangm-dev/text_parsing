I love this place for their patio as we're always looking for restaurants to take the pup along. Such a neat, tucked away little gem. With all the commotion around Montford and Park Rd Shopping Center, it would be easy to never know this place is there. The patio has fairly nice landscaping which makes for a very nice ambiance.Only reason for the 2 star review is for the inconsistencies. One night you'll get amazing service, the next night you'll get a server that seems like he/she (usually she) hates his/her life. They have an awesome menu with several vegetarian options. Really enjoy this place, just wish the friendliness came out a little more on a consistent basis. It's also nice too have a late night food menu option!My go to's: Roasted Vegetables and Black Bean Nachos - it's not often you find a solid nacho option that doesn't have beef or chicken. Ginger Salmon Burger with aioli slaw
