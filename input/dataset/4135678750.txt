BBQ done right. Everything everyone has ever said about this place is true. Amazing food. If you plan on going, make sure you have at least 2-3 hours of your day blocked out because you'll be standing in line for a good hour waiting. Is it worth? I'd say so. I heard there's a second location popping up around the west valley and I am excited for that one.
