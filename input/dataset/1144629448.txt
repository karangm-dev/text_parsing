My man Edgar! He's finally opened his own place where he can focus on his clients his way. There are few people that offer the quality and service that Edgar does. He's passionate about his work and puts 110% into each cut, trim, and style.The Manner is the ideal place for your hair and beard needs. There are a variety of options available that you can book directly through Yelp. I recommend you book well ahead of time, as this man gets booked quickly! Edgar is a genuine gentleman who will treat you like family.
