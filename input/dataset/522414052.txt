Like most people, I went there with a friend after seeing it on Triple D. Since the first trip, I have been by multiple times and have loved it each time. There used to be a little bar area near the brick oven so I sat there the first time I went and it was great because we were able to talk with the son of the owner, I guess they are co-owners, and talk about the place and how much Triple D has increased their customer base. He was extremely friendly and of course, the pizza was fantastic. They have the best White Pizza I have every had. It is delicious and perfectly made. I have had it numerous times and have never been disappointed.I would recommend this place to anyone!
