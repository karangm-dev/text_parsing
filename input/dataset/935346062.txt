$7.59 for an unsatisfying, not thick chocolate milkshake...I don't think so.  It tastes like they put half a scoop of ice cream and 2 cups of milk.  High price + low-quality equals horrible.  Drinks come in only one size to force you to buy the expensive one. The Ben & Jerry's name no longer carries value in the retail space.  McDonald's has a better tasting chocolate shake than B&J. If you want to waste your money come here.
