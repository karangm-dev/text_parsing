The Fountains of Bellagio are very impressive to watch.  We always bring family and friends here to enjoy this free show.  There is nothing much that I can add that has not been mentioned in other reviews.The only thing that is better than watching the show outside is to watch the show inside.  If you book a room at the Bellagio with a lake view, you will not regret it.  Turn the television channel to the music for the water show, and then watch the display!  It is awesome!  There is no better way to experience the Fountains of Bellagio than watching it in the privacy of your own room with your special someone!!!
