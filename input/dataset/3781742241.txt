Do yourself a favor and go here! There were 50 beers on tap and even more in bottles. We tried several types and our server, Daniel, was very in tune to what we liked and made several great suggestions to get us to try new ones. ASK FOR DANIEL! He is outstanding and knows his product! If you want to try different kinds of beer and eat some great German and Traditional American or Canadian food, then this the place!
