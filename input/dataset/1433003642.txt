I found this little Gem today on a referral from a friend. The outside doesn't do the inside justice.  Great Service and atmosphere. The beignets are wonderful and took me back home to Cafe' DuMonde.  The muffaletta was excellent, best I have had outside of Central Grocery in the French Quarter.  Selection might be small to some, but the quality of the food more than makes up for it.  The owner came out and talked to me and the other patrons and thanked us for coming.  It was wonderful to find a little piece of home here in Pheonix.  Will absolutely be going back to try their King Cake! Laissez les bon temps rouler!
