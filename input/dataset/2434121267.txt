This store is horrible, first it is like a ghost town you have to find people to help you.  Second if you put something in layaway u won't get the same item u had put away.  I put a bike in layaway and when I returned to pick up my layaway another bike had been put in it's place one the employees switched the bikes.  A manager was called they checked for the bike again and came up with nothing.  My options were to pick another bike or receive a refund which I did.  Another day I returned to the store to pick up another layaway again there were very few employees. I'm went to the layaway depart no one was there I asked a man who worked there if he could call someone to come to the layaway department.  His reply was u have to go to the electronics department.  I walked to the front of the store and tried to get some assistance at the customer service department where I was ignored by a lady behind the counter who was to busy messing with her cellphone.  Back at the layaway department I ran into another employee who was inside the layaway department she asked me if I had been helped I said no and that I needed to pick up my layaway again I was told I had to go to the electronics department to pick up my layaway.  At no time did the employee offer to help me.  I went to the electronics department where I encountered another rude employee who Finally got my layaway then started throwing my items in a bag balling them up.  BEWARE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AT THIS STORE IT IS HORRIBLE YOU WILL ONLY END UP PISSED OFF. THE EMPLOYEES ARE RUDE AND WILL NOT HELP YOU.  Take my advice drive to another location!
