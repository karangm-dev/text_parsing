Went to this store today looking for a window.  Sign says NO RETURNS !!  Measure 3 times !Everything  here is sold as is.Found a window that had $230.00 written on it after freezing our #$#%$ off for an hour looking.  Rolled it up the window to pay for it and discovered that all their windows are on consignment and a 12% adder would have to be applied.  Then tax as well.  I understand the tax but no where did I see the consignment adder warning posted.  After they did the math our cost with adder and tax went up to $280.00.  I walked.  I can get the same window elsewhere for less money and a warranty at least (I checked).
