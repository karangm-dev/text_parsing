Our experience was nothing like the ones mentioned below. We ordered chicken tikka masala, paneer tikka masala and dal makhani. The food taste was not good at all, to say the least, it didnt taste indian at all except the daal that was good but not dal makahni for sure. The gulab jamun was better left alone as we did.
