After reading the reviews, myself and 3 friends decided to try it. It was really busy, good sign I thought. Then we sat down and the fun began. First, its customer base is much older than I would have thought and the conversations overheard provided some entertainment. This was actually a good thing because the food took an unusually long amount of time to come out. We all ordered from the restaurant week menu which supported the local food bank. The food was barely warm and not that tasty and actually rather bland, refills of drinks took forever and the server was barely around. None of us finished our meals and we didn't care to take them with us either. This place is all hype, don't waste your time or money.I've had much better food that was much better priced and in an atmosphere more around my age group. We all decided it was our first and last visit to honeysalt.
