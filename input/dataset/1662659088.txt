The racks were not well taken care of and the two guys working on the mens floor were playing grab ass and couldn't be bothered. I scanned the racks looking for my size. It was difficult because nothing is in order. The sizes are all mixed up. I tried on a few items but decided to pass. The entire 45 minutes I was there not one employee ever said anything to me. It was like going to my first high end swap meet. I will never go back.
