I rarely yelp, I'm not into the fad however when I feel a place deserves recognition, I will... Anyways, Emily our server was wonderful took care of us wonderfully even tho she was busy. The banana muffins are absolutely superb. My skillet was so good. Great portions I couldn't even finish it. Great first time experience... I totally recommend this place
