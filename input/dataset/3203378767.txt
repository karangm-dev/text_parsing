When my stylist left his previous salon, I followed him to NC salon.   Wil is very attentive, takes his time with hair cuts and gives you advice about what suits your face structure and skin tone.   This salon is a little pricey than the last, but then Wil did get promoted to a senior stylist level.   He does speak English, not Engrish.  (He also speaks Chinese, of course).  I came in with very sad looking hair and now, it looks amazing.
