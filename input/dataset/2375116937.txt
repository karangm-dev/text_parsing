I am a local Old Town resident and stopped by for a pizza and glass of wine last night. The owner, Marcellio, introduced himself and explained his wine purchasing; good wines at a reasonable price....available for purchase by the bottle or case. The house Chianti was very good. Marcellio is from Italy and been here about 15 years. Also, Sandy, the chef helped me pick out a couple pizzas that were thin crust and cooked in a wood fired pizza oven. Really good pizza! The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and reminded me of dining in Rome a few years ago.
