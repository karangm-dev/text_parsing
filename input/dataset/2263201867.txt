After reading all the high ratings, I felt confident about having a great meal here. Normally I don't write too negative of reviews, because every meal can't be perfect every time.....But I have to say, this place was disappointing. I'm always willing to pay higher prices for exceptional food. This food was average at best. Nothing different than an average breakfast chain. Overpriced for underwhelming food. I ordered over easy eggs, and they came way over cooked. I was then up-sold a side item, which he ended up forgetting to give me. But he said, "you won't get anything like this French toast anywhere" wow! I was excited to try this French Toast winner. I'll just say, sigh, disappointing. The service was confusing. With the high price point, you would expect good classy service, but this guy was, how should I say it, tacky, rude. Made the poor little girl at our table so uncomfortable with his "just kidding jokes". Made constant silly jokes, forgot a part of my meal, and when I asked about it, he made me feel like I was wrong. I basically had to argue to get this French toast, that he convinced me to try. This server blew it. When you pay $25-$30 for breakfast per person, your server should be attentive and kind. Our table left paying over $65 for an average breakfast and decided we will not be returning.
