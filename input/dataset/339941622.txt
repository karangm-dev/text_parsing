Went in for a lunch. Steak sandwich was delicious, and the Caesar salad had an absolutely delicious dressing, with a perfect amount of dressing, and distributed perfectly across each leaf. I know I'm going on about the salad ... But it was perfect.Drink prices were pretty good.The Server, Dawn, was friendly and accommodating. Very happy with her.In summation, a great pub experience. Would go again!
