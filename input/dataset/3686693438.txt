I went to the chapel with my family to pray since we missed church because i have night shift. When we got to the chapel there was a small class with less than 10 students that was about to start. We were thrown out because they were having a class. I asked the teacher if we can just sit for a bit to pray and she said we cant. Its just very disappointing that we weren't allowed to pray quietly in the chapel.  I was brought up knowing that everyone is welcome in the house of God. In the first place i don't think a chapel is place to hold a class at. I find it disrespectful to turn it into a classroom. The teacher should have realized that she is showing a very bad example to the students. Teachings of God is best taught by example.
