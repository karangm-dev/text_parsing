Paragon Glass arranged for me to get my glass fixed and tinted while I was in Phoenix for vacation.  A couple of months later something in the back window area is leaking and she started working hard to get it fixed and cleaned up even without known 100% if it is the back window leaking.  Excellent, fast, knowledgeable customer service!
