I seriously can not get enough of this place. Every time we go to Vegas I have to go here. What you get for the price is just awesome.  I don't know how they are not busier. Yea you can go to a lot of other places and pay twice the price and still not get as good of choices as you can here. You get bottomless mimosas, plus a wide variety of food. Theres crab, asian, mexican, bbq, pho, and almost anything else your heart desires. This time I brought a friend that is vegan and she was still able to eat like a queen.  The dessert station gets better and better every time we go there. The thing that is a little troublesome is that the plates are always too hot at the dessert station, so all my chocolate melts before I get it to the table. I also think having an Ice Cream station would be super cool too! Overall though you have to come here, it's not a super fancy buffet. I am saying for the price though you can't really beat it and I guarantee you will leave feeling full and happy.
