Slow and rude. Only giving them two stars because the outdoor seating is lovely, and their gelato was pretty good. Other than that, this place is a one-star establishment. My fiancé and I came to GC while visiting my brother and his family. I live in La Jolla and my fiancé lives in Los Angeles, and there is no reason AT ALL that the service at a place of this caliber (or any caliber really) should be much ruder than anywhere in San Diego or LA. Secondly... it was so unbelievably slow. Our breakfast burrito took over 30 minutes (maybe even over 40), and it was mediocre at best. As were our drinks... Blah.
