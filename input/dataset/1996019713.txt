My husband and I went to Sea Witch tonight for dinner.  I'm suuuuuuper pregnant and today is actually my due date.  Pretty exciting.  Pretty pumped to eat some fish and chips in our new 'hood.  Celebrate what is possibly our last day as non-zombie parents.  Happy day happy day!Walked up to the door of Sea Witch...slowly because I'm as big as a damn house, and the dude literally locks the door in our face.  Just looks at us and shrugs.  Seriously?  Seriously?!  It was exactly 8pm, and a couple of non-preggos with fully functional bodies walked in an were seated not one minute before us.  I just couldn't get there fast enough.  It takes me 10 minutes to get out of bed right now.  Cut a girl some slack.Cold, dude.  Cold.  So thanks for making this hugely pregnant woman cry on her due date (because fat preggos cry over literally everything).  Now I'm at home waiting for delivery pizza, and will never come back to Sea Witch.Also to the dude that locked the door in our faces and just shrugged like 'whoops, the door is locked foreverzzzzzz', I hope that you're a woman in your next life and get super fat and people are mean to you.
