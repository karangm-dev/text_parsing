This place is awesome! I decided to check them out after coming across a free hot dog coupon in the Knights baseball program.I got the Quarter Hounder (queso, bacon lettuce, tomato, special sauce) and a create your own (sauerkraut, queso, bacon, chili) with a side of homemade chips (with homemade ranch dipping sauce). I would get both again no question about it. The hot dogs casing had the perfect grilled snap when you bite into one and the buns are the perfect length so that you don't have any bites of just bread.The staff was very helpful (and patient as it took us entirely too long to decide on our order as everything sounded good). They were very flexible with the coupon as well. They have a variety of seating areas to choose from.. Indoor AC area, some patio seating on the ground floor and a rooftop patio. After you place your order you take a number with you to your table and the food is brought out to you. Out food was brought out without minutes of sitting down and everything tastes warm and fresh!Definitely will be back. It certainly does not hurt that there is a King of Pops cart in the parking lot to grab some dessert on your way out either..
