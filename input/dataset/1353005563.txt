A big letdown. I have been to the Ahwatukee location a handful of times and have had decent experiences. There was nothing decent about this experience. First, we arrived at about 635p and happy hour ends at 7. We did not anticipate getting there in time for happy hour, but we were so that was a bonus in my mind. However, the hostess said there would be a wait even though there were 2 empty tables and one empty booth within sight. After waiting for about 10 minutes, we were just about to ask what was wrong with the empty tables when she sat us at the very booth that had been sitting empty the whole time we were waiting. WTH?The waitress asked for our drink order and my old lady asked if it was still happy hour prices, and the waitress said "if it is before 7". WTF? The answer is a yes or no. I checked my phone and said it was 650p, so is that yes?  Then I asked if they had Guinness on draft, since there were HH prices on import drafts. She said "yes, but there's no specials on Guinness". "What about this list of HH prices?"  "We don't do those anymore."  "So none of these prices are valid?"  "Let me check"As for the food, yawn. The wings were not nearly as good as what I have gotten at the Ahwatukee location. The Guinness did taste good though.  The old lady got a skinny Rita which was also a HH special, but they overcharged us for it. By that point, I was so sick of the servers attitude, I just paid it and took the difference out of her tip.Needless to say, the next time we are looking for wings in this area, someone else is getting our business.
