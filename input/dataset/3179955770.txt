We ended up working with Carisa Winklepeck as our lender. The lack of communication from the get-go was beyond poor. It would take days to hear back from her via email. Then days before closing, she tells us we need to come up with $5,000. What an absolute waste of everyone's time. She thinks barely mentioning a down payment in one of the first emails she sent us before we were even pre-approved, is her telling us we needed five thousand dollars as a down payment?! We will not be working with you again. "Poor communication" is right.
