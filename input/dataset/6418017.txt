So my buddy knows Kevin, the main guy here. Greg is unfortunately on medical leave. So we decided to have another woman help us who works here. Her name is Teg. From the get go, she has been frustrating. It's like we are pulling teeth to make a business cards. We asked for the book of deisgn layouts and she gave us the wrong booklets. So I took it upon myself to go in the corner where she had a whole stack and ended up finding the large 2 foot thick binder of business card designs. After finding a good layout, we write down the paper product id, the font, and email her- verbatim the wording we want on front and back. She was still having issues understanding what we wanted and needed. She kept talking to us with concern about how much extra te cost would be for media on the card or the glossy vs matte finish. Finally, we arrive at a somewhat decent mutual understanding, and are told that drafts will be emailed tonight. Boy do I have a headache. I hope nothing goes wrong!
