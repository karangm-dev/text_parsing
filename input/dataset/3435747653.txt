The most frustrating thing about my son having ADD by FAR is dealing with Latisha in the referral department in the Mesa office. I'd rather have 12 unmedicated kids with ADD than deal with her. She is rude, every time we deal with her and that is her best quality. She has no interest in helping the patients and their families get the care they need. Even when you have to deal with her multiple times to help get an approval for meds, she acts like she has never talked to you before, doesn't remember anything you've talked about, refuses to make notes that help her remember and then (this blew me away!) says "can you just write up everything we've talked about so I can review it when I have time? I don't have time to make notes about this". REALLY? If she worked for me she'd be fired in a hot minute! It took me 5 WEEKS to get meds approved and insurance told me week after week they were waiting on her. They even faxed me proof they were waiting on her! I hope she has to deal with someone like her when she needs medical care! Buffy is amazing and Dr. Piacentine is great! Front office girls are not friendly. Probably trained by Latisha.
