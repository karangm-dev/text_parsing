This office's service provides a great example of why USPS should be run out of business. My mailman NEVER brings packages to my door -- NEVER. UPS, FedEx, and all others do. This weekend, he shoved a box in the tiny mailbox I'm allowed by this rip-off office that could not be removed from my side. There's a LIP on my side, numbnuts! Duh! There is no way this man is that stupid. He just didn't want to cross the street in sunny 75-degree weather. I remember when postmen delivered ON FOOT in 6 inches of snow. These spoiled, rude people need to catch on to the fact that WE DON'T NEED THEM ANYMORE. They're lucky to have jobs, and they had better start acting like it before they come to us taxpayers for a handout.
