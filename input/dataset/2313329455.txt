As part of the Buffet of Buffets, we came here for lunch.  I definitely would not pay to eat here if it wasn't for the BoB.  The variety was miniscule and the food was just mediocre.  There was a burrito bar where you can make your own burrito with either carne asada or chicken asada.  Both meats tasted like crap so I didn't have a burrito.  The guacamole didn't taste like real avocados.  The prime rib was ok and all that special.The service was also pretty slow.  Our waitress disappeared for a period of time and was a real disappointment here.  Overall, not one of the buffets I would choose to go to next time around for the BoB.
