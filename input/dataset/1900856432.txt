If you're looking for sub standard food, steak not cooked right the first time and when you send it back it comes the exact same way, service that doesn't write down what you want as sides or takes forever for drink refills than this is the place to be. I understand that this is a chain resteraunt and the level of giving a crap about your customers is low but I'm still spending money...
