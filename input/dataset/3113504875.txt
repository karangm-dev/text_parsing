This is a great place if you are interested in glass work.  This includes stained glass, flamework (bead making), fusing (melting glass), and glass blowing.  Their fusing center is open whenever the store is open with lots of little projects available from about $5 to about $50.  They also have classes ranging in the $50 to $300 range.  I've taken the flamework bead making class...twice.  I've also done the blown glass ornaments class.  Fusing classes I've tried include the fused strips bowl (twice), fused jaws bowl (twice), and hanging air plant holder.  There are more I want to try too...when I can fit them into my schedule.The staff is helpful, and super talented...stop in to see their work, available for purchase too.
