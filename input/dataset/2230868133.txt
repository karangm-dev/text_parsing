I came here for 'licious dinner last Friday and was less than impressed with the food and the service. To me, it was pretty clear that Osteria is a new restaurant and they are still trying to get their footing as there were many lags during the meal and the servers were mixed up with which table ordered what. Both my friend and I got the scallops to start which were soggy. The sauce was good though, very buttery. I think the server gave us someone else's order as it came out really quickly and then shortly after we finished it the same server came to give us another serving of them! I got the steak medium rare - it was more medium as it was very thin (you get what you pay for, right). The veggies it came with were good though... you can tell they were a bit caramelized. My friend got the penne. Her penne was nothing special and the pasta was underdone and a bit hard to chew. I really could have made better penne at home. Lastly, our dessert took over half an hour to get to us. We had to ask after we noticed it was nearly 20 mins and the sun had already set - it got pretty cold. We did get an apology from the server but no realty explanation as to why it was late besides "I put it in the system but it somehow got missed". Overall, I probably wouldn't come back here as there are better restaurants in the area, although admittedly, the pizza did look very good (I was peeking at other tables lol). The patio was a little awkward as it was on an obvious slant so I was sitting lower than my friend and there was lots of movement of different tables around me to accommodate changing party sizes.
