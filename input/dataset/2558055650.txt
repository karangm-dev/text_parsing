To say my experience at Arizona Donut Company was terrible would be an understatement. For starters I go in and order two drinks with boba and some donuts I wait 30 minutes for my drinks. Two other people came in five minutes after me ordered and got their drinks and were out of there before I could even blink my eyes. After what seemed to be an eternity I was relieved that I had finally received the delicious boba that I hold so dear in my heart. I'm ecstatic I am like a boy on Christmas morning. This is the best feeling in the world. Nothing else could possibly go wrong. Right? Wrong answer. I take a drink of that delicious boba and to my surprise my delicious cookies and cream boba delight has these small flakes of what seemed to be plastic in my drink. Once I noticed this I brought it to the employees attention and stated that there was something wrong with my drink and she replied that there is nothing wrong with my drink and there was no way she was going to refund my money and or make me something different. And she said this in the most broken terrible excuse for English that had ever touched my delicate ears. She said her boss was in the back so I told her to get him, low and behold the fella in the back sweeping the floors was not her boss and also had broken English. Possibly the worst customer service and dining experience I have ever had. I will never return there again. If you can't train your employees to complete the functions of their job then don't own a business. This speaks to the true character of the person who owns this horrendous establishment. Thank you.
