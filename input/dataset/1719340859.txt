Apps are generally good but I'd avoid the French onion soup unless you LOVE salt....  Service is a mixed bag depending on who you get.  Our entrees on our most recent visit were disappointing but I've been here and enjoyed the food before... Restaurant is usually pretty understaffed I assume to maximize profits but having tables sit dirty for an hour is very unbecoming.... I want to like it here there's just too much inconsistency....
