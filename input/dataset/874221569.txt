We eat here pretty much weekly. My husband was born and raised in Albuquerque; I lived there for 7 years so we are super picky regarding green/red chile. The green chile is HOT (recently especially) but it's so tasty. I love the red equally so I do 'Christmas' (that's green and red!) on my food. Try the chicken burrito, the ground beef burrito, carne asada tacos, chorizo breakfast plate (order any time), chile rellenos, and if you can spare some calories, the fry bread. Free chips and salsa. Note to iced tea drinkers: it's the gold peak stuff but they do offer unsweetened. Fresh brewed tea would make a good upgrade one day. I hope you enjoy it!!
