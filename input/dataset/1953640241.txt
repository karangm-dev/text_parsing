The food was actually really good. I enjoyed the sushi. But the service was horrendous. Possibly the worst service I have ever experienced. The servers walked right by us, and blatantly ignored us. I assume it's because some of our table wasn't ordering alcohol. We booked a table a week and a half in advance as it was my sisters 30th birthday. They sat us on the patio, with half of the seating we actually reserved and said "they don't take reservations." They eventually moved us to an actual table after we complained but ignored us the rest of the night. Our glasses were empty, even after we asked for refills. We never had an actual server. The music was so loud we had to scream to try to talk to each other. The DJ was really good though. We will never be returning.
