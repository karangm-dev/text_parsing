Don't do it, man.I got in without waiting and without paying, sat at a VIP table during Memorial Day weekend, and I still thought this place was a waste of time and money. ok ok, it's full of lots of young people our age, which is an awesome change from Tryst, for example. All the girls were dressed to the nines and most of the guys could either be Abercrombie models or employess. The line of people trying to get in was at least 85% guys, so, yeah, eye candy everywhere, which is why I gave this place a star.But I swear, it's not worth it! The club is boring, and the music was really uninspiring. I feel like hot clubs should have amazing DJs and this one does not--not even close. The place is packed, which is good and bad but mostly bad if you're trying to move from where you're standing. I thought that the tiny Caramel lounge at Bellagio had WAY better music and people were giving away 2-for-1 drink coupons all night. Go there instead.
