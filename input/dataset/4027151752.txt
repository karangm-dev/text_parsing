Worse service ever in food court. Waited 40 minutes for food. Person passing out food very unconcerned until after the 2nd time saying something and waited 30 minutes before I said something the 1st time.After standing up there for 3 more minutes, I finally got my Mexican food. FOOD IS NOT WORTH THE WAIT. Lacks any seasoning. None, nada...Taco Bell has got it over on this Mexican food.1 issue is the older gray headed white man as I saw him constantly walking back and forth, appearing to lose his concentration while trying to prepare orders.They place all tickets on a slide and don't seem to follow any system. The just keep pushing  some tickets down and then prepare those roght in front of them. The darker skin man, appeared Hispanic, was slow but always seem to be rushing, runninglP around in circles too.I also saw a white lady, like a 'manager type', come in, talk to the gray headed man, she completely distracted him for at least 5 minutes, when, if she was a manager, step back and observe the employees.If she isn't, then i suggest a manager needs too. They could improve on consistent, faster and accurate orders, which produces better customer relations. Maybe a color code system for each specific food type ordered.Food needs more seasoning as well. Avoid beans.
