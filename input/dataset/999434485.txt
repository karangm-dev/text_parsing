all the "good" reviews here were posted by the owner...what staff?? there is a guy behind the counter stirring a wok with week old oil...and of course, he doesn't speak english.    if you are going for the "buffet"...it is not a true buffet where you can have what ever you like...the owner is waiting by the cash with a lid, and will charge you extra, when you didn't over stuff the container (the lid fits fine!)...he still charges you extra!!!   and charges a fee for using the debit machine...you must fill half the container with their greasy rice and tasteless noodles.DO NOT GO HERE!!!!....YOU WILL PAY $12 FOR A MEDIUM SIZE CONTAINER OF BELOW STANDARD FOOD!!!!
