This place was awesome! It's like a little mall for car rentals! The way everything is set up is pretty fool-proof with the rental agencies in plain view and signs everywhere. We hopped in a cab to go here, waited in line at an agency, sorted out our business, used their bathroom real quick (which is large and relatively clean - decent enough for those that just landed from the airport), went down to the garage, picked out a car, and -voila- drove off into the sunset. Easy peasy.They have a shuttle that goes from McCarran to this center and back. After you drop your car back off, you can just get onto the shuttle to head to the airport.
