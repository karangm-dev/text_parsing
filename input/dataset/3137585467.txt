We have been seeing Dr. Thurman for about 8 years now for all our pets. She is the most amazing vet and all of her staff are incredibly sweet and helpful. They've helped us with everything from routine visits, to puppy packages to even having to put down a pet recently. They handle EVERYTHING with the most amazing respect and professionalism. No matter where we move to in the valley I will always take my furry loved ones to Desert Sage and Dr. Thurman.
