This post will be at both locations. First off whenever I have any sort of issue with my mod all they give me are BS excuses. They are supposed to be "experts" but all they are are completely unqualified people who vape all day. Their juice is also over priced you can go to any other store and get juice 50% cheaper. I have a alien mod and it seems to not charge at all. So I bring it in and all they say is "ohh it looks like dust is in there that's why." I can tell you dust is literally everywhere they're just trying to get out from helping or replacing my mod. Also they are pretty rude and unprofessional to be honest. They were just giving me attitude when I said that they're just making excuses.
