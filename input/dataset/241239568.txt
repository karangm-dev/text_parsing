I found Paul's business on Google. As soon as I called, he was ready to help me duplicate my fob on the same day. Paul knows his keyfobs inside and out, as he knew exactly what model i was looking for and was able to confirm how the key looks by just me telling him the model number. The pricing is very reasonable especially since the keyfob works 100% flawlessly. Watching him copy the old fob to a new one was something new to me. It only takes a couple minutes. He is very professional, quick and honest. 10/10 I would recommend anyone else that needs a secondary keyfob to see Paul.
