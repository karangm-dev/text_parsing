I had the Kamayan experience on a Sunday for one of my best friend's birthday back in March, for a party of 9. Holy crap, the food was delicious. The chefs started off by painting different sauces (shrimp sauce, mango hot sauce, and some garlic sauce). Then they piled so much food on our banana leaves that I didn't think I would be able to finish it all! Some of the things we had: garlic rice, BBQ pork ribs, salad, mussels, fried chicken, devilled egg, fried milk fish. When the food came, our table was literally silent for a solid 5 minutes because everyone was too busy eating and enjoying the food. Everything was cooked perfectly, and the sauces complimented the food so well. One thing we weren't too happy about was how long it took us to get our food. Our reservation was for 7:30 but we didn't get the banana leaves laid out on the table until 8:30. We were starving and getting hangry :( However, with the great food, top-notch music, and excellent customer service (our ube dessert was comped for the birthday), I couldn't give rate his place less than a 5. There are after all, only two "food artists". Tip for when you visit: Maybe don't come with huge groups of people.
