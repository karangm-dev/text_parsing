Meh.I like the outdoor patio.I like the mojitos, and the mojito style lemonade.Service was AWFUL.  We were basically ignored for most of the time.I thought the food was meh.Meh.  The filet medallions with shrimp and bernaisse wasn't bad... but..... meh.The spicy sirloin sandwich with fries... it definitely wasn't spicy, and it too.... eh..... meh.I'll come back for brunch, to give it another shot.  I *really* want to like this place.
