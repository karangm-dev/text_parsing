This restaurant has me torn in regard whether to go back or not... I have been to Sapori roughly five times, obviously because the food is good. I get the Chicken Frances every time and it is always excellent.The issue is that I can't sit in the restaurant without hearing whining and complaining from the staff. I went back tonight (late afternoon). They were having issues with their internet and it was affecting their credit card / ordering system. I was there for roughly an hour and the manager sat at the bar arguing with the their provider the whole time, in total disregard of customers. She would get up and walk around the dining room area saying "why does this have to be my headache". It was uncomfortable and she should have handled that in an office as much as possible.The time before this visit the same manager was having personal conversations next to the water station where I was sitting. There was also an instance where they didn't change their "open hours" board that sits outside the restaurant. It said that they opened at 4 on Saturdays when they really didn't open until 5.We went in and the hostess said she wasn't sure what to tell me... We came back at 5 and ate. I drove by on my way home following week and they still hadn't changed the board haha!I honestly think that this staff really just doesn't care to much.I get the impression that ownership / general manager, if there is one, is worried about losing staff and not customers...
