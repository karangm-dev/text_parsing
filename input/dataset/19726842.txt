I went to Agra for lunch a couple of days ago for their lunch buffet, and I have been suffering from severe food poisoning ever since. The buffet is so extensive that I'm not sure how fresh all these items are, not to mention the desserts. I fell sick within hours of my meal, and still have symptoms 48 hours later. The food was tasty, but considering how sick I have been ever since, this is not a place I would recommend - I will not be visiting Agra ever again myself.
