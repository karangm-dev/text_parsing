I'm about to change your life in three words: Chile Relleno Burrito. First and foremost, everything at Chino's is exceptional. It's not fine dinning, but it hits the spot whenever I'm craving something out of the ordinary and affordable. Do you have the munchies right now? If so, stop reading and head to Chino's. I've been eating here since I was a teenager, or rather, I should say feasting here. The ordering style at Chino's leaves you with the ability to create your own meal. Typically, I choose the two item combo which comes with rice and beans. Now, you cannot go wrong with either the black beans or pinto beans. I have a hard time making that life choice between the two. Perhaps I'm biased, but I prefer their plain fried rice overall. Once those sides are taken care of, I make the first entree item choice of a Chinese food inspired meat. Honestly, they're all good choices but I find myself getting the teriyaki chicken most often. However, my next choice is where the real magic happens. Chile Relleno Burrito. Yes. Yes, you read that right. Now, Chino's Chile Relleno is amazing in and of itself. This is due to the delicious crunchy goodness that they surround their chile it in; I think it's crackers! Ritz, maybe? Delicious, most definitely! Now, imagine that wrapped in more cheesy goodness and a tortilla. Heaven. You've got heaven.
