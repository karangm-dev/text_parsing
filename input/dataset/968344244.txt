Hello Matthew, You are correct, when you came by our table we did tell you things were fine. If you would have checked with your staff you would have been informed that I did complain to the server that the bacon tempura was not good prior to you coming to our table. I would have thought that he would have informed you as the place wasn't to busy. We did hear him tell the kitchen staff about it. Plus if you had looked at our plates when you came to the table, I would have thought the pile of batter on the plate would have been a clue? If you didn't see it then you surly saw it when it was cleared from the table. I didn't fell it necessary to complain twice, your staff should have informed you, that is just my opinion on that. The other thing was the server did ask about a replacement, I declined. I also paid the bill in full without any compensation for an un happy customer. As for you being a small busy, I am trying to do my part for you. Our first meal there was great! This is an opportunity for you to hear from your customers and maybe take a look at things that need to be tweaked or changed. I wish you well.This is what Yelp is for to inform and hopefully help.
