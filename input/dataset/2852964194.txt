I have my High Speed Internet service though Primus Canada "bell dry loop" I originally went with Primus because they were one of the few companies that offered unlimited high speed Internet with no download cap.Well guess what! Not anymore, now they only offer 25Gigs cap,  modem rental  for about $48 a month.  Costumer service could also use some improvements "LIKE GETTING PEOPLE THAT SPEAK ENGLISH TO ANSWER THE PHONES" yes customer service in Canada should be in clearly spoken English.
