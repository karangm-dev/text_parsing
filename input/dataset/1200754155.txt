Worst experience, the food is extremely expensive but I didn't taste the quality of an expensive meal !!! I mean for 40-50 $ I can get amuck better steak anywhere else!!!! One piece of regular ribeye and mashed potato almost 50$!? And the quality of store bought meal !!  Our server Scott , not so friendly too!!! I felt like he treated us like we didn't belong there! He didn't bring me water when I asked for many times , if I could then I would have gotten it muse from the kitchen!!! What a disappointment!! Never again !!!
