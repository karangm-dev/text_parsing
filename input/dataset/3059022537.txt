My girl got the shrimp tacos and enjoyed them alot. They have a wide selection of hot sauces that you can select from yourself. They have fish taco tuesdays! I had a veggie burrito from here a while back and I remember liking it. They have a cool looking tree inside the restautant. The place has a cool vibe to it. So far my experience has been good.
