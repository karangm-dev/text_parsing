5 stars to the Nail Spa5 stars to Heidi, who does great work!  (And I am pretty picky.)7 stars to the guy who did my pedi and killed the foot massage.  OMG.  Great little salon...pleasant and lots of pedi chairs. Clean. I have been going there like clockwork, every 3 weeks, for over a year.  For a while I drove quite a ways, just to go to Mirage.Oh ya, and they have the massaging pedi chairs that really massage deep!Probably the best compliment I can give them is that I get many compliments on my nails and people ask me, where do you go?  who does your nails?Great job!
