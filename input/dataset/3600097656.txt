Clean and comfortable environment, very friendly staff from front desk to the dentists and incredibly accommodating. I started with a cleaning, then back for three cavities and ended up purchasing the zoom teeth whitening. This is not your typical dentist and if you are like me (hadn't been for longer than I want to post lol) and hate having work done on your teeth, this is the place you should go. There's even a little coffee room where you can make whatever you want or just grab a bottle of water!
