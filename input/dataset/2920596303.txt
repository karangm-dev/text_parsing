Came in on a Wednesday night at around 7PM. We were told it would be a 15-20 minutes wait so we put our names down and waited at the entrance. It took about 15 minutes to get seated. We got one bag of Duritos for free--they're sort of like chips. Puffed and seasoned with some spice and lime- addicting! I got: Gimme that Strawberry Margarita - Super strong tasting at first, and yes... Brain freeze is definitely an ingredient. It was tasty, refreshing and did I mention strong? Grilled Farmer's Cheese Taco - This tasted really fresh. One taco was good enough to fill me up because of the sides to got. Street Corn - Yummmm this was delicious. This does get a bit heavy after awhile but it's so good. I'd suggest sharing it, it was too much for me to finish. I ended up packing half. Beans with Crispy Rice - This was seasoned really well, it had a nice spice to it. I didn't like the really big chunks of rice in it but the smaller pieces spread throughout the dish really added to the beans because of the crunch it gave. I also packed half of this as well, the portion sizes were pretty good. I'm definitely coming back here. It's affordable, tasty and they're open super late on the weekend.
