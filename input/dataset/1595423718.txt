I've had many repairs done here, and admired their jewelry for years.They do absolutely beautiful, perfect repair work.  If another jeweler can't do the job, bring it here.  Their staff includes jewelry artists, craftsmen and designers.  I think they can do everything. They are also very nice, helpful and service is excellent.  I highly recommend.
