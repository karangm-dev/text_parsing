I wish I had something nice to say about this place. They have such potential and are so well placed to excel. I ordered the chicken burger sandwich, and for $16 you would expect something pretty decent. Unfortunately it was barely edible. Their drink menu is pretty decent, so I would return for a beer, but stay away from the food.
