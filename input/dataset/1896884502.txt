I went in there a few months ago, grabbed some OJ and a few things and realized nearly all were a couple months past due date. I went up to the cashier when checking out and told her, she was indifferent. I told her people may get sick so they should go check, then a man behind me chewed her out. He said it was always like this.Fast forward to last week. I was checking out and the same cashier was there. She said she had no change to give me for the 20 I was using to pay the 4.50 bill. I asked her if she could find change, she rudely told me to calm down even though I was VERY calm. She then opened the till and had a lot of 10's, 5's and change, then told me to calm down again that she would give me change (that she had  alot of). I told her I was calm then she snapped back, "Calm down". Then told me to calm down when I was walking away. I must say after walking out the door I got angry, she really got me worked up, which is what she was aiming for by her tone.I called back and complained to someone, but they said the manager was on vacation or something so who knows. Anyway, in this economy if people are not going to give good customer service there are always other places to go, which is what I've chosen to do. It's sad b/c this place is local for me. Thank god for No Frills at Dundas and Pacific which has very good service, and food that is not rotten.Oh, and I'm very calm thanks.
