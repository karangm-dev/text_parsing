Amazing hotel. It's more like a luxurious apartment than a hotel room. Almost a thousand square feet, it's very spacious. Full kitchen, living room and bed room with a balcony. We were on the 15th floor and the view was amazing. The hotel is very quiet. All of the workers are professional. I liked that they have both an indoor and outdoor pool. There is only valet but it's not $15 like other hotels. It's what you wanna tip the driver. It's only a half mile away from the strip so it's definitely worth checking out.
