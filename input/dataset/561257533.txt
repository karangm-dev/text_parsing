The staff is nice, but the food not so much.  I asked for a rare steak and got a medium.  I sent it back and the steak they replaced it with was between medium-rare and medium.  The first steak actually looked nice and seared, the second steak had no sear at all.  It looked like something I'd get at Denny's for 10 bucks.  Severely unimpressive for a $26 steak.
