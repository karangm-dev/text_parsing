Great work guys! I dropped off my vehicle for misfiring. Spent money on a diag, and they not only got my engine running but they fixed the engine knock "tick tick tick" that other shops were confused about for the past 3 years. Its amazing that 2 other Greulich's, and a Big O Tire could not fix that tick. Quick fix at Virginia and my truck not only runs great but it sounds like a healthy v8 for once! They have the tools and knowledge to get it done. You get what you pay for. If you had a bad experience here it may be because you don't understand how a car is supposed to be maintained or how an engine even works. If you want it done once and good bring it here. Thx Zach C. for referral and the Tech who fixed my baby.
