Way too expensive here, charging 2600 and up for a puppy? No thanks, I'll keep looking elsewhere. Sales lady we had was very pushy, kept saying we could finance through them. They have to get commission for selling animals.  She didn't even seem to care what type of environment the puppy would be going to and kept saying that my husky would immediately get along with any puppy.Also, saw a dog eat it's own poop in one of the glass windows.  Doesn't seem like they take care of their animals here. Some puppies were sleeping on each other and she just grabbed one of them and said look at this puppy!Very disappointed, hopefully this place will learn to price more fairly and will take better care of their animals.
