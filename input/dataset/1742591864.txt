Great outdoor eating, but very pricey. Had 3 sandwiches (Italian, tuna, and egg salad) with pasta (oily not tangy) and fruit salads (bland and soggy). The sandwiches  were good (and hearty) but not really great. Drinks were outrageous (nearly $3 for a drip coffee and nearly $5 for bottled juice). After dropping over $60 for 2 adults and 2 kids, I'll go to Joe's Farm Grill next time in in the mood for something similar.
