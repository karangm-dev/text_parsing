The Pad Thai was way too sweet and Heavy. I would stay away from that dish. We tried a unique and fun dish (24A) which comes with meats and veggies and rice paper so you can create your own rolls. Tons of fun. The meat on the other hand wasn't so great. The BBQ Pork tasted very processed and the beef had no flavor. I will return and try the Pho and Subs. I have a feeling these Vietnamese staples might be the heart of their business and be better quality.
