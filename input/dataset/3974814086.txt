This easily could be the best patio in Scottsdale, and the food is really good, too.  There are some booths inside if you want to get out of the sun. On a Saturday afternoon before the party got started I saw some dogs taking in the sun on the patio, too. It's a good place to hang out for awhile. Misters make the patio bearable in the summer.I recommend either the burgers (there's short rib in the grind so there's a lot of flavor, and the one with bilstered jalapenos has a burn that's not over the top) or the chicken sandwich with goat cheese. The sweet potato fries tasted fresh.
