Service was excellent. The owner was very friendly and kept bringing us different small dishes to try which was a nice touch and very welcoming. Atmosphere is unique but a bit dark and airy. Unfortunately I am only giving this place 2 stars because I was not at all impressed with the food. It was very bland and our meat dishes were served  lukewarm which I find a major turnoff when eating out. I will for fairness sake temper this review with the fact that I rarely appreciate Moroccan food and typically find it bland and uninteresting compared to other genres of middle eastern cuisine. The owner truly seemed like a genuinely nice man so I wish him well with his new endeavor. If you're a fan of Moroccan food it may be worth giving a try.
