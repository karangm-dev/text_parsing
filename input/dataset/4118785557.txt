I have to write this review now because I've never seen anything like this place.  I'm here today, going on about 2 hrs, because my husband rolled his ankle on a sidewalk. This place is a zoo. I don't know if it's the only urgent care around or what, but there must have been about 20 people+ constantly sitting and/or coming through the door. The lobby is hot and stinks. Just feels so unsanitary! I had to use the restroom and that was a joyful experience as well. The lock on the door was broken and missing so you could get a nice peep show through the hole. Also there were wads of wet paper towels stuck to the walls. So disgusting. After about an hour and 1/2 we get called back. I'm not sure if a doctor or an arnp saw my husband. She didn't introduce herself. Took about 5 min to examine his foot and ordered x-rays. That was fine with us. The quicker the better. But we sat for another 30 minutes waiting for x-rays. My husband is finally getting them done now so we'll see. I can't imagine I need to say anymore then I have.  All I can say is this place is really unorganized and filthy. Not sure if the e.r is any better but it can't be any worse then this place.
