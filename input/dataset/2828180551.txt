Our puppy, Athena, LOVES going to camp. She goes two days a week so that we can get her energy out instead of keeping her at home while my finace and I are at work all day. She pulls us into the office when we get out of the car and cannot wait to get to play in the play areas. When I watch her on the cameras she is almost always on the ground wrestling with the other pups. I love that this facility exists! The staff is great and the results I get when my dog comes home are amazing and so worth the cost. We do the 20 day package which makes the cost per day very reasonable. As far as the reviews regarding the dogs getting sick from day care, when a dog is around that many other dogs you are going to increase their risk of getting sick. CBW made sure we provided them with our dog's up to date records and vaccines. Also, they clean the facility all the time, watching the cameras you can see they do it fairly often. It seems like they take all the necessary precautions to keep the dogs safe. To us, it is the same thing as taking your child to day care or school, they are more prone to get sick but that doesn't mean it is not a good thing for them to go.
