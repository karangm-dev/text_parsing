Not very good at all. We went for dinner. The decor was lackluster and the food was below average. The service was very good. We were convinced our very old waitress was a former show girl. Only go here if you if you got for free. There are much better buffets with more favorable food, more variety and better decor (ie: Wooden Spoon at Cosmopolitan and Paris Buffet). Was very disappointed and expected more.
