I went out on a limb and it worked out Great!  I read the reviews, the location was ideal and when I walked in I was greeted with a smile, friendliness and willingness to answer my questions and the same thing happened when I picked up my iPad.   The screen had been smashed from blunt force, not just a drop.  I originally thought, this was it..new iPad needed based on how damaged it was.   Nope!  Great Price, Great Service, and finished in a couple of hours AND I was able to take advantage of the YELP deal!   I won all they way around.   Nothing fancy here, just four walls and good people.  I used to go up the road but found it to be about 20-25% more expensive than Phoenix IPhone Repairs.  Now I found the right place to take my iPhone and iPad.
