They changed the menu since I was here last. The Phad Thai was not as good as I remember. My mom ordered the eggplant with chicken, it was okay, she said she would not order it again. My husband ordered the Beef Green Curry extra "Thai hot". It was very hot, however they skimped on the amount of Beef in the dish. It should be called a Vegetable green curry with a Beef garnish.There were only two servers for the whole dining area, they were overwhelmed due to a large group of 15 people, the service was slower than usual.The place is cheap and clean. I'd recommend the satay chicken for an appetizer. Overall it's an okay place...it's the Thai food restaurant in Sun City. I'd miss the old Line Thai, maybe they got a new cook?
