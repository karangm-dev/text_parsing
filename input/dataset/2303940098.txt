I personally tend to overlook this goodwill for some reason even though it's closer and a bit less "sketchy" than the one on 16th & Indian School (i.e. Not so many tweekers lurking around. Can I say that?!?!). It's not as big, or as busy, and as such I always seem to find a gem or two here. This time it was a brand new black leather Fossil belt (exactly what I've been looking for!) for $3 - yay! And a slew of bonsai pots - those babies are PRICY to buy new!  The staff here are great too, always in a good mood and happy to see you.
