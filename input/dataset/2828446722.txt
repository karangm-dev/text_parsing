I recently moved to Las Vegas from Connecticut  and have been missing a really good bagel. The bagels there remind me of the ones I used to get back home. Their breakfasts are delicious including their very tasty coffee. And if an amazing  breakfast isn't enough for you, visit their bakery full of freshly made sweets of all kinds!
