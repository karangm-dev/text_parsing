This is our new favorite spot! The food was great, I had the chicken pesto sandwich and yum! It was delicious. My husband had ribs and wings, both great. The grilled corn is amazing too. I am not a beer drinker but our server Ryan noticed that I like Frambois and suggested some different beers that were really good! We will definitely be going back!
