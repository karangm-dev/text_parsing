I worked with Gregory who installed a home theatre for me a few months ago.  He was always on time and reachable.  He also brought in folks to take care of electrical and drywall components of the job.  I am writing this now because I was researching Yelp for another job and remembered the great work they did and wanted to leave a well-deserved review.
