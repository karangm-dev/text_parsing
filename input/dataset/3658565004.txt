This is still the only place I take my dog. My boyfriend took notice how much I rave about them that we took his dog to get his nails trimmed. It was his first time and we were all nervous. But once again, Mike and the staff took such great care and kept his dog calm. I haven't taken my dog to any other place but here since my friend recommended it.
