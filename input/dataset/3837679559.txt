Soda fountain galore.After my half marathon, off we went to get some ice cream. Me oh my, ice cream? Of course I'm down for it!And we entered Sweet Moses. A soda fountain from... some older era. 50s? 60s? Nonetheless, I'm a sucker for old fashioned restaurants (thus the reason why I love old school diners and what not). It looked like it totally could have been a pharmacy of some sorts. Sweet Moses is a unique place- you walk in, greeted by the old fashioned gadgets, a display full of chocolates, and their own homemade ice cream, as well as their own root beer (which is surprisingly made by their own root beer syrup plus carbonated water...I never realized pop is always made this way. haha).We split a regular size root beer float...which happened to be huge. But oh man- it hit the spot. The root beer was great, the ice cream on top was amazing.... Mmmmmmm. Glorious.
