I was faced with replacing a water pump on my Bmw 6 series. I took my car to numerous repair places and the repair prices were astronomical. I decided to repair my car at Sin City Auto Repair. I repaired my car there and was very satisfied with the facility, the tools, and most importantly guidance from the owner Jordan. Jordan assisted me throughout the process from ordering the parts, to assisting me by showing me how to do the repair. I felt proud and I repaired my car and save a ton of money. Jordan is very knowledgeable and I found him to be very friendly and accommodating I would recommend this business 2 anyone who is thinking of doing their own repair whether it be a simple oil change or something more in detail Jordan is available to assist. I give Sin City Auto Repair two thumbs up .Warren
