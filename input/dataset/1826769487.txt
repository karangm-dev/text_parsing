My daughter Sofia has been receiving Physical Theraphy for over a year in this location. I absolutely love it. The staff is always friendly and very understanding. When we first started we got assigned to therapist whom my daughter did not get along with, we asked to be changed and they gladly did. Miss Katherine has been such an amazing therapist always attentive and acknowledges my concerns and needs. not only does miss Katherine makes us feel comfortable and welcomed but the rest of therapist. I highly recommend this place.
