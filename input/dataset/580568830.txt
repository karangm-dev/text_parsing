I have been very pleased with Palazzo Townhomes and their property management staff.  When looking for rental options from out of state, Shane was especially helpful making sure that I had all the information I needed and pushing my application through as quickly as possible since I was on a short time frame.  Our apartment  was very clean and ready for us to move in when we arrived.  We really enjoy having an attached garage and balcony which gives it less of the "apartment" living feel.  I also appreciate that we were able to do a short term lease and have the option to go month-to-month at the end of the lease term.
