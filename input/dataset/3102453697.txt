I have been searching for a place to get good crepes in the valley for years.  We have tried many places with high Yelp ratings and although they are good, they just aren't as good as the ones I've had at Paris in Las Vegas or the Frenchman with a crepe stand at the base of the Telluride ski resort in Colorado.  Finally, we have found THE BEST CREPE place in Phoenix!   We drove 45 minutes in from Chandler and would love to see a Crepe Club open at or near Chandler Fashion/Downtown Chandler....pretty please :).Manager is wonderful and very friendly.  Only 2 comments for improvement is to replace the cloth booth seats with leather or vinyl so they don't stain and fill the fruit crepes with just a tad more fruit.  Chicken Florentine crepe, strawberry short crepe and my daughter's biscoff amd nutella waffle were mouth watering.  Service was fast and there was a steady stream of people coming in the entire time we were there on a Saturday afternoon.
