My last allergy shot was in May as I was switching jobs in June and knew there would be a few weeks where I didn't have insurance coverage. However I just received a bill stating I went in for an allergy shot on June 16 when I definitely did not. I called the billing company and I think they are now being flooded with calls since the office is now CLOSED. The lady at the billing agency made it sound like they were receiving many calls like mine (aka being billed for services not received).  I am also trying to get my records and serum...total nightmare!I did some research online and Dr. Ispas now has a full practice in Virginia....thanks for abandoning your Arizona patients!
