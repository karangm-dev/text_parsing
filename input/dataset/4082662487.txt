We tried the is restaurant when we were new the area and craving Mexican food.  We were in a hurry and wanted something fast since our toddler was sleep deprived an on edge.  I walked through this restaurant's doors with low expectations since it is a fast food place.  The food was average, at best.  It was very greasy and had a lot of over-processed imitation cheese.  I would go back if I were completely out of food and all the other restaurants in the area were out of power.   Let's hope that scenario does not happen!
