Over a year ago, the company that employs me changed office locations. My colleagues and I decided to check out restaurants around the area. We found this gem less than a huge Mississauga block away from our office building.The food never fails me. I love the sandwiches there (the roast beef and chicken are my favourites). I have a weakness for quiche, with the broccoli and ham varieties to be my go-to choices. I also love soup that you can get as a side with your meal. I love the beef and barley vegetable, and the minestrone soups.The interior is cozy. There is a fireplace (think it's fake, but I could be wrong), a large marble table, a huge London-inspired round clock on the wall, and many tables and seats at the back of the restaurant. I recently tried a mojito smoothie, which is wonderfully tart and made with almond milk. So good! If you need a pick-me-up and have to go back to the office with a non-alcoholic drink, try the mojito smoothie!
