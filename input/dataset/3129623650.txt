Interesting that this place closed. The one in Jersey where I lived was packed at all times. I can say perhaps it was the youngsters working here with the attitude of not wanting to serve. Walked in and was the only person there and I could see that I was clearly an annoyance. Not just the waitress but even the person behind the counter -I suppose he was the cook? Food was ok but customer Service is probably what caused this location to close.
