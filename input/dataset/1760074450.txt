Fairly new establishment as I'm told. Plenty of seating all around for drinks or light dining. Dimly lit, great surf rock tunes, and fruity drinks = a great time. 5 stars and hats off to bartender Bosco! For his attention to detail and GREAT local recommendations. When sparking up a convo about the city since I was only in town for a short time he personally mapped out a handwritten must do list around town.Come get your grog, collector mugs and fun all in one spot. -Cheers! Shameful Tiki :D
