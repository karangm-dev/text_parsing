This is about the best Mexican food in Las Vegas!  The staff is nice and friendly, and the owners are totally involved in the daily operation. Frank is generally interacting with customers and Fina is managing the kitchen. The recipes are very tasty and will bring you back for more. I agree that it is a bit more expensive than some other Mexican restaurants, but it's totally worth it.
