Hands down my favourite piercing establishment in the city.I've been pierced by both Jessie and Six. My first visit, Jessie pierced my nose. She took her time to make sure I was comfortable and the placement was done well. Least pain I've felt on any piercing. It's been 8 weeks and my nose has healed with zero complications. I'm so happy with it. My second visit here was after another store botched up my ears and navel and Six was lovely enough to remove the ear jewelry for me and guide me in how to heal my navel. Super professional and very nice guy! I came back and had him do my snake bites, and I'm so glad I decided to have him do it. Seriously DO NOT CHEAP OUT ON PIERCINGS. Six was super precise, took his time to make sure the placement was perfect and you can tell he's really serious about his craft. The discomfort was very minimal and the piercings look flawless. I'm not going to risk having my piercings botched anywhere else ever again just to save a few dollars (not worth it!). Exotix is primo (and a wide jewelry selection!).  You really do get what you pay for here. Thanks so much guys !!
