I have had great meals at Red Robins, but my experience at this location was awful. We chose to go to Red Robin because of the "bottomless fries," but when the food finally came (After 10 minutes waiting for our server to acknowledge us, and 40 more minutes waiting for our meal to come), the fries were cold. They weren't lukewarm, they were cold. This is after we specifically requested that they bring us the fries before the meal. Our waiter said that their policy is for fries to go with appetizers first and then, if there are any extra, they can offer refills or pre-fills.  By the time I got a decent order of fries, I had literally been in my seat for over an hour. They claim to have bottomless fries, but when the place is busy, fries are so scarce, you're lucky if you get more than a handful with your burger. I'm usually not one to complain, but this location has lost my business. In the future I'll either consider going to the location on Stapley and US60, or I'll find a Smash Burger.
