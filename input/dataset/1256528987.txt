We ended up going with silk flowers for my wedding due to our limited budget. I was skeptical, but so pleasantly surprised. My flowers turned out beautiful! I only needed bouquets and boutonnieres since my venue was supplying center pieces. We did calla lily's and mixed in other random flowers that were our wedding colors. They have these fake flowers that look and feel like real flowers, everyone thought they were real. Some of the flowers we used I had to go get and bring in myself since they didn't have something that matched my colors to my liking, but they do have a large selection, I just picked difficult colors to match. I brought in ribbon to wrap the stems with. We dealt with Betty. I brought in a couple pictures for inspiration, gave her some ideas and let her do her thing, and they were so much more beautiful than I had ever imagined they could be. If I can figure out how to add pictures, I will.And compared to fresh flowers, the price was very reasonable. I requested a cascade bouquet for myself, which tend to be pricey. The total price for mine, 3 bridesmaids bouquets, and 6 boutonnieres was the same as it would have been for only my cascade bouquet if I'd gone with fresh flowers. So extremely pleased!!
