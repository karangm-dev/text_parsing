Stay away from this place! The front cashier Allie never smiles or says anything and is like a robot! Whoever Linda is covering for the nice girl who had a baby is a power nightmare ! They are discriminatory against white girls them both being Latina! Also they wouldn't give me a refund for a $20 pair of pants cause some cat hair was on it?' Serious hating animals too!! I called, emailed and NO call from the DM Miriam! I can see they care about no one! Watch out I see a class action lawsuit with this kind of behavior ! Hmmmm
