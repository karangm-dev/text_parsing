I'm a recent first time home owner and was looking for someone NOT NAMED Best Buy to come and help me with some home theater setup in my new home.I heard about Infinity HD through a promotion called "Our Town".  I called and scheduled a time for them to come and install my HD TV.Justin and crew showed up directly on-time and where friendly and courteous when installing the setup and boy does it look great! I would highly recommend Infinity HD to all my friends for any of their home theater setup needs.
