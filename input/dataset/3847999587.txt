I was introduced to the Peppermill by a good friend who is a Vegas local. He brought me here for the first time in May 2016. Now on my 6th Vegas trip of 2016, I've made it a point to come in and have breakfast at least one of the mornings I am here. I've come to Vegas with different people on most of my trips this year and have always brought them here and they enjoy it too. Love the casual, fun ambiance and culture of the restaurant. Can definitely say my favorite meal is the French Toast Collage and a nice big Mimosa from the bar.
