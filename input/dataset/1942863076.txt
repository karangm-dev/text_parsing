Horrible man working there at night. My fiancé got into a car accident at the light there, and I left home to get there and check to see if he was okay. He was outside this Circle K, so that's where I pulled up to park. The man who works there had walked outside and says "Hey are you planning on buying something?" Excuse me? There was enough parking spots for 4+ customers to pull in and park at once if anything, and how rude. I responded by saying I was there to check on my fiancé, and he shook his head and turned the other way. Really? I just barely got there. I can understand that it might be irritating if all the parking spots were taken, but it's late at night and not one customer around, there was plenty of parking still and I'm checking on my fiancé's well being. That's the first thing he thinks to say to someone? Have a heart man. Seriously, it makes me sick how rude people can be. I will never get gas from this place ever again.
