We were looking forward to a real deli on the west side of Las Vegas.  However, we were disappointed.  I would think that when a restaurant opens it would put it's best foot forward.  This place stumbled.Four of us recently came to Canter's for dinner.  We ordered the potato knish.  When it was finally delivered to the table it resembled the frozen knishes you could find at Smith's Supermarket-not a real knish.  What was worse, it had been cooked (or fried) so long that it was as hard as a rock and we had to send it back.  We ordered a brisket sandwich.  One of the things that sets brisket apart is that it is juicy and moist and cooked slowly for a long time.  The brisket we received was so dried out that it was almost inedible.  We ordered a corned beef sandwich.  Corn been, regular or lean, should also be juicy and moist.  The corned beef we received was so dry it stuck to your tongue. We received the sandwiches 40 minutes after we ordered them.  The restaurant was almost empty at the time so a delay was unacceptable.  We never received pickles or the cole slaw which should come with the sandwiches.  We asked for a manager to explain the situation with the hope that positive criticism would help the place.  No one was around who we could talk with.  We left almost all of the food, paid, and went some place else for dinner.I would think a new restaurant would pay attention to detail, have a prepared kitchen staff who knew hoe to cook the food, and provide at least a modicum of service.Great expectations dashed!
