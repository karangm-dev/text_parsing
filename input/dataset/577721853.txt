My entire family has been using Tony's services for over 10 years. They are the best.  They run a super efficient shop and we get top quality service!  One quick story.  Our Ford Expedition was having engine knocks. and I took it in to Tony's and expected to be hit with a big repair bill.  Tony called back and said the problem was the gas cap.  I had lost the original and got a replacement on the internet. Turns out it did not have a proper seal and resultant caused the engine knocking.  Only charge was for a new gas cap.  Once again...Tony is the best!!
