The Wildflower Bread Company is actually a local chain whose headquarters are in Scottsdale. They reached out to me for my previous mediocore experience and so I came back to give it a second chance. It's nice that they care about every experience. I had exceptional service my second time around. I ordered the V12 Kale salad, "organic baby kale, a mix of 12 vegetables: roasted Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, red peppers, eggplant, red onion & tomato tossed with fresh carrots, celery, jicama, zucchini, petite peas, dried sweet organic corn, feta & sunflower seeds with Mediterranean Vinaigrette" but I wanted the dressing substituted for a different dressing and they listed all the dressings to me, we chose a couple and they each gave us each a plate with the different dressings on the side, that was so nice! They were also kind enough to split the salad for us.Later since we like English Toffee Pudding (it's a really moist cake) we ordered a slice of their Old Fashioned Toffee Tart but it was not to our liking at all so I went back up to the counter to ask if we could return or exchange it and the manager was happy to let us exchange it, we chose a slice of the Carrot Cake which was very good. Also, I noticed our finished plates were rountinely picked up from our table, which was also excellent so things did not pile up. And I also noticed the manager helping out serving and working at the cash register which was great to see.Lastly, the cakes have a label with a list of their ingredients so it was nice to see some transparency. Great establishment! They geuinely care about service.
