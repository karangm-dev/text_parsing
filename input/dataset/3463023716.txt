So, if I had written this review yesterday, I would have given the place 5 stars. I was treated for a leg wound by a wonderful PA, Misty. However, today I had some questions about the wound dressing.  I called and was told that Misty wasn't on call today but that the on-call doc or PA would call me back. That was over 5 hours ago. They close at 6.  So I called back. And was told that HE was "too busy" to talk to me. Really?  I will call back and talk to Misty tomorrow. I know SHE will call me back.
