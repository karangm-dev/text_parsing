Extraordinarily Ordinary:We went mid week and it may have been an off night, however ...Excellent service, pricy bar and menu, and not so good meal.Meatballs were small, dense and dry. Chicken Mediterranean was overlooked, tuff, and dry. Garlic overpowered sauces and seasonings.The Lemon cake was excellent, but the Tiramisu was bland.
