We made the mistake of going out for brunch at 2 pm, which seems to be the a no-no in Charlotte. So I see this sign that says "breakfast served ALL day" and I figured out perfect!Our first visit there (and last) I'm trying to figure out the menu. I ask the waitress "it says here all scrambled eggs" can I have sunny side up instead?". She says "Of course, anyway you want them other than hardboiled!"Five minutes later I decide to order the "dawn breaker" special with fried eggs, the waitress says"no that one is only available with scrambled eggs and you HAVE TO hurry up because the kitchen closes at 2:30""someone could have let us know before they sat us down, outside it says ALL day"  she answers "but it doesn't say dinner!"  Good move dummy trying to win an argument with the client. I tell her ok but I want the eggs lightly scrambled not well done.And of course I got scrambled eggs so overcooked they were hard enough to be hard boiled, and the bacon was MIA from the plate and the country potatoes were frozen. The reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 is because when I told the waitress that no, the food was not good she got the manager who came over, inquired and adjusted the bill. It still came to $11 for a salad and two coffees but I was not in the mood to go over the bill.When I stepped outside there were several dark grey streaks of grease from the seat on the back of my left calf, luckily I was wearing shorts. WTH that really takes the cherry.
