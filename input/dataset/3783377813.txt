Tazza is located in Bridgeland, and is owned by a Lebanese family, who are an awesome bunch of characters! They know all their regulars by name, and have a very family like atmopshere.This is the closest to homemade food you can get. I really love the fatayer, they have spinach, chicken and beef. I also recoomend the kibbeh, and tabouleh salad. There's small area to sit down and eat your food, as well as a patio, where they have some small shows in summer.
