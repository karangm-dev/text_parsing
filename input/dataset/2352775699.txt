Worst experience ever!!! Walked in on a Saturday after saw online no need for reservation just come on in and there WERE NOT ENOUGH WAITERS to seat people so there were 18 parties ahead of us waiting and we were told it was a 2 hour wait. Meanwhile there were many of bays open!!!! The way the staff handled the situation was awful! They were clueless and clearly had no idea what good customer service was. The guy at the desk said "if our servers come in at 11 then we can start seating people... as in he wasn't sure if his employees would show up? Wtf Then a bachelor party came over to us and told us they had been waiting for 2 hours!!! Who wants to do that when they are there for a party! Worst service ever! As a tourist I've been to many top golfs Vegas being one of my favorite and it get 10x more people then pitt and they still Some how manage to make everyone happy! Get it together Pittsburgh we weren't coming for food all we needed was a bay and someone to click start!!!!
