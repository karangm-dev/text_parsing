Stopped by here late night to get take out. I was starving but wanted to get straight to bed. Ordered the burger medium and it was fantastic. Thick patty, garlic aioli, and melted cheese (not sure what kind). And, the fries were perfect. Once the staff realized we had just gotten married (hence the wedding dress) they tossed in free dessert. The oatmeal cookies were some of the best I've ever had. Not a cheap late night eat, but well worth it!
