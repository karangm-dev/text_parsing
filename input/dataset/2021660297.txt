Our little fur baby Gizmo came to Pete & Macs for his first Spa Treatment and I couldn't be happier. His cut was exactly what I wanted, Rachelle was really good and patient with him. I've read about dogs getting a bad cut so I was a little worried but I was quickly put at ease when he walked out looking like a million bucks. I watched other dogs get groomed and both Groomers were very sweet to each pet, doing things at the pace of each pet instead of themselves. Pete & Macs is our Puppy Spa.
