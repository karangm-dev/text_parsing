Nothing but trouble and headache since the day we moved in.1- Management usually shows you a model unit, you almost never get to see the actual unit you will live in till you sign the lease and physically move in2- The day we moved in To our actual unit we realized that it was a big mistakeA- the patio was covered in dog piss and a very strong odor that took months to get rid off, although never went away completelyB- the shed in the patio was full of rodent feces and he a very strong odor - you would think they would clean that stuff prior to moving anyone in to a health hazard and unsafe conditionsC- Two days after we moved we realized that we had roaches infestation problem at the apartment, although management was responsive and sent pest control multiple times, the problem still persists today (12 months later)D- Next door neighbors had their trash outside all the time, full of dog feces roasting in 100+ degree and management didn't do much to stop it - problem still persists todayE- A lot of things started falling apart, blocked sink, toilet, AC not working, patio door latch not working, I lost count, although there is an emergency number and maintenance folks are fairly responsive, this is not the kind of place we thought we were signing forOur lease expires this month and we can't wait to get out of here, but of course management decided to give us the goodbye surprise and insist that we pay for the full month even tho our lease ends and we will physically move out on the 23rd - not only that but they insisted that the additional prorated week has to be prorated based on a higher rate (month to month) rate.
