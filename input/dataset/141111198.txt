This little cottage is tucked away in the back.  The sign is easy to spot.The owner is always so helpful in finding what we need.  There is a room of wall to wall high quality spices and herbal teas.  Our favorites are cayenne, tumeric and Hawthorn berries.  For teas we tried the chocolate chai, kiwi/strawberries, hibiscus, mint and dandelion.  If everyone were to drink medicinal teas, we would not have so many people on pharmaceutical medications who need more compounding medication for the side effects.  I really believe in ancient remedies.  Anyway, this one little cottage has everything you need for wellness; from literature, resource books, herbs, spices, alternative medicine and knick knack novelties.In the back or the main house  you will find practicing naturopaths, massage therapists, colonic machine, infrared sauna, etc.Worth a look see!
