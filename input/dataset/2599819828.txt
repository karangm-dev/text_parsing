I have been a customer of Looking Glass Window Cleaning company for 10 years...and with good reason. The team headed by Abraham are thorough, courteous, professional, clean, timely and protect my things when they come to do a job. They are such a pleasure to work with I have used their services for our offices. It's amazing to me how they are able to get the windows completely clean even after the worst sand / pollen / rain storm. Thanks Looking Glass Window Cleaning and special thanks to Abraham!
