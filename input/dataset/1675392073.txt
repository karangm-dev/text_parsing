We found the Yardbird while walking through the Venetian on our first day. The smell and atmosphere is what drew us in. I wasn't feeling anything too crazy so I got the "open-face" chicken salad sandwich and it was amazing! I took the leftovers back to the room, ate some that same night, and the rest the following night for dinner. That's how big and delicious it was! I didn't want to waste any of it. My boyfriend ordered the swine burger and loved it! We also tried the mac and cheese as an appetizer and we were not disappointed. We really wanted to try the peach cobbler but we were stuffed, so went back for brunch two days later. I got their biscuits and gravy. It was good but so much food! I'm not OCD about my food touching but I would've liked the eggs and bacon on the side instead of on top of the biscuits, so maybe keep that in mind if having your food touching bothers you. My boyfriend got the brisket sandwich and enjoyed it. To finish our meal of course we got the peach cobbler and ate it all! I'm from Texas but had never had peach cobbler. I'm not a fan of peaches but the cobbler was delicious! Overall, I would recommend this to anyone wanting southern food with a twist. You will not be disappointed! My only regret is not going back and trying the Elvis pancakes. The staff was also great, so props to our servers.
