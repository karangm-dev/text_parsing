I went back the other day to try them again, thinking it would be better then the first time.... My first review was filtered out, for what reason?  I left a poor experience, I guess. at any rate I tried again.... Pretty bad, the salad was brown  and the dressing was impossible... why do they edit these bad experiences out of yelp?  You have to wonder.
