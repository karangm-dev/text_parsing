We had high hopes, I had the stromboli lunch express, the meat was cold inside and the bread tasted like it had flour on it, another had the prosciutto panino and the meat was fatty and bread would not hold together, another had cheese ravioli appetizers was greasy, cold, and tasteless. Also the menu says 6 ravioli and we only received 4. The salad was nothing special. I am not sure how Maui has anything to do with the place. Finally the lunch express is promised in 10 minutes, we waited 20.
