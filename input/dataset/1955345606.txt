Starbucks like all fast food outlets have the same quality food and drinks wherever location you go so I'm not commenting on what I eat or drink here. If you go to any Starbucks you know what you're getting. But what totally sucks and borders on the unethical is they don't tag prices on the food products on display. So you don't know how much it costs until you've waited in line and asked at the cash register. I asked the cashier why this is so but she had no answer. Is this some kind of trick? Are they saying if you have to ask you can't afford it?
