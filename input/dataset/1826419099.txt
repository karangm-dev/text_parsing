I came into pizza hut placed an order with the girl at the front desk I paid and waited 30mins when I asked was my order ready I was informed that my pizza order was not when put in. I had to wait all over again. While sitting there 4other people orders where completely wrong. This is the worst Pizza Hut ever. I will not recommend anyone to order here. I will not be back
