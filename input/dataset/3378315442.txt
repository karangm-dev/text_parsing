Absolutely amazing!!! Service was good and quick. New favorite spot in Arizona for brunch. So many food options and healthy breakfast for good prices. Fluffy omelettes and fresh fruit/veggies.  Bloody Mary's are on point too. Great Atmosphere.. Cute patio and interior design. Definitely check it out if your in north Scottsdale
