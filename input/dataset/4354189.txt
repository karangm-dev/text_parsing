Hearing about Il Tetto & seeing it for the first time gets you very excited. Then you talk to the people who work there. I have tried it three different times & every time the experience is the same. I have asked several other people their opinion & they agree with me. We went up there waiting for our table at Sienna Mercato & are always treated with disrespect & eye rolls. They act like their tables are gold plated reserved for royalty. It also takes ten years to get a drink at the bar. The tables are always dirty with other people's drinks. It's definitely not worth going there. Next time I will go down the street to Seviche until No Wait says my table is ready. If they don't cleanup their act they will close. The bad service baffles me because it is so great at Sienna Mercato & Sienna on the plaza. I heard mezzo is great too. Il Tetto, get your act together & Fire your surly hostesses.
