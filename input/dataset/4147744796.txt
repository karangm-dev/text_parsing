Everything about the place is outstanding.  I disagree with many of the other users' gripes about it.  From what I've seen, I get the distinct feeling that many people don't properly tip the staff.  It was spotless, my room was huge and beautiful (even though I booked through Hotwire) and the staff was first-rate, polite and respectful.  It is the best hotel I have ever stayed in, full stop.  I'm staying at another "four-star" establishment in Montreal this weekend and I will be surprised if it is even half as nice.
