This is my favorite restaurant in Tempe. We have been eating their since they were at the corner of University and Mill Ave. We were so happy when they reopened at the corners of Southern & McClintock. We used to walk to the old location, but now we have to drive a few miles, but it is well worth the drive. The family that runs it is awesome and we have become quite friendly with them.
