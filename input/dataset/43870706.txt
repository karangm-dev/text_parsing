I've been to this  Davisville location 4 times and I've been disappointed 3 out of the 4. What prompted me to write a review was my experience today, the worst thus far: Only 2 other people in the store when I came in, 1 waiting for their drink & the other had just finished placing their order.  There were 3 staff members, and another on their lunch break. It was clear the guy making drinks was training.  After taking my order ( frapp with bacon breakfast sandwich) team member A at the register proceeded to stand there & chat with team member B while the guy training was left to make drinks alone.  I get my sandwich, 2 new customers come in. A takes the order & goes back to chatting with B.  New guy makes all hot beverage orders, ignoring the fact I was there before 2 others, then asks B  how to make my frapp.    Finally get my order after 11 minutes & as I'm leaving see the team member who was on break jump on the register & tell A (who is still just shooting the shit with B) to help with drinks.  I get outside, take a better look at my drink & can tell the consistency & color are all wrong.  Take a sip, disgusting, but no time to go back.  Get on the train, open sandwich that's now cold, take a bite & the bread is stale.  WTF? I'll stick to the Royal Bank location or go to the Tims across the street where 12 bucks will get me a lot further.
