I've always loved Fired Pie and still do. This location however is horrible. I was tempted to take a video of the guy who was putting sauce on the pizza for like 5 minutes (not even joking). Everyone working here was doing things so slowly not understand how long ppl were waiting in line. Will never come to this location again. I am writing this review at the restaurant after waiting for 40 minutes just to order and another 10 min to get the pizza. FYI there were only 7 people ahead of me when I came in.
