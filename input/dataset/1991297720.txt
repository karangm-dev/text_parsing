The food was fine, the portions huge!  So if you are a big eater this is the place for you.  They give you soup with your entree, which is simple but very favorful.  The owner wife is rude and abusive to the staff, shouting at them in the dinning room.  For me this uncalled for and make dinners uncomfortable.  Other wise my meal was good.
