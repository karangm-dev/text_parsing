Yes the food is very good but it's nothing with bad service . The girl who was serving us last night was extremely impolite . We were a party of 7 and every time we would ask for something she would give us attitude . she never asked us if we needed something . I wouldn't have been so mad if she didn't get mad at me for asking for a spoon for my spoon .. She gave us 6 spoons for ice cream , so I asked for another one and she scream " what do you mean , I gave you all of them " ... You don't yell at your customers !!!!  Plus on top of that , we got charge 15% tip on top of our bill . She deserve less than that . If I ever got her again I would ask for a new server ' I'm mad about the service
