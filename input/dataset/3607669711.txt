Loco Patrõn is my favorite Mexican restaurant in the valley. When I first tried Loco Patrõn I wasn't expecting it to be great, I figured it would be typical bar food. But I was blown away by how delicious the food was! The presentation is fabulous and the service is always prompt. It is a great place to take your friends or family. I highly recommend it!
