6 of us from the USA took the 3- day East Canada Tour Oct 10-12, from Take Tours, but handled by Compass Holidays.  Our tour guide/driver were Benjamin & Randy. I'll make a separate review on that.  On our return trip, our drop off was to be at 477 Dundass W in China town, where we were picked up.  BUT a new tour guide came aboard & replaced Ben (he had to get off at the Richmond HIll drop off.  His name, we were told, is "Young."  Well, on his own, without consideration  for the remaining passengers, he decided to tell the driver to drop us off in Spidina, infront of Motel 8 & HSBC.  To our protest, since we made arrangement for a van to pick us up @ Dundass, he responded it's only 5-minutes walk - dragging our suitcases, right???.  UNACCEPTABLE!!!  He added, if he were to drop us off @ Dundass, the driver will go over his time.  Is that our problem - seriously??? What kind of customer service is that.  "YOUNG" Should NOT BE ALLOWED to be EMPLOYED/work in a SERVICE-ORIENTED Business.  I think he IS missing the point of who is putting "butter on his bread!" With an A..HO..... attitude, he should be fired!
