Bob...I am sorry, Bob....I really did want to love you, but I just can't. Let's start with the really friendly service and the old time quaint country atmosphere.  Both are a real plus.  Your old place is really special find in today's chain restaurant world.We started off good, the service, the atmosphere, the soup, yummy and the salad fresh and good.But then the main course comes and I am sorry Bob, but sour tasting pork chops and just as sour baby back ribs is just not right.  I tried to determine the flavors, I got the rosemary and I think the meat was marinated too long in a red wine vinegar type marinate.  The nice waitress could only confirm the rosemary.  But Bob, both portions (which were really nice sized) were just to sour for my and my wifes taste buds.  I really did want to like an original place like this, but sorry Bob, I just can't give you any more than 2 stars for now.
