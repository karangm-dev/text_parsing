Food is good, lovely ambiance. But disappointed in cleanliness. During our second visit we were served a cup with lipstick on it. On the third visit, there was quite a bit of dried fruit next to the drinks menu. The waitress was justifiably grossed out and cleaned it up, but after the previous visit... i think they could step up their game a bit.
