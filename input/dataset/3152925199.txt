I've eaten here twice now and loved it! The guacamole is delicious and made right at your table from whole avocados, fresh cilantro, onions, tomatoes, and jalape√±os. The servers are very attentive, replenishing your warm chips faster than you can eat them. Great atmosphere, good prices, and several vegetarian options. I plan to return on a Monday for their 95-cent tacos!
