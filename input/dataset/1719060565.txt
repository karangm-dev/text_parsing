Was wanting an ice cream place that didn't serve soft serve and wasn't a chain.  I Googled 'the best ice cream places'  in Arizona and Mighty Moo came up and saw all the positive reviews.  I took my boyfriend there and we were amazed with all the flavors they had to offer and how damn good the flavors tasted.  I ended up telling two of my other friends about it and we went again the next day.  The banana cream pie and sweet corn raspberry swirl are delicious!  Would recommend this place for sure if you're looking for a unique ice cream joint.
