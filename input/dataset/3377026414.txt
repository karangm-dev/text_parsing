Stopped in for lunch with brother & buddy and had the 3 roll lunch: tuna, crispy California & yellowtail + salad for $11. Bro got crispy California & crispy bagel, buddy got garlic beef plate & spicy tuna. Lunch was good and prices ok but 2 of 3 (myself, buddy) got food poisoning, both missed work today. He called to warm them, will see what he says....most likely won't be going back....
