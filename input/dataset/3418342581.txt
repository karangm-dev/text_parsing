I will give this place 2 stars just because they have FAYGO pop 3 for a dollar.....Besides that the Deli sucks and I wont be back because for 7.99 I can do better with my money....Really I expected better than a overpriced cornbeef!!!!The chip selection is good and beer selection is decent....After a days work I want something better than this place I went out on a limb and got screwed....I went back to 56 miles on a empty stomach because I through the cornbeef out the window!!!!
