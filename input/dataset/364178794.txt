Worth the wait! Get there early to avoid missing the good stuff when it sells out. My husband likes everything on the menu. I recently tried the turkey sandwich and sausage. Both were incredible. The staff was super friendly and helpful. They gave out free samples while we waited in line and checked on us several times while we ate. Even gave us sauces in to-go cups to take home with our leftovers (always order enough for leftovers!)
