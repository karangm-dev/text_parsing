My husband brought me here for our 2nd year anniversary and I love the ambience of this place.  That includes the music and environment.  The food was amazing.  We ordered the truffle fries and it was great!!!  I ordered the spicy seafood pasta and my husband ordered the amazing chicken and rice au gratin.  The cocktails were awesome and we had a great night.  The service was fast and the waiter was very pleasant to talk to.  It wasn't pricey either which was a surprise given the amazing service there.  This is a definite go!
