I had this company come to put new air ducts in my home they changed me $2900.00 3 months before they where to complete the work. I was like whatever so I scheduled the appointment 3 months in advance. Come appointment day no technician shows up. I get a call telling me he's running late. I'm like ok. Around 4pm someone  shows up at my house. tells me they forgot to order the parts.he says I'm going to do your winter service on the ac. Works on the unit in the house takes the bolts out of the gas shutoff tells me they are missing. Never looks at outside unit. Now gas valve still have no bolts. So next day they show up at noon with parts then everyone leaves except one guy. The guy says they have to wait for the installer. The installer shows up at 4pm says we need more parts before we can install. Tells me we may be back tomorrow. I was done. Also I used Sierra at my rental property. They inspect my ac tell me it needs new blower motor and would $2000 to fix. I call another company they replace a circuit  board for$300 and ac works fine.  So they over charge don't stick to appointments. Generly don't care for the customers. Now my job is not complete let's see if they issue my refund.
