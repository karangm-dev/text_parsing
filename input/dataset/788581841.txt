The staff were nice enough, but we really felt like they were price gouging us. We knew there was an issue with the wheel bearing/struts of our car, so we took it in to have it inspected and to get a quote on how much it would cost to repair.The inspection was $45+tax, and took about a half hour. They quoted $1250+tax to replace the wheel bearings, and drive shafts. We felt this was excessive, and after checking Yelp we decided to go with Four Wheels on Wolfedale. Four Wheels did all the repairs for less than $800 tax included! We also got a third quote from Canadian Tire for $900.Save yourself the money and go elsewhere!
