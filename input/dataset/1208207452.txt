Since opening i've tried countless combinations and their staff was extremely cooperative with my wacky but delicious creations. At Ted's they have a wide variety of fishes and fried foods to choose from ranging from fresh fish to salmon skin and fried tofu. All really fresh and the fried foods are actually crunchy compared to other sushi burrito places. I've been coming at least 3-4 times a week and it never gets boring. definitely recommend the burdock roots!
