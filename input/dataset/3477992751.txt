I could eat here everyday for the rest of my life and die happy. Was on Diners, Dives and Drive-Ins for a reason.This is a hole in the wall location, but the food will blow your mind. JADE RED CHICKEN QUESADILLA. So good. My first time going there, the cashier wasn't too busy and helped me by recommendations and letting me sample different types. Plus free cookies with your meal? The snickerdoodles might be better than my mom's. I live 2000+ miles away now and whenever I go back home to visit, this is ALWAYS a stop for me. Doesn't get much better than this. For you AZ natives who are scared to give it a try, it's worth it!
