I didn't know I liked french toast until I tried Cafe Moulin's!For breakfast I'm usually a sweet over savory kinda gal, so I opted for the WALNUT ST. FRENCH TOAST. It was not too sweet at all.. so yummy.. I did add strawberries on top too!  There doesn't seem to be much seating, so I could see wait time being a problem because it seems to be a great breakfast/brunch spot. Good thing I came on a Tuesday morning so there wasn't a problem, but a decent amount of people came in during the time I was eating.This was my first visit and I will definitely be coming back to try their waffles or crepes.
