I went to this location twice in the past week and everyone looked miserable who worked there. Panera has always been pretty consistent to me with what  I order but I'm a little blown away at the lack of customer service at this location. I didn't see anyone smile! They didn't have the options of what i wanted available but didn't tell me until after i paid. When i was trying to talk to them the girls looked at me like i was speaking a different language. They need some work here.
