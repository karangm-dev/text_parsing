Horrible customer service they are  over price sold me a 1.05 oz bleach the one time use packages for 6.95 and the label marked 3oz . If I had known the price I would've bought the larger tube for 5.99 .  Call back to ask about the miss label item and she said no that the price . I would nvr go back . The lightened wasn't even that great .
