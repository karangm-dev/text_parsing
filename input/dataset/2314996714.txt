This show is a gem hidden in plain sight on the Vegas Strip.  My friends and I came to Las Vegas for a rousing bachelor party weekend, heard about this show, and found ourselves falling out of our chairs in laughter while also being amazed at the talent.  This is by far the best way to spend an afternoon in Las Vegas.
