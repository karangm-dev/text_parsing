Memo arrived on time andexplained what he was going to do, then confirmed that is what we wanted. He was very personable.  Polar Air should be proud of this technician as he did an exemplary job representing the company. He expained all options for potential A/C service and provided a quote.  We will definately use this company again because of Memo's excellent service and skill.
