I am a new patient at this office because Jessica Gdovin, PA-C, moved here from another office. I have been seeing Jessica for my annual exams for the past 3 years. Jessica has a wonderful, kind and caring bedside manner. She is knowledgeable and thorough. I feel very comfortable talking to her about any female issues I may have. She is non-judgmental and truly cares. She is truly amazing! The rest of the staff has also been great! Everyone I have spoken to on phone and in person has been kind and helpful. My thanks to the entire staff for a great first experience!
