I stopped by this morning to pick up a latte and a muffin on my way to work - it was around 10am, so long after the morning rush (if there is such a thing in Harrisburg). I waited and waited and waited for about 5 minutes for the barista to stop flirting with a customer who was in front of me - they were basically just chatting - then I threw up my arms and left. I want to support local business as much as the next guy, but at least I know if I walk into a Starbucks, I can get in and out in 5 minutes.Skip this place, if you have anywhere to be. Got time to waste? This is just the place.
