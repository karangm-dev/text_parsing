Not a big fan of this place... The food is OK nothing impressive or there is not much varsity of food. It is just that it is pricy. I came on Saturday for friend bday and I end up paying 40 buck for a meal. That is alot. I never paid for all u can eat this much. The food is decent I really like the mean and chicken which they cook fresh. They have ice cream machine which I like as well. The sushi is not as good if u want sushi go to all u can eat sushi no here .
