Gallo Miller is one of the best auto body repair shops I have ever used! The friendly, knowledgeable staff makes getting your car's booboo fixed as painless as possible. They are booked several weeks out, but worth the wait if you can. They coordinate with your insurance company, complete the work as promised and you get your vehicle back beautifully repaired and clean! It is obvious that they really care about the customer, how refreshing!! They do not take credit cards, but they let you know that up front so you can be prepared to pay your part when you pick up your car.
