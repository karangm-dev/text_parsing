I have been coming to see Alicia for almost 2 years and have always been very happy with her work. Alicia is fast, meticulous, and very talented with nail art and is able to do any design I have requested.  I usually visit Christina for my pedicures and I love every minute! Christina has great eye for detail and is always concerned with her clients' comfort. I have visited other technicians at Embellish Nail Salon and have never had a negative experience.
