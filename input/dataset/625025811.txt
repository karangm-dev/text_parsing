Used this company when we needed a pool pump replaced. No problems. Work was done quickly. Now looking for tile cleaning and chemical balancing. Spoke to someone who was out in the field and said they would call back. Didn't happen. Left a message and tried contacting them thru their website, and still haven't heard from them. 2 weeks later, moving on.
