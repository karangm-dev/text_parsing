In the 8 years I have owned my mountain bike, I have had to take it to at least 5 different shops because each one has closed or merged with another store. When I last went to go visit Adventure, I was literally mortified that they had closed but saw a sign on the door stating they had moved to Action.However, upon my initial visit, I was not impressed. I came in to buy a spare tube and it literally took me a long time to find someone to help me.  Additionally, when I got to the repair counter to ask for a quote on a tuneup, the technician was on the phone and did not acknowledge me (Not even, "I'll be right with you).After this experience, I will not be back.
