I called the hotel at 6:29 to tell them I needed pickup from the airport and was told it would be 20-30 minutes. After 45 minutes I call the hotel again and am told it will be 5 more minutes. Finally at 7:26 the van pulls up. Three more minutes and it would be an hour that I waited for the shuttle. The driver is rude and we continue to sit at the airport and wait 15 more minutes. By the time I get to the hotel I have been in pit for nearly two hours, severely cutting into an already limited rest period which is slightly crucial for the people working your flights. Horrible customer service and a waste of time.
