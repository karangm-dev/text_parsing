By far my favorite place to stay in Vegas to this date.  I've stayed at other hotels including Encore and would rather stay here.  Their "all suites" rooms are seriously awesome.  The bathroom is very large and they've got TVs in the bathroom, bedroom, and living room area.  I also like that their sunken living rooms as it makes the room feel even larger. They've got a great selection of shops and restaurants including Bouchon Bakery which makes awesome pastries and Parisian Macaroons.  How the Venetian scored this place instead of Paris Hotel is certainly a mystery, but it sure makes the Venetian a better choice!  Pool area is set up like a typical European Garden.  Wish they had real grass instead of turf as that is really hot to walk in during the summer.  Also, the one large pool gets very crowded which made me question the cleanliness of the water, but it was fairly relaxing regardless.  It's nice that they have various areas with beach chairs that are smaller so you don't feel like your at the pool with 1,000 people even though you are.  They put a lot of thought into the architecture of the place as it is very Italian, and very romantic.  The check-in staff was great and upgraded us from a smaller suite to a larger one for free.  I hope to stay here many, many more times!
