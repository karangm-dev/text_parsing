We started our sheltie off in day care to help her with socialization.  She loves it!!  She cannot wait to get to each visit.  Kelly gives her a lesson every day care session and is now giving her private lessons. Kelly loves her job and her clients and it shows.  She listens to our concerns and zeros right in on the solution. A well trained dog is a happy dog (and owner).  This is the place to go.
