We had our wedding here on 9/28! It was absolutely gorgeous and perfect! Chastity and Christie were rockstars. Everything was keep on time and I never saw any issues. The whole staff was great! We had an issue with getting our room credit with MGM front desk and Chastity fixed it right away. I highly recommend this location to get married at.
