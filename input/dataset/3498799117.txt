Hands down the best hot dog I've ever had! It was so good I even went back and got a second one! I flew to Charlotte from Arizona for a bachelorette weekend, and these hot dogs were definitely part of the memorable experience.He had so many amazing choices including creating your own with a variety of toppings and sauces. Vic was incredibly personable and friendly!
