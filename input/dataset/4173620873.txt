Ice cream was okay.  Loud rap music blasting with lyrics about drugs and violence.  Next song about hoes and banging them.  So loud you couldn't hold a conversation. A bunch of teen boys around a table making gestures, some obscene, to the lyrics, who didn't even buy anything.  Two teen girls working who seemed oblivious,either they were afraid or enjoyed the music.  Not a family friendly atmosphere.  They will loose all their business if this continues!  Very disappointed of this atmosphere.
