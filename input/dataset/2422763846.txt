i was going to get a membership since i had one the last time i lived in vegas and it was great (07) however the store has changed so much... everything that i used to like is now gone... they used to have killer black angus roast beef-goneoreida mozzarella sticks-gonebakers and chefs penne and pickles- gonenathans hot dogs- gonenot to mention that all the prices are ridic high compared to say food4less or marianas or cardenas market....maybe ill check out costco, def not worth it...OOOOO and one other side note.... they sell "nathans" hot dogs in there food court but dont have them in the store? and there is nooooooo way in.... that those are nathans hot dogs.... trust me. overall overpriced, not worth it, and crappy.
