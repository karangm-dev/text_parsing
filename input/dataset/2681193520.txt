Ate here on a whim since it's right on the corner.  They had an outdoor table right away.  The menu was big, lots of choices, including many vegetarian, local, and organic.  The food was fresh with good serving sizes.  I had the avocado brie sandwich and my husband had the vegetarian Singapore noodles.  Both dishes were great.  They serve Mill St. beers and the prices for everything (food and drinks) were exceptional.The only odd thing was that we didn't have one server.  It was unusual but all of the waitresses helped us and someone was always available when we needed them.
