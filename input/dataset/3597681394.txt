Joe drilled my new Storm "Drive" ball this morning. I am impressed! It's the best fit of any ball I've ever owned. First ball I rolled was a strike and I rolled off a 640 series (non-league) the first 3 games! Love the ball but LOVE the way it was drilled even more! This guy is REALLY good! Very happy! Very Very happy~!
