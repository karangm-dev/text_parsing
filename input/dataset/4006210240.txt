Liz has been cutting my hair for over a year now and I am always pleased with the results. She takes the time to understand what I am looking for and gives her professional opinion about my cut and color. I don't live anywhere near this salon but it is worth the drive!Just a side note- In the past, I had always experienced stylists either gossiping with each other or complaining about stuff when I'm getting my hair done. I have NEVER experienced this with Liz at this salon or when she was at Cutting Image. It is nice to just get your hair done and be able to relax with Liz.
