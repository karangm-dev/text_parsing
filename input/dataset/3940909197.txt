It was that time of the year when I needed an inspection.  I decided to take it to Snyder's ExxonMobil in Carnegie.  BIG MISTAKE.  After having it for almost a whole day, and having to call in because I was wondering what was taking so long, they told me that I needed over $1800 worth of work done!  I was completely shocked.  I wanted to get another mechanic's opinion so I took it to Greentree Autobody right down the street in Carnegie.  They called me early in the morning of my inspection date and estimated I only need $450 worth of work.  Huge rush of relief ran through me shortly followed by anger at Snyder's for trying to completely rip me off!!!!  They told me I needed all new tires when that was not even mentioned by Greentree Autobody.  Something like that isn't unfamiliar territory to anyone that knows even the slightest about cars.  Do not waste your time or hard earned money on these scammers.
