The agent Nga allowed my family to miss out on a house due to unprofessional behavior! My name was ran through public records, and it just so happens to be a very common name. Without using a middle initial pulled up multiple public records and before asking for proof submitted by my agent or myself submitted that to the homeowner who then denied my application! These public records were not even me! On top of that I followed all the instructions that were asked of me and STILL was denied due to the lack or proactivity from this agent. I am is shock at the negligence of this agent. Now I've lost a home for my daughters and myself and am stuck in a unhealthy environment with them.
