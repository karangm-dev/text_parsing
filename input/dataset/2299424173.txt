This place is for suckers. They put pictures of cars online that they don't really have. That really really irks me. We had a salesman before we even got out of our car. He immediately started lying through his teeth. This place is a joke. I have no idea where they get their prices from. Jacked up thousands of dollars. I highly do NOT recommend.
