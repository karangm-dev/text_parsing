Horrible service ! We made a reservation for 5 . Got there on time they sit us in the back corner. We were really excited since this place had a 4 star rating  and we were starving . As soon as we sat down seemed like the manager/server I think he's name was Jamie told us they're expecting a party of 16 and asked us if we could move to a round table that they were starting to set up for us . We wanted some quiet time to enjoy our meals and the table they wanted to move us to was in the front of the entrance where everyone walks past you. After we told our server that we'd like to keep our seats he said okay but you have to get out before 7. In the most rude way possible . The food came right away . We ordered shrimp and calamari appetizers which were delicious . I ordered margarita flat bread . I would say it wasn't that great . Lamb chops were overly priced for 3 skinny blend pieces for $33 . What a rip off!  Eggplant was amazing but very similar to the lasagna . Everything went cold in 5 minutes. Overall bad service . Even the hostess seemed unwelcoming ((.  Their service left me with a bad taste in my mouth!
