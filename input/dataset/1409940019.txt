Was here this morning and needed a new part for the toilet. I believe it's called a flush valve. I took the one off my toilet to match up with a new one at the store. I got to this location, and looked for a sign that said plumbing. I didn't see one, so I asked an associate. He directed me to the opposite corner to which we were standing. I got down the plumbing aisle and couldn't see the part I required. The original part that I had was 11 years old. I guess they've made improvements to it since. I pushed the help button, and an announcement was made over their P.A. system. I waited for about 5 min. someone finally showed up. The employee working just came and shut off the call button and started to walk away.I said to him I need, he didn't let me finish my sentence and he rudely walked away saying he'd be back.I waited another good 10 minutes or so and decided I was going to go to Home Depot instead. On my way out the door I ran into the employee that originally shut off the call button. I asked him if he could help me now.He said yes, and that he was helping another customer at the time. We walked back to the plumbing aisle, with yet another customer that had stopped him on the way back from the front. We got to the plumbing aisle and the other customer was helped with their inquiry first.I was then finally helped with the part I needed for my toilet.I wouldn't say the customer service I received today was very good.No apologies were offered. It was like the employee was bitter because he was the only person in plumbing.I would have handled it differently forsure.
