Went on opening day and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Our waiter had a few kinks with the ordering system and they didn't have all of their menu items available but I'm not going to nitpick.The place was decorated very nicely with a clean modern look. The patio area also looked good but I don't think it was in use yet. It was very spacious inside and the tables were not cluttered like in many other restaurants to seat as many as possible. The menu has lots of great sounding options and they have a good variety of freshly squeezed juices. The food was incredible! I ordered 2 eggs with sausage links and my girlfriend went with the breakfast quesadilla. We were definitely not let down with the food. They have nicely seasoned hashbrowns which were outstanding! The pancakes were also amazing! Portions are huge and prices are reasonable. I will certainly be coming back.
