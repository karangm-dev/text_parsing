Disappointed and sad.  Why advertise farm to table and yet not explain anything about your culture and principles.  We had a business dinner for 10 people.  Wait staff was not invested in our experience and certainly did nothing to make us return.  The $46 ribeye was one of the toughest pieces of meat I've had.   Maybe we were eating retired and repurposed milk cows?  Salty and over seasoned, I would swear the steaks were tenderized with papain.  Most folks didn't finish their plates.  Cleveland has a great food scene...unfortunately this place isn't part of it.
