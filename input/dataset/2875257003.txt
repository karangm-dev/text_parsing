Tahoe Springs refuses to close my account after a disagreement in charges. They have left letters stating they will report me to the police if I do not pay and return equipment. They have left these letters on my door for neighbors to see. The letters say I have stolen their property. Others letters state I will have my account reported to the Credit Bureaucracy. They have charged me every 2 weeks although I have not received services nor had "delivery attempts" at my home for a year (+/-) . The driver would text me begging for payment. The company refuses to stop emailing. I feel very harrased and uneasy going to the company to deliver their equipment. Due to the hostility and overall unprofessional experience, we left messages asking them to come pick up equipment  (since they are billing for travel) and I would get a receipt the equipment was returned. They never responded but still harass me through sending invoices with bi-weekly increased amounts. I asked via email to stop contacting me, report me to the credit bureau, and close my account. They responded saying they will continue to charge me unless i pay my balance. I stopped payment because I did not agree with the charges. I am pleading for help.
