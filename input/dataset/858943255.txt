Probably driven by along hwy 7 a million times and never noticed it.  But boy am I ever happy for yelp or I would have never found it! Very small family owned restaurant - probably only a handful of tables with an unimpressive decor outside and in.  The food portions however are ginormous and great value for the price.  I was pleasantly surprised.  My friend I both ordered the olde village big breakfast with 3 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausages, 2 pieces of ham, potatoes, toast, pancake, French toast and a piece of fruit with coffee for $10.99!  One big platter with the eggs, meat, potatoes and toast came first.  We were already shocked by the food portion we completely forgot about the second giant plate that came with the pancake and French toast sprinkled with lots of cinnamon.  We obviously couldn't finish our food.  We are two little Asian girls that have a big appetite but this was definitely out of our league.  The owner was very friendly and came out to see if we enjoyed the food and encouraged us to pack it to go.   Will definitely be back!
