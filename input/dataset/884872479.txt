I can't believe I've never written a review on this place, even though I've been there 2-3 times each time I've visited Montreal.In my opinion, they have the best chocolate croissants! Their almond croissants are really good too. It was actually what initially attracted me to this place, but the last time I had both croissants, I liked the chocolate one slightly more. Plain croissants are good, but not the best.Going to be visiting soon, so I'm looking forward to having my fix it croissants and also try some yummy desserts everyone is talking about.
