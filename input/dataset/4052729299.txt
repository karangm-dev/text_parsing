Was so looking forward to some shroom pizza and a visit to UNO. The only time we get it, is when we hit the Dells or IL. This visit really sucked and was super disappointing. Walked in. Waited at the host stand for 5 min. I get it the host was busy. He was sweet and eventually seated us. Thank god he got our drinks. We sat there for about 15-20 minutes before our server finally came over. She just seemed really non chalant and we asked to order. She was like, oh ok. After sitting there for that long we knew what we wanted. Pizzas were okay. Seem to take awhile for two little pizzas. The n√∫mero UNO had hardly any meat on it. The shroom was good. Our server asked if we wanted to box it up to go because it looked like we had our hands full with our toddler. We were both like, no, we'll eat it here. Our toddler was just hungry. He did spill his milk. I asked for some extra napkins. Those came way later.I asked for the tab before we were done. Again, that took forever.we had our card out she left and then sauntered back. Everything just took a super long time when it didn't have to. I usually tip even with bad service at least 10 percent, but this service was just terrible and the inference of asking us to box our food up and leave was just the last straw. Maybe it wasn't meant that way, but it was the last straw. There were kids acting worse than ours with spilled milk and no napkins to clean it up. Yes, we cleaned it up after the 2 napkins finally came .Such a disappointment!
