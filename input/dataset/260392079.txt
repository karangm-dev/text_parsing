I tried Pink Cherry when a girlfriend of mine recommended it. I had never waxed before and was a bit scared to. This place and the ladies that work here are super amazing! They make sure you're super comfortable and at ease. The shop is so adorable and the whole experience is fabulous! I'm a regular now and I don't think I'll ever try another place for any of my waxing needs. This place is nowhere near where I live, but totally worth the drive!
