My hubby and I celebrated our 13th wedding anniversary here and we had a wonderful time. Amazing and unique was our server, Alejandro, who made us feel very special.   You can tell Alejandro is very proud of his workplace and the food here...and yes, our food was delicious! Will definitely come back here for the food and to see Alejandro again! He is a celebrity in the house!
