I can't believe I've forgotten to review Krissy.Let me keep it short and sweet.Hands down, THE BEST make up artist and hairdresser.The ONLY ONE I trust for VERY important events, like anniversaries and special occasions. You'd have to be crazy not to get her services. Very professional and dependable.
