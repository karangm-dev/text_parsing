We stopped in to have dinner here. I had to send my pizza back because it had incorrect ingredients on it, the second time it was missing ingredients. We were still charged for all the extra toppings. By the time I got my order the rest of the party was done eating. The chicken Parmesan marinara sauce was very bland. The decor is dated and the dim lighting does not hide that. I would skip this restaurant.
