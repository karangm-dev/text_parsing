I am a tattoo family member. One of the first 100. They have gone so far down hill it's incredible. The bread is always soggy. The fires undercooked. The servers rude on another level. This place peaked 4 years ago. I got my tattoo covered. Never going back. Not worth the wait or your time. It's a shadow of its former self.
