We were really excited to try their BBQ after seeing it highlighted on DDD. I'm originally from Kansas City and have a love for great BBQ. The drive from Gilbert took about 40 minutes and I was not disappointed. Mike and Bill took care of me and recommended the chopped beef and collard greens. Both were delicious! I've not had collard greens before and really liked them. Looking forward to the next time I visit this excellent restaurant. Thank you for taking care of me.
