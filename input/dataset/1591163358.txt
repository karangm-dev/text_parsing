We went to Parsley for lunch today and I was not disappointed. The staff was very helpful and even let us taste a couple things. The portions were generous and the food was healthy with many vegan choices. I ordered tha falafel bowl and my sister ordered the tuna wrap. We also tried the fries which were very good. I will be back.
