I called and made an apointment to go in to have my oil changed and to check out a noise coming from the back of my truck.10 mins before schedueled time I arrived and went to the desk to check in. Was greated by a very rude man who went on to tell me he has too many cars and I am going to have to wait hours. Then he proceeded to look in the computer to see my sheduled apointment and tells me there is nothing he can do about it. Get it together..and if there is an issue try not being rude to your customers..very unprofessional and they have lost me as a customer. Very unsatisfied.
