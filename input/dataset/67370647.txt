Ambiance is amazing & with the island music playing you truly feel like you're on vacation. Jessica was so unbelievably patient while we figured out a color combination that would be perfect!!! She truly went out of her way to make sure I was happy with the final product... And I AM!!  Zena was so welcoming & made my regular nail appointment into a lovely little getaway.
