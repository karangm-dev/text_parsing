I really like guy on TV. So we were going to vegas i wanted to try his restaurant, glad i did. The place was busy so we sat outside, hour wait for inside.our waiter Chris was very nice ,friendly and he checked back on us regularly. I had the sashimi tacos(they r under the appetizers.) 4 tacos was a meal.  People with me had a hamburger and turkey sandwich (can feed 2) that was huge. Food was great. My only suggestion is some fans on the outside( it is still hot) and it would help keep the flys out
