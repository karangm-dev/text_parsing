if I could give these people no stars i would.  they are bunch of liars and  con artists.  DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE!!!  i started monthly service for lawn and pool maintenance  with them 2 weeks ago they and promised e they will service that thursday.  I called them and asked if they did  they told  me yes since i live in LA i sent my brother to check what they had done and they had NOT touched a thing! I called  them back i told them they didn't service anything and they said ohh we made a mistake we will be there wednesday and still no service again i called the they tell me they have serviced my pool and lawn but not even one leaf is touched!!! then he proceeded to insult me by saying that they did service and he will cancel my service because he didn't need my "little house" These people are unprofessional and don't deserve to be in business
