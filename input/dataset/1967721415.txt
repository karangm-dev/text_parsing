Presley is my go to for hair.  I get compliments all the time on my hair.   Ive been seeing her for over 3 years.  Now all of my family now go to see her.   She is very professional and loves doing color.  She's open to anything but will always make sure my hair isn't compromised in the process.   I love changing it up.   I promise you will not be disappointed she is fabulous.
