Stayed a few blocks away at a hotel on business. I like to do the local thing when I'm away from home so I looked for a local hike (dreamy draw was awesome) and I ALWAYS have local pizza. Stumpys was awesome. Generous toppings, awesome crust, fast delivery. Good stuff. If I come back and stay all the way on the other side of town, I will drive back here for another pie. Got a half works, half cheese and jalape√±o. Never did that before. Definitely doing it again. On another night I went to SNY just to get some variety and perspective on Phx area pizza and it was a total let down. Stumpys was closed so I had no choice but next time, I won't deviate from the best. I may even try one of the highly recommended specialty ones.
