I have had such a GREAT experience with Duane!  He has been ultra responsive on the house we own (and rent out) in Scottsdale.  He has performed all the work expected, and the tenants like him too.  I have recommended him to friends...that is how great he is.  I noticed some negative reviews (which surprised me), and they only thing I can say about those is that he does seem busy...but I think that speaks to how great he is that so many people want to hire him.  It is hard to find a great handyman, and Duane is just that.
