I haven't had a yelp account until now, because I feel like too many people are quick to complain, and quiet to compliment. I always understood that if you didn't have anything nice to say, you shouldn't say anything at all. I'm about to say some very positive things. I've been coming here for over a year since I moved in down the street. They're convenient, open all the time, and have good coffee. I'd eaten here a few times, but was never astonished by their food. Never astonished, that is, until tonight. From what I am to understand, the menu is receiving a much needed overhaul. Look at my pictures for things to come. They've recently brought in a local chef, Nick. Surely, they spared no expense to get this guy to cook for them. Some friends and I came in, all ordered different things from a list of recommendations by the guys beyond the counter. The food was FANTASTIC! I'd have expected to pay double for meals like this. Lots of flavor, lots of color, and from such friendly folks. I'll be coming in and eating a lot more often, needless to say. Can't wait to see these people continue to make food into art for my friends and myself.
