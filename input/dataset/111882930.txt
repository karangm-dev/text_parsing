Lamesa was one of those wonderful unexpected experiences you don't get from a restaurant on these days. We happened to walk in randomly on a Sunday and experienced their Kamayan 'Hand-ti-Mouth' Sunday dinner. It's $40 per guest, but the attention, effort, quality and pure deliciousness level made it absolutely worth it. Everything is served on a layer of banana leaves and the two chefs plate the many components before your very eyes, leaving you with an artistically plated feast before you to devour. Take a moment to appreciate all the colors and textures, and get ready to eat! They start with four sauces, each packed with different but well balanced flavor. For example, their mango hot sauce doesn't just bring spice but also sweetness. You spend the meal pairing each bite of food with the four sauces to obtain the maximum tastebud adventure. The food itself is purposefully varied in both texture and taste. I can't tell you which bite was my favorite. Maybe the tender mussels cooked in coconut sauce, the crunch of the fried chicken adobo dipped in the mango hot sauce, the lettuce wrap with lechon and slaw as a fresh palate cleanser, the sweet char of the brocollini, the fall off the bone pork rib in a sweet sticky sauce, that creamy center of the devilled egg, the subtle sweetness of the cornbread.... you get the idea.Also, did I mention you eat all of that with your hands?  Get in there and have some delicious fun!
