Not sure if I needed a new cell phone battery as it had been draining really fast. So figured who better to go to then BATTERIES PLUS. Walked in and began to take the battery out and asked if he could test it. What a battery store that won't test to even see if the battery is bad, wtf?  I then asked if he could sell me one and he said sure. Ten minutes later he said he doesn't have one but I could go to one of the other madison stores to get it.  Or I could come back in a few days to pick it up.  He had to count on his fingers to figure out how many days, really?  I asked if they could send it to me, guess what?  NOPE.
