What? I've never left a review for my favorite spot?? Oh where do I start? Ok, the Bandera margarita. It's the best marg I've ever had. Three layers like the Mexican flag... madori on the bottom, pomegranate in the middle and regular on top. Now, I'm not usually one for frozen or sweet marks but this is it. Even the house margs are fab. Food.. chips and salsa rock. Lots of shrimp entrees to love. Fajitas are bomb. Tacos de pescado rick, the shrimp stuffed pompano is one of my faves. Hubby usually gets the ribeye, used to be on the menu, but now a special, marinated in cascabel sauce? It's great. Love sitting on the patio people watching. Good food good margs good times.
