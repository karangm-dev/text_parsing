This is the kinda place that makes me angry as a consumer. Let's charge twice the price for a plate of food that a normal person couldn't possibly finish... You know that phrase your mom would say when you wouldn't finish your food? "there are starving children in Africa..." I'm sure the amount of thrown out food at this place could cure world hunger over night.Service was OK. Flavor was OK. I've had better $2 bloody Mary's in Virginia beach than what they charge you $16 and claim to be "famous". 24 on zagat is more for the exaggerated plating than it is for a good quality meal. Not going back.
