Just ordered delivery last night. I ordered a medium three topping pizza and a large calzone, which was $36. Way over priced! Then I opened the pizza box, only to see that the pizza was mostly globs of over bearing cheese. All cheese and hardly any toppings is a no go in my book. I just moved back to Chandler and I will never go back to this pizza joint.
