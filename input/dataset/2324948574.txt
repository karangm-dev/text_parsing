CHOOSE A DIFFERENT AIRLINE!Initially,  I was a fan of Allegiant.   Early on , my extended family used it to get to Vegas from the Midwest.  But in the past year, Allegiant has failed miserably in delivering on time performance, bags, customer service , and cancellations.  Allegiant is not a large enough airline to be required to provide on time performance data, but on my last two trips to the Vegas airport, the information boards only showed ONE Allegiant flight that was not delayed on departure.   Not weather, not ATC, but all mechanical issues.  If you are willing to risk delays or cancellation,and view an airline trip as a rapid long distance bus ride on aircraft that are not up today's standards for technology, Allegiant is an option.   If you value on time performance, and expect some measure of good customer service, choose a different airline.
