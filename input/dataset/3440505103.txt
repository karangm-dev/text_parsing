Toms is located in NYNY which we are staying at. It looks great from outside. Greeted by a friendly lady to take us to our table was a great start... This is where it began to go downhill...we waited 25 minutes to get our drinks. The servers seemed to be very confused where they were up to - 3 tables next to us all received incorrect orders. Also our waitress didn't even remember that she had taken our order which was strange. The food (steamed chicken parcels and chicken taco) were decent but definitely had better. Only decent thing was $5 beer on happy hour. When the waitress came for the bill we had left a â‚¬3 tip on a $20 tab which I believe to be fair for the service we received but the waitress thought otherwise and wouldn't take it. It appeared that she wanted more which definitely shouldn't be the case.
