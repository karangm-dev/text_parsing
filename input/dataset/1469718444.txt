This place has a woman with black dreads working there who is completely intolerant of children. My littlest was checking out the merchandise to keep busy and wasn't doing any harm. No spillage or anything. Our regular place where we go to get my husband's hair cut knows when my son messes up the shelf I put everything back nice and neat before we leave. It keeps him busy and prevents screaming and tantrums out of boredom waiting for his dad to finish with the stylist. We've even bought product from his little discoveries of shampoo and gel. Went to this place for the first time because we were all tired and in a hurry to get my husband's hair cut. Never again. Got treated with hostility by a very annoyed black woman who acted in a huff as she rearranged the shelf. Normally I'd put everything back for the salon but if she's going to act that way to paying customers and curious toddlers then by all means be rude to us and you can do the work yourself and we won't return. If she's the manager or owner it's no wonder the place was dead and lacked customers at one of the busiest times of the day for salons.
