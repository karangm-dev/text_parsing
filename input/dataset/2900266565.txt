If you are looking for the best for your pet then look no further. Today was Mia's first appointment with Dr. Gross and she was outstanding! Mia was very anxious and Dr. Gross was very patient with her. Even though she is a puppy, Dr. Gross took her time to give her a proper check up. She address our concerns with getting her nails trimmed as she has a hard time with people letting her touch her paws and in no time at all Mia's nails were perfectly trimmed. Lastly, the veterinarian took the time to address all our questions. We will be coming back with all of our dog's needs!
