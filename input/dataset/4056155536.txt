The theatre itself is good. Modern, clean, good size, and the seats are comfy. It has a good VIP setup. Decent food options in the building itself. But that's about it as far as good things go. The parking lot is a complete disaster on busy nights; plan to arrive 30 mins before showtime for a decent chance of getting parking in time. And I don't know what it is about this place but there's an abnormally high number of keeners that come here. For the big hits, it's the only theatre I've seen where when trying to pick up advance tickets 2+ weeks in advance and you'll find that all the half-decent seats are already taken. I'll avoid this place as much as I can unless I absolutely must have IMAX or VIP.
