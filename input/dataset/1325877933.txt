I don't really like the staff here. They aren't that nice , and some are just not good communicators. The food is okay and is overpriced for the quality. They almost refused to serve me a medium sized cold brew, telling me its too strong to serve a medium, until I reassured them I drink iced toddy regularly. Parking sucks too. I'm just kind of let down by the place.
