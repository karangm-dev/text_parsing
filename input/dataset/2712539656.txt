WARNING: MY PHONE WAS STOLEN HERE ON SATURDAY NIGHT AROUND MIDNIGHTI've been a regular at the Roxbury for the past year. Yes, this is a super crowded and busy bar, I'm completely aware of this so I'm not blaming the bar. Please just be aware that there are people who will take things from your purse when you aren't looking/ordering a drink at the bar. I'm super disappointed with this kind of behavior/crime in Charlotte so make sure it doesn't happen to you. I did file a police report on Sunday morning - but please be on the lookout for creeps/sketchy behavior.
