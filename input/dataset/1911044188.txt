This location is consistently out of breakfast sandwiches at 8:30am and they always blame the night manager for not taking enough out of freezer. Well someone needs to do their job. Because this is a daily situation were I get stuck in the drive thru to be told that they do not have no breakfast sandwiches. Thanks again for starting my day off wrong Starbucks!!!!!!!
