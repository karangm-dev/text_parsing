ALICE WAS AMAZING!!!  I came in with my sister and mother in law shopping for my wedding dress.  I found one that fit perfectly and I felt so beautiful in it!! I couldn't stop smiling!  Alice made the experience so fun and really personalized my visit.  I was so comfortable with her!  I had left to go check out one other dress at another boutique but found myself in LOVE with the dress that at Brilliant Bridal. I came back and tried the dress on with Alice and I cried with happiness.  it was the dress for me!!! I SAID YES TO THE DRESS at Brilliant Bridal. thank you so much Alice for all your help that day! I can't wait for the big day next year March wearing my beautiful dress!
