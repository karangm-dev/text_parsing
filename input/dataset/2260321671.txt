This company is run by Todd Callewaert and he's a thief. I was out of town for work when the water line broke at my current storage location. Todd had moved me before and we knew some people in common so I called and asked him to go move my items to another storage facility. I e-transferred the $600 fee for 3 months at the new facility and his moving fee. He stole the $600 and my 2 55" smart TVs!!! Thank God the storage facility called me before putting a lien on my unit.Yeah he shut down this company but if you see anything with his name associated RUN. Such a thief and scammer!
