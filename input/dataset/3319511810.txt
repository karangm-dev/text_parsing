I brought my son here on Saturday & from the looks of pictures the burgers are larger than most so we chose to split it, my son is 13 & we could had each eaten our own, our waiter (Daniel) was irritated we only got water with lemon, we ordered the Mac & cheese burger & the fries were the best part full of flavor, the burger, my son could had made that with more flavor! I was disappointed because Guy has such a flare for flavor on his TV show & his restaurant didn't stand to my expectations nor fit the price, & especially the wait time.  We ordered at 2:14 & didn't get the food till 2:53... Once finished eating waiter (Daniel) swung by to see if we would like dessert & I kindly said no thank you. He put the check down hard as our table moved & silverware clanked & walked off to socialize with another table. Glad I had cash! I gave him a few dollars for a tip although it wasn't deserved!
