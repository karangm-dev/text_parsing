Absolutely great!! A local friend recommended them to me after he had used them to move last year.  This company is the real deal. On time, organized, fast and meticulous with the care of protecting everything they move.  The booking process was fast and easy with friendly, pleasant and thorough information. Ann is fantastic and helpful! Everything was spot on with what was explained to me. The movers we're professional, careful and sharp, especially on such a hot day! Our whole move was completely stress free, affordable and quick thanks to Christopher Moving! They are the best moving company I have ever used period.
