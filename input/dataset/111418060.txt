Absolutely terrible. Dr. Zak is very unprofessional and hateful. There is a difference between 'not sugar coating things' and being completely inappropriate. I went to her through my entire pregnancy and aftercare but I have had ENOUGH. She is terrible and has zero bedside manner and refuses to answer questions or help. You always wait at least an hour to see her because she's "running late". If I could give zero stars I would. I will never return to that office again and I hope no other woman has to go through it either. Do not go here if you are pregnant.
