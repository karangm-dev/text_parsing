By far...the venetian has the best rooms on the strip...try the 700 sq ft suite...pretty affordable for the size and quality.  My only complaint is that this hotel is home to TAO...the worst club on EARTH....they sexually discriminate against guys...good luck trying to get in if you're a group of guys.
