To respond to the owner's comment:Big box store? discounts? I'm not in the business of buying?I hope you know how absurd you sound.Allow me to be your guide to the wonderful land of the internet. If I can google "9mm ammo PCM" (the ammo i bought from you) and the first result shows me 1000 rounds for $225.00 - that $0.22 PER ROUND; That's 10 seconds worth of research, I wasn't even trying. Are you telling me I can get a better deal online than what you buy ammo for, as an FFL holder? I beg to differ. Good day, Sir.
