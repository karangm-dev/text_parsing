Took my food to go.   Interior feels like a fast food place and small.   Price I think was a little too much especially comparing to Ohjah just less than 5 minutes away that is a sit down,  tepenyaki style,  cooked in front of you restaurant.   My kids an i enjoy Ohjah but there are times I'd rather have it to go. Taste:  eh,  ok, but not for the price.
