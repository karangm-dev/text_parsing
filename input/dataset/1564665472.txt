Stayed at ritz, ate at Turn for dinner.   It was a Saturday so there was a DJ, music was loud but we enjoyed it.  Server was super, bread and oil was really great, ice tea was fresh, corned beef sandwich was really great.  Overall nice, and now the not nice.   Fried cheese rolled in pretzel crust was good,  shrimp scampi was a sad bowl of melted butter and super thin sticky pasta with 5 shrimp and what looked like pickled red onions.  The shrimp was incredible the rest wasn't edible.  The seat seemed broken, uncomfortable because the cushion sunk so far down the wood frame dug into my legs.   We returned later in the evening for a nightcap and sat at the bar.   I am under 5' so I was barely able to get in the seat at the bar.  2 of the worst drinks we have ever been served.  The turn and passion cosmo, murky dirty pinkish dishwatery looking liquid.  One in a rocks glass with a ice ball and the other in a martini glass. A $33 dollar disappointment.  They also did last call at 1:15am?    Not really worth the money,  if your staying at the Ritz-Carlton byob.
