My first ever in-n-out burger here was amazing! The line was backed up around the store but it moved very fast. As I approached the cashier to put in my order, he made great suggestions as what to order (love the staff here, very friendly and helpful). I ordered the animal style fries, double cheese burger, and a chocolate milk shake. Their portions are huge and I got all that for less than $10! What a deal! I love in-n-out and I can't wait to go back to the mainland to get me some more!! :)
