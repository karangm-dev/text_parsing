We had the absolute best experience buying a car from Shad at All Auto's Direct! The process was incredibly easy and Shad and the team took care of everything with no hassle They are honest and fair which is truly refreshing and so hard to find in car dealers. Two years ago we bought our last car, a Mustang, in Tempe (hint at a place where they predominantly sell Swedish cars) - We loved the car but hated the experience. We traded that car and bought a Ford Expedition at All Auto's Direct and really had a fantastic experience. We so appreciated the transparent, non-pushy approach from the three guys we dealt with during the process, but where they really stood out was the service we received afterwards. The car actually had a few issues, but they immediately assumed responsibility and went above and beyond to resolve them.I don't normally leave comments on service experiences, but I have been extremely impressed by their level of integrity and commitment and will not only recommend them for their practices, but also give them first dibs next time we need to upgrade one of our cars.
