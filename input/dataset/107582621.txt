Francisco was wonderful. Not only was he earlier than USAA had indicated he would be, but he seemed to understand how stressed and sad I was about my much-loved little car's stuck clutch. He even helped me line up a much better repair option than the one I originally had in mind -- and put me on the phone with the mechanic so I could talk about what to expect. Looks like I'll be getting my car back as early as tomorrow (several days quicker than I would have otherwise), as a result.
