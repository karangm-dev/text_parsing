I had a terrible experience with A to Z Mobile and would highly suggest NOT using their service. Once I bought my detail from Livingsocial, it was very, very hard to schedule the detail and once I was  able to finally schedule a time it was months out. On the day that they were scheduled to come out and finally do the detail they could not find my house (which is not at all difficult to find) and proceeded to be rude and unprofessional on the phone because they could not find it. She then yell and scream at me and tell me that they are not coming to do the detail and hung up on me. They never did show up and continued to send me rude texts. STAY AWAY!
