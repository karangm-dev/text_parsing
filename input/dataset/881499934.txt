Got my beautiful little princess here.  I took my time and visited a couple times a week to watch the temperaments of the dogs under consideration.  A couple on my short list got adopted out in the meantime, good for them!  One became ill and was later put down.  The volunteers have handled all the dogs and can fill you in on the personality and popularity of each.  Mine was near the corner stall, so easily overlooked.  For a $20 Christmas special (plus another $30 fees/microchip) she was the best gift of all last year.  Healthy (gained 20# from initial emaciated state), happy, calm, loves to play, ride in the car, hike, a great companion.  Already grown up so no bladder or teething issues.  Was concerned about the pit bull breed, found her to be quite similar to my lab, with a touch more snuggly, more calm and not barky.  The sleek coat is easier on my clothing as well.  Would love to adopt more if I could!
