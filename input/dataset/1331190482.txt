Also known as Avalon Cleaners, I decided to try them out. Unlike other cleaners, you have to pre-pay and they will charge 50 cents for using your credit or debit card. They have same day pickup if dropped off by 9am, otherwise its next day. Sure enough, my clothes were ready next day however I still noticed a shoe scuff mark on one of my pairs of pants, and a pen mark on another. It was pretty obvious. The girl said they can re-clean them with chemicals but could discolor the pants. I chose to accept them as-is and take my business elsewhere next time. Although they are good with same day or next day service, I don't recommend them if you have stains on your clothing so beware, and taking your chances.
