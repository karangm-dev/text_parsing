Afternoon coffee - staff went to the refrigerator, pulled out some pre-made coffee from the morning, reheated it using the frothing wand, and presented it as hot coffee to go.She actually did this.She actually did this.She actually did this.Turns out it is not her idea but that of the owner.  This speaks volumes about what sort of coffee shop this is.On top of that, there is virtually no seating here.  Only one employee working, so things move slowly.  And they didn't have Kona coffee to drink on my visit, as it is only served occasionally - at Kona 13.
