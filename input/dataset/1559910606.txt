I've had a gift card for the last 4 years but have not been able to utilize it as there are no Dunkin Donuts out in Orange County. So while we were out in AZ I was ecstatic to finally see one. I went last night 5 min to closing just to check if the gift card was still valid and the guy over the counter was not very friendly. I told him my story about being excited to finally use the gift card and he rolled his eyes and said "great you come right as we're about to close I don't have anything" mind you I had no intentions purchasing anything just wanted to check my balance. So today with the same excitement we go to get breakfast and once again the guy at the counter didn't share my enthusiasm of finally using the gift card. I got a large iced cofee but the MacDonald's ice cofee has more flavor. The bagel and cream cheese was your average bagel and cream cheese. Must say the donut was pretty good. But aside from the donuts I'm not really missing much with not having a Dunkin Donuts in Orange County.
