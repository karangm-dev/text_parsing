The food is MEDIOCRE. I usually don't do Yelp reviews, but I feel like I was robbed... I had the Pupusa plate - Salvadorian/Mexican plate. First of all, as I smelled the plate I thought this smells like microwave and old...hmm maybe not too many people order this plate. Second, I thought the menu said potatoes and bread- nope didn't happen. Third, overpriced. Fourth, the food 100% didn't taste fresh - smell, taste, texture, you named it it WASN'T fresh. Fifth, I ended up in the bathroom. Sadly to say, try another place for exquisite food. I hate to do bad reviews on small businesses....However, something has to change read and pay attention to the YELP reviews. I didn't bother complaining because of the other reviews, sounds like the staff/owner do not take too well on reading/hearing criticism or simply from a PAYING customer. Good luck.
