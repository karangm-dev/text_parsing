I think I'm addicted to their homemade pita chips and hummus!  I'm from Detroit, the Mecca of middle eastern food and the chicken shawarma and garlic dip is as close as I can get to the real thing. Greek fries are good too but they have a creamy dressing instead of the traditional oily type but they're good! The sriacha hummus is soooo good! I eat here at least once a week! Go early tho bc the line goes out the door and can be intimidating the first time you're there. Huge falafel too!!
