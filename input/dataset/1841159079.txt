This thai place just opened this year but it is REALLY really tasty. The menu offers your typical items such as padthai and curries, but there is something for everyone here. The fried eggroll with banana and chocolate is very tasty! The service is extremely friendly. I have always left Mint Cafe with a full belly and a smile. For thai, it is a little more expensive than average so expect to spend about 10-15 dollars per dish.
