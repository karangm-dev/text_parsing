I decided we should get a professional to come check our airflow issues on our second floor and tuneup our furnace. We were pretty confused by our duct system and weren't sure about what went where. So glad I called Rudy Cools! Our technician was Charles and he was right on time and very professional. As he performed the tuneup, he discovered our heat pump wasn't working. After some discussion, Charles figured our new thermostat wasn't compatible and recommended we test the original one that came with the house. Thanks to Charles, we discovered that we purchased the wrong thermostat for our system. He also showed us how the airflow worked and explained how to regulate the temperatures for each floor. We really appreciated him educating us on our system. Another plus is that their technicians are not working on commission so there's no pressuring you to about additional repairs or even services that you may be able to do yourself. Rudy Cools cools will definitely be our resource for any HVAC needs in the future.
