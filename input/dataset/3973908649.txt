Absolutely the best Italian meal I've had in a very long time. The antipasto platter was a great share the table first course, the mortadella was melt in your mouth delicious as was the eggplant tapenade. I got the gnocchi with marinara and meatballs, with chianti. Finished with lemon gelato would come again in a heartbeat and probably do the blind tasting!
