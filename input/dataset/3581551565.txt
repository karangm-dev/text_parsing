Gluten free fried chicken. Yes, you read that right. It exists and it's here and it is so glorious I cannot even. Just can't even. Crunchy, greasy, salty perfection with juicy meat. Add a side of grits and all is well with the world. It was so good I was thisclose to tears. It had been many years since my fried chicken palate was satisfied, and once I took that first bite of that beautiful dish I asked the server if she was sure she put the right order in..this can't be gluten free. Heaven help us, it's 12 hours later and I'm not sick. Please note that they do fry it in a separate oil and away from any cross contamination so it will take a little longer to come out. We ordered it as soon as we sat down. Worth the wait. Try the Southern Peach for a sweet cocktail. It pairs well with the decadence of the chicken. Oh, the deviled eggs are creamy and savory and not your mom's stuff she served at the holidays. Service was excellent; the entire staff was happy to talk with us, even the manager came out and asked about my gluten free experience. I cannot wait to come back and inhale an entire order on my own - hubby and I shared it with the grits and eggs and left full and happy.
