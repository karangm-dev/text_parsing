Just pulled up about 20 minutes ago and no one was at the drive-thru, pulled up again because they appeared after we were gone. Took them about 5 minutes to take our order. In addition, she was giving attitude because we said hello due to bad audio coming through. I only gave 1 star because we actually got our food. Very irritated and disappointed.
