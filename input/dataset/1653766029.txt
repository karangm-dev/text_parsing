Excellent food!! I ordered the shrimp tempura & California rolls. My roommate had the sesame chicken with chicken fried rice. I couldn't believe how delicious the sushi was, as it was takeout food. The sesame chicken was also delicious & the chicken fried rice was perfect! Will definitely be ordering from here again!!
