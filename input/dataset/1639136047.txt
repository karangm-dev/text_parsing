This was my first time at Thai Gourmet, and after seeing the 4 star reviews, I was intrigued to try it! I must say, the atmosphere was warm and inviting. That being said the food was off key for me. I am a huge lover of thai food, and quite honestly not that particular with what I get. I have a few go to favs, chicken tom yum soup being at the top of the list. The soup here was overly salty, not overly tangy because I do love that. It tasted like a huge handful of salt was accidentally (or maybe not) added to it and made it difficult to finish it through. Not to mention the chicken tasted rather old and not fresh what so ever which was a HUGE downfall. I did also try the chicken satay, and I will say this was crispy and cooked well, tasted fresh, and had good dipping sauces along side it. I don't know if it was just a bad batch of chicken in the soup or what, but it was not good.For my entree, I got the mala string green beans with shrimp added to it. Both tasted like they had been sitting in the freezer for too long, and not fresh at all and it really ruined the meal for me. And for an extra $4.00 for added shrimp that tasted frozen and not fresh?!? That is absurd. The service was also okay. Our waitress was nice and tended well to us but definately looked like she was ready for us to be out of there so she can get home. I can't blame her cuz it was towards the end of the day, but I do have to say it turned me off a little. Because of this, and the nice atmosphere, I gave it 2 stars. It was the food that made it take more of a hit.
