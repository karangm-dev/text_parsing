The service is terrible. We had a huge group going, but it is summer time on campus, and few peoplewere there. We did our orders in shifts, and I was among the first few. We hada few people arriving late, and their orders were taken maybe 10-20 minutesafter mine. After the whole party--except me--got their dishes AND finished them,mine came, with a simple cold indifferent apology. I did go to the waiter to checkon my dish, and she just said the dish was in line. Be prepared for a long wait with indifferent apology.
