This location is seriously lacking in comparison to others (the Blue Diamond location mainly).  My boyfriend and I went here last night at 8 for dinner and it was dead.  I didn't mind too much at first because I thought we were going to be constantly checked up on because of the lack of parties there, but boy was I wrong.  We got placed in the back on the restaurant and it took the waiter 25 minutes to even realize that we were there and take our drink orders!!! Wth?! Also many other staff members walked right by us not asking if we were okay because I kept looking around for service.  Finally a girl that was cleaning saw us and grabbed the server right anyway. Ugh.  We were waiting for a party so we decided to just order drinks to start.  We sat there for a good while not being checked up on, with no sauces on our table, or even asked if we wanted appetizers while we waited.  I was livid.  When the waiter finally did come back, we decided to just order before he disappeared again.  Also while we were sitting there were at least 6 staff members (the hostess included) just standing around chit-chatting in the empty area.  I noticed that the hostess was annoyed to be called to the front when patrons arrived.When we did get our food, it was tasty as usual.  The service and professionalism was just lacking for a restaurant that was soooo empty.  We waited most of the night for any decent service and this is unacceptable because obviously the waiters/waitresses had nothing to do because they were able to be standing in the back area RIGHT BY US chit-chatting.I must say Dave's, you either need better management at this location or to get rid of the slackers who get mad when they have to do their job (the hostess).
