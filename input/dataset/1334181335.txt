I have been going to the other place by the mall since its opened. I saw Perfect Arch on the way to work and saw the $6 fee. She did a better job than either of the three girls at the other place. I usefully get nicked/cut from the other place. This girl did not cut me up once. She explained the difference in the threads that are used (she uses 100%cotton thread shipped from India and the other places have been using sewing thread.). What a world of difference. My eyebrows look great and the process didn't hurt once. I kept waiting for the my skin to get cut but it never happened AND  she actually had a conversation with me. Not like the other place where there is a movie going on in the background and the workers are talking amongst themselves. Go to Perfect Arch!
