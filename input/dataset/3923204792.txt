I wish I could give a 0 star review. It was my first and last time ever ordering here. I got the tonkatsu ramen and a lemon black tea drink. The ramen soup just tasted like water and the egg was so overcooked. The drink wasn't horrible, but a few minutes after finished I started to get nauseous and threw up. Would not reccomend this place at all.
