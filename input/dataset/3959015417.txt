Ripped off yet again by this store.  Was in a rush, and very few places left that print photos.  Offered $5 for a glossy print, and $10 for a glossy.  Really? 100% more.  The price was already more than what one would expect for a 8x10, but the relative difference was clearly an attempt to extract more.   Reasonable quality print, but no Black's.  Having experienced this store before, I would have stayed away had there been a choice.
