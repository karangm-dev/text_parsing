Wow, this place is trying VERY hard to be bro-party-central: waitresses are chosen for looking good in the revealing uniforms than their skill in the service industry, music is loud bro-jams, and MMA is all over the TVs.Visit 1: I sat at a table with a friend. Even though there were only two occupied tables in the place, our waitress seemed overwhelmed: our order for a second round of drinks never happened and she messed up our check. We had two sandwiches which were greasy but pretty good.Visit 2: I sat at the bar with a few friends. This time service was much better. Beer and wings were on special, so that's what we had. The wings were a little better than standard bar food.On the upside, there are daily specials on food and drinks. It's above average greasy bar fare but it's not like they're promising find cuisine and health food.
