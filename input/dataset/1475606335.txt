This place is fun! Pricey, but fun.  We took some friends from out of town here and they loved it.  Being on the 2nd or 3rd floor tiers are more fun because you have a better view of the range and the likelihood of making it into one of the targets is easier. :) They have clubs for kids, as well.  The food is good and the service is really great.  Friendly staff always ready to help out and be at your service.  I'd definitely go again, but when my pockets are a little more full.
