Not what you would expect for a $150+ meal for two. For an "upscale" steakhouse the food and service were nothing great. First, we never got the bread our server said would be right out when we arrived. We proceeded to ask for it two additional times before it was finally brought to us when we received our entree. The halibut was ok, but over cooked and the sauce on top was over bearing. The calamari was decent, but I have definitely had better. I also wish they put whatever sauce they had on it on the side so they breaded part stayed crispy. The only saving grace of the meal were the Fleming's potatoes. They were delicious. I doubt I would ever find myself back here, but if I did I would get the potatoes. Lastly, its not necessary to ask every time you refill water/ice tea, just fill it up and if I am not thirsty anymore I won't drink it and thus you won't refill it. If you are looking for a delicious meal with great service this is not the place for you. My personal favorite in the valley is Mastro's City Hall - you will not leave disappointed.
