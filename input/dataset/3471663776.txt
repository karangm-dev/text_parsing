I went here as a group of 6 friends and our waiter, Sonia, was great and very quick to understand how we paired up to split our meals/receipts. I tried poutine here for the first time- Poutine BOM, and my friends ordered Poutine Dynamite, which was a bit more spicier with jalape√±os. Both were good! Add a little ketchup on top and it was perfect. The poutine portions were also large enough to split between 2 people.
