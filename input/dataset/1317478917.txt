This is my 2nd time here, and this place is legit. I had a carne asada taco,  chicken enchilada, and al pastor taco... pretty damn good.... meat is marinated great and everything tasted super fresh. The menu is pretty simple but don't let that fool you, the food has some good flavor. The inside is pretty empty , but has a salsa bar area and some tables to eat inside. The staff was super nice and friendly. Check this place out, nice to see a ma and pa taco shop on the west side of town.
