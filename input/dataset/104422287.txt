This is my second visit to Tom's urban. I really enjoy this place for breakfast/lunch. Great food and selection, outdoor heated/misted seating. The grits are to die for, prices are just right and...Bottomless Mimosas.  Also great selection for vegetarians. I hit in my book and I will return next time I am in Vegas.
