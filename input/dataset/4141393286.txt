Update - was contacted directly by the owner after my previous review, who was very apologetic and sincere and offered to refund me for the bad experience and to buy me lunch if I would come back in.  Can't say enough about the customer service now.  He was very upset about my experience and the last employee's reaction to my phone call.  No wonder he is successful!
