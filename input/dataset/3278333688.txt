This place is keeping itself in business by promoting weekly and monthly recurring customers.  They play a video about diseases related to back troubles of which 75% would be thrown away by the American Medical Association. Some chiros will help you. They will not. I was told that one visit does nothing and repeat trips are the only way to get relief.  Nice receptionist, but morally bankrupt premise that their business is built on. Not practice. Business.
