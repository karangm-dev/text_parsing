Went in to look at ladies Uggs. Good selection. Dark brown, light brown, grey, some with buttons on the side. There were lots of comfy looking slippers by Ugg also.TIP - You can save $50 if you can fit into a kids' size - kids' size 6 being the largest.The gal working was amazing - helpful, not pushy, happy to go and check for sizes in the back.She even schooled me on Uggs - that yes they are Australian as we all know but that they were created for surfers that were coming in from the ocean to keep their feet warm! They are not even a winter boot technically meant for snow and ice!Who knew!? Won't stop me from buying several more pairs, I love them for wintertime. They slip on and off never allowing your feet to get too hot, but always toasty warm when needed outside! One of the best inventions ever!Of course this store has many other brands of shoes, boots, whatever you need.The store was clean and I will be back to purchase! Would like to see some promos happening in store for X-mas!
