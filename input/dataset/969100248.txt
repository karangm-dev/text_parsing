First things first, the staff is amazing. Very cheerful and willing to assist. The interior design really sets the mood and whoever has the aux has great taste. My first time in, I tried a coconut diamond bar dipped halfway with dark chocolate and topped with almonds and coconut, it was delightful. Chopped it up with one of the workers as I ate my ice cream, closing time was approaching but the staff was in no rush to boot my friend and I out, unlike other places. I will most definitely be back.
