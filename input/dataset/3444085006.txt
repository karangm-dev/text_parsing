Just went there today to go bowling with a few friends and it was a pretty great experience. Very friendly staff, even though they made us dispose of outside drinks that we had brought in. Although very understable, in fact after walking over to the bar to get a coke I was told that it was on the house anyways.Not to mention that the bowling games were only a dollar durin the time that I was there, so only $30 for about 3 hours of fun. Have to say it won't be my last time visiting there and might even try out some of their pool tables as well as their food next time.
