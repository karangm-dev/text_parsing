Never in my life have I been to a Fatburger- in fact I've never heard of it. Strolled by and saw they have awesome cheap breakfast and even better... strong breakfast drinks! Our server was awesome (beautiful black gal) and the people watching is stellar! Drinks were $10 but strong and food was great. Had a $4 breakfast sandwich and we were set after a few screwdrivers. Patio had nice heaters as well. I dig it!
