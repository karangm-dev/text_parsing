This place is ridiculous. Many Starbucks provide free water even if you don't buy anything, but this one doesn't. This Starbucks charges 50 cents for water. I mean seriously? My father asked me to buy my mother an espresso after enjoying a nice stroll around the hotel and the bars. I was going to get a water along with the espresso and the cashier informed me that I would be charged for the water. Really? What kind of service is that. My dad was even going to decline on the espresso, but since my mom was having a hard time staying up we got the coffee. Really, 50 cents for water?
