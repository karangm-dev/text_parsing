This place has the worst communication!! My couch was supposed to be delivered & I waited all day & night for them to forget & they called the delivery guy at his home to go back the store & get it then deliver it to me at 10 o'clock at night, then 2 weeks later I get a table & the day it was supposed to be delivered they accidentally ordered the wrong table so I had to wait the next day they should it would be delivered and set up at noon 5 hours pass by & no word from the store!!! I then call for them to have the worst customer service!! & they don't know where their delivery guy is!!! I'll never order anything else from them worst customer service & delivery is horrible!!!
