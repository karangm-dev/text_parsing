I bought a 60-minute massage session from Groupon. I walked in 5 minuets before my 10 am appointment. The massage therapist gave me some paperwork to complete. By the time I finished forms and got undressed, it was already 10:15 am. She gave me only 35 mins of massage and finished her service at 10:50 am. When I asked her if my appointment was for an hour of massage, she said shamelessly that she always finish 10 mins early, so that she could be on time for her next customer. I understand if she finishes at 11 am, even if I got only 45 mins of massage because of paperwork to fill out.  But there was absolutely NO reason to cut me short at the end!!! I will never go back there again
