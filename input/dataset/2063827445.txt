Went here to order some late night breakfast. Can't f____g believe they charge extra to sub out cottage cheese for hash browns. I've traveled all over the country, and this is the first place I have had that does this.When you travel a lot, it's the little things that matter. I travel a lot, and while I can afford it, it's the spirit of the charge that befuddles me.
