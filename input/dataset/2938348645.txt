Sometimes its the smallest details that make the biggest impact.When we arrived, we were greeted by Jana, the sales rep who I spoke to on the phone, and who said would be waiting for us; and she was.She handed me the keys to the car, and said "go start it up and check it out/ Ill be out with a tag"Very nice.  No pressure. What's even better is we were able to do the test drive by ourselves! A Huge plus when it comes to customer service, if you ask me.Of course I already knew I wanted the car...so she started some paperwork, got a # for my trade in..and I was signing paperwork in a little over 30 mins.Chris in finance was super nice, had a great attitude, was well organized, and got me my lowest rate to date on a car loan( and I have owned a LOT of cars).The customer waiting area is nice and clean, with plenty of drinks and snacks to hold over any appetite.It doesn't get any better than this!
