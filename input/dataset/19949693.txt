I've been a big fan of their body butters, skincare line, and home products for a while now. What lured me here in the first place was their home fragrance oils that they were burning in the store. The Exotic blend, their signature home fragrance.  Anytime that I have ever entered the store everyone has always been friendly and helpful and is able to suggest products for my sensitive skin.  It pays to become a member of their rewards program, I have made out like a bandit on a lot of purchases.  The sales staff here at this store is wonderful!  One of the sales clerk left a message on my phone couple months ago reminding me that I still had $15 off my purchase.  Forward 2 months later..I just popped in the store since they have a Buy 2 get 1 free offer deal going on. I didn't have any coupon or the message, but sales clerk took my word and rung up adding my $15 off discount.  She was able to look up my info after the fact and yes it was noted that they did call me.  Good organizational skills on their part! So not only did I get the sale prices, I got $15 off my purchase PLUS another 10% off of my total sale with my reward card! Spent less than $5 on 3 items that totaled $30.  Its no wonder why this is one of my favorite stores.
