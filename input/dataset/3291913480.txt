This is the worst restaurant I have ever been to The food had set out in that refrigerator part where the desserts are for quite some time because the food was refrigerator burnt. When they brought the food it was ice cold when I asked the waitress if she could warm it up the manager came over and was so rude.. the manager was so rude. We had a party of three my sister never received her food and they drop the food in the back and it looks like they picked it up off the floor and shopped it on my friends dish.we walked out I will never ever go back to that place again Worst customer service worst manager worst food very very disappointed Department of health services should be involved with the preparation of the food
