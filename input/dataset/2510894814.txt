Had my haircut on NOV 2.  Online check-in was great, the haircut and stylist, so-so. I don't remember her name but she was the Asian girl with long hair.   I know you get what you pay for  but there should also be some professionalism.   While she was clipping my hair shorter than I wanted. Just trim all over please and a #4 on the sides.  It came out much shorter.  So while she has the clipper buzzing in my ear she stops and starts talking with her co worker who I guess came back from lunch.   They start discussing HER haircut and im just sitting there???? HELLO!!      The other coworker had  short reddish hair and she was a  little tall.  She kept walking by and checking herself in the mirror. Really?Well the un professionalism continues at the checkout while paying for my haircut.  As the Asian girl is ringing me up, she stops mid transaction and turns around to chat with her red head friend again about social media postings or something like that.   Wow...I won't be returning.
