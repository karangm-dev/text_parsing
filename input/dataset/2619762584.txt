Wasnt going to write a review until the manager called my girlfriend a liar on yelp about her review. The wings were in fact undercooked and i found a different place that cooks them perfect. I gave this place 2 chances and unfortunately they were undercooked both times. Maybe the cook can visually inspect them instead relying just on the thermometer. Also the manager likes to reply to the negative reviews and try and persuade you that you are wrong about your opinion. The truth is your wings are undercooked and although some people dont mind it, i and some others hate it. The way you come at customers leaving honest reviews is disrespectful and is another reason i will not return.
