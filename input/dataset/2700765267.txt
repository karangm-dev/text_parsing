Parry's is amazing! From the decor to the food and definitely the customer service! The manager, Johnny is awesome! Knows me by face and name. And some of the employees do too. I'm always greeted with a welcome back. And They always make sure I'm good throughout my visit. Today, Brandon was AH-MAZINGGGG! Made sure we knew we could sample beers, recommended what we should get and what the best bang for our buck would be (even though everything has already great pricing)! Thanks Brandon, Thanks Johnny Thanks Charity & staff for always making my experience exceptional!
