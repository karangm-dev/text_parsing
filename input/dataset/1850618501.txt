Three times in the past month I have gone to this location and the Coca Cola Super Soda Machine is out of LARGE CUPS and today they were out of both LARGE CUPS & ALL DIET SODA. With 3 people working the counter I would expect this not to happen. One of the ladies did offer to change it out real quick but I didn't have the time to wait so I still want to give them more than 1 STAR. I still love getting my car washed here and they always do a STELLAR JOB but the girls need to get their act together working inside. Update!  Alexis is the bomb!!!!  Not only did she recognize me She let me know today that my favorite drink was in, (zero grape mellow yellow). I'm sure they are headed the right way with leaving someone in charge who cares about their customers. Go Alexis!!! Bump!
