We waited over an hour for our three cheeseburgers even though the restaurant was nearly empty.  When the food arrived the burgers were cold and my kids didn't even have cheese on their burgers . They took them away and took ten minutes to add and melt the cheese.  The burgers were inedible at that point.  They chose to "comp" our sodas as an apology.  Wow.  Thanks for a shit meal and zero apologies for crap service.  Wont go back even if it's a free meal.
