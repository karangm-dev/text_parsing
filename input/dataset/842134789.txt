They have been making harassing phone calls to my cell phone for years.  Every time i block the number i get a call from another number.  They are illegally sourcing leads and change the name of the company to safelite auto glass when confronted.  Emily, a 'manager' said i was i liar, that they had never called me before, and had no idea how they got my personal cell phone number.  they deserve to go out of business.
