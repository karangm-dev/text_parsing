My fianc√© and I had reservations for Saturday night at 10pm, May 5th which was also Cinco de Mayo. We knew because of that they would be extremely busy hence why we made reservations. We also booked a later time so the crowd/rush would hopefully die down a bit. Wrong! We got there at 9:45pm, 15 mins early and weren't even greeted until 20 mins later. We were then brought to the corner of the restaurants were we were seated and given menus. Half an hour of waiting and waiting with no one to come even say hello or bring us a glass of water we decided to go call the waitress who said she'd be right over... wrong again. People all night were complaining about slow service. There was a birthday party there who waited an hour and a half just for their drinks!!! When asked how many people were staffed, they told us 4 in the kitchen, 4 servers, and two bar tenders. Ummm hello, it's Cinco de Mayo and you had over 200 reservations for that night, shouldn't you have staffed it more appropriately? After waiting an hour with no service at all, we decide to get up and leave. Unfortunately, I never got to taste the food but due to the service, or lack of, I won't ever be returning...
