Loved that I was able to get in quickly and that my nail tech was super friendly, nice and professional. However, after paying $100 for a no-chip mani and regular pedi, I would have expected my nails to be flawless. Perhaps it was the polish but there was bubbling and unfinished edges and the polish around my cuticles is already chipping. I will wait until I get back to Chicago next time and see my local tech. So disappointed and hoped to have been able to save and go at least 3 weeks in between appointments. Seems I will likely have to go back sooner than usual.
