My hair was colored here last week and it came out NOTHING like how I wanted. The teacher amber was rude about me not liking it and we scheduled another appointment to have it fixed. When I got here however it turns out that the receptionist failed to actually book my appointment and the teacher failed to fill out the necessary paperwork for me to return. Now I have to see my family for the holidays all while hiding my hideous hair. Horrible school. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
