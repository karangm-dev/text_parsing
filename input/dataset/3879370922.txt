The service & food here was amazing! My mother, sister & I went here after my sister auditioned for my high school. Our server, Emily, was very enthusiastic, kind, and funny. She didn't ask for us to post a review to help her go to Disney, California, but her service was too great to not do so!! Overall, I recommend this place if you're debating over your daily breakfast/brunch meals!
