Ok, this place had us right from the start. My wife just finished  running a marathon and was extremely cold. Seeing her shiver, our waiter brought her a cup of homemade chicken vegetable soup on the house. Who does that these days?The service really was great. From start to finish. The food was excellent. It was standard fare for a grill but you can tell those that prepared it really cared. I had the LA wrap and my wife had more soup. Both were really good. They make fresh, homemade soup every day. I'll be back. You should give them a try too.
