I hate trying to find a new salon in a new town. There are about a JILLION, and one bad haircut takes a while to overcome. This was compounded by the fact that I absolutely adored my stylist in my previous hometown of Atlanta. My first haircut in Las Vegas was not so hot. I actually had to go back and get it cut again because it was several different lengths. So, my 5 stars are a vote for my new Las Vegas stylist, Jenna at Hypnotic. The salon itself is a nice salon, but I am not really a snoot when it comes to salon architecture, but they play music that makes me want to dance... important. As for Jenna, she is from Las Vegas, and she makes me laugh. I think a radio station should give her a spot about Vegas from the eyes of a true Las Vegan because she has this great delivery and . . . oh, the hair cut is probably what you want to know about. I love it every time. She definitely takes the time to listen to what you want, and she makes it happen. I think the price is moderate for this type of salon; it isn't Great Clips dollars, but it isn't book months in advance West Village either.
