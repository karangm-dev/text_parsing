***ATTENTION LOCALS!!!***This place was Incredible! Came in on date night with my Husband to try something different than classic dinner & a movie. It was such a great idea! Low Down: Its a bit away from China Town in It's own shopping center. The outside looks a little plain and so does the decor inside. They were  quite but extremely polite.  Yes there's a bit of a language barrier. However, they were Wonderful! The rooms were dark so we didn't really get to see. Most likely because we went after dinner (please see my review about dinner @ Yojie's!!) We did the 40min manager special, full body massage. It was so relaxing and I cannot emphasize enough what a great job they did. We both had trouble staying awake. The professionalism while paying was an awesome change up from everywhere in the city where tips are "expected." We tipped well because they most certainly deserved it. Overall: HIGHLY recommend! Don't miss out because of location. This is a place to drive to! We drove 30min & the drive as well as every dollar was very well spent.
