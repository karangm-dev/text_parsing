BG is the best stylist! I love my new hairdo. With summer around the corner, I wanted to cut my hair short... as in real short. I walked right in on a Saturday afternoon and was scheduled for an appt. later that evening. The lady at the front desk told me she would call if an opening came up. Sure enough, within the next 30 mins I received a call and was now ready to try a hairstyle that was new and sassy without being loud.  I wanted a pixie, but wasn't really sure and BG helped me by patiently  walking me through the various choices. We finally decided on one. Not once, during my time there did I feel like I needed to read a magazine. BG made me feel extremely comfortable and surprisingly enough I felt like I could trust her with my hair (remember, this was my 1st time ever here). BG hurt the inside of her palm a few days back and was extremely cautious with how she handled my hair (she even changed her band-aid, just so I felt clean and comfortable). I strongly suggest going here for the following reasons:- Their staff is extremely friendly, yet professional.- Trust me, their team KNOWS what they are doing.- They are economically priced.Kudos BG and the team, I will be coming back. Thank you guys, the compliments just won't stop! :D
