We've been taking our Shih Tzu to Tails A Waggin for over two years.  We had tried a couple of other groomers in Henderson before and just weren't very satisfied.  At one place I came back to pick up our pooch and he was in a cage on a shelf barking like crazy, probably because he doesn't like heights.  Both places just didn't seem to really care about the job they had done or about our pet.  We have nothing but good to say about how our pet is treated and groomed at Tails A Waggin.  They do have a few small dogs who are loose in the shop but our Shih Tzu loves that.  Usually, our pet is put into a separate small cage on the floor that still allows a little interaction between the other dogs.  We've never seen any issues between dogs in the many times we have gone to Tails A Waggin.Jim or Cindy always confirm how we want our dog groomed when we drop him off.  It usually takes just a couple of hours before we get a phone call that they are finished grooming him.  Our dog loves going there and he looks so cute with the colorful handkerchief they put on him afterwards.
