Very poor . Buyer aware. They took a 1000 deposit from my wife for a car. In front of me they told me it was refundable. Now they will not return money. We are fighting it but want to let you know this is a scam company. They lie and say anything to get a deal. Update: the credit card company agreed and refunded her money back. Though they did fight it. Buyer beware on this group of thieves. We have also been waiting to replace out airbag for a long time...they just dont care...amazes me about the very poor service
