Yelpers....thank you! I was jonesing for a good fish Sandwich or Shrimp Po Boy and after seeing the amazing reviews I had drive over. Pros: cajun shrimp po boy! It's a large sandwich, the sauce took it to the po' boy level. Location is clean, doesn't have that stuffy Fried foods smell & smog and they offer a large selection of fresh fish. Cons: I just killed my po boy sandwich and enjoyed my visit - not a con in sight!
