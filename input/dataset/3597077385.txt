We had breakfast here, and the pancake was pretty darn good. However, our flatiron steak and eggs featured and 8" by 1" by 1" piece of steak. We made the most of it, and then the guy next us got his and it was 3 times bigger! We mentioned this to our not-very available waiter, and he said he thought they were all the same weight, but there was nothing he could do. I would also have loved salt and pepper, or even some Tabasco for the eggs, but there was none on any table, and the staff were stretched too thin to get anyone's attention.
