This place fucking sucks, it's so god damn hot and it's suppose to be winter, i could feel myself sweat in this place. They should fix the A/C immediately. Second off the employees suck at giving wait times, they said 25-30 mins and it took over a hour. On top of everything else the staff was horrible
