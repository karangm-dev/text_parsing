This place sucks!!!!! It smells sour, the place is so family oriented, if you are remotely enthusiastic they yell at you #dontcallyourselvesasportsbarthen speaking of, a rude  Indian (middle eastern) woman grabbed my arm after her husband classlessly addressed my husband about him being loud at the bar during playoff baseball and the server said MY HUSBAND was being disruptive, um...how about the trash that grabbed my arm????????? That's disruptive not to mention a bad example for her son, but whatever you can't teach class TO TRASH!!!!!!! NEVER going back. I'll spend all my money next door at the best place ever.... ISABELS!!!! FU Blue 32!!!!!
