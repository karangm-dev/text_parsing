This is scream a whole in a wall full of goodness. I am so happy that I had the opportunity to dine here. The staff is sooooo kind. They remember me from my last visit with my sister. This was my first time eating Vietnamese food and it wont be my last. I ordered the pho which was super tasty with beef. and I also order the curry chicken which was amazing it was sweet curry also with vitemanse coffee that they bring to you in a nice pour over with condensed milk making the iced coffee
