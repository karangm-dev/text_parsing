We used Creative Bridal for our Vegas wedding at MGM Grand as part of our wedding package. Originally it was only to get my husband tuxedo for the wedding. Unfortunately, my wedding dress from David's had an alteration issue and the back of my dress ripped when I was finally trying it on for the last time the day before the wedding. Since we were on our way to get a tux fitting for my husband he thought it would be best to ask them if they can help us fix it because I was in tears since the dress was ripped so bad that my butt was hanging out. Britney picked us up at MGM and brought us and during conversation she did say let's look at the dress and see what can be done. Kelly and Brittany did just that, they quickly placed me in my dress while Taisha took my husband in to get his tux fitted. All while making sure he didn't see me. I'm so grateful for all three ladies! I highly recommend them! (Sorry if I got anyone names wrong)
