Shopping at Ulta in Gastonia yesterday and noticed the Esthetician at the brow bar waxing a client with NO GLOVES on while waxing. The whole time I was there I watched as she finished with one clients and moved on to another, with only hand sanitizer as a method of sanitation, again no gloves with second client. Maybe gloves don't fit the Benefit image, but cross-contamination and possibly infecting clients with bacteria is not ok in my book.
