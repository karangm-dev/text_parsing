I've never had better tasting dumplings. This place is super authentic. You come here for the food only period. It's a small old fashion place. My dad who traveled all over China says this place tasted way better than restaurants in LA and SF and was shocked to find a gem in Arizona.I would recommend the beef pan fried buns, pork dumplings and soy milk (homemade).
