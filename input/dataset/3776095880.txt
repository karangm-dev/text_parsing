I love this place!!  I have been here a little over a year. I renewed my lease without hesitation. The office staff have always been helpful and courteous, especially Sheldon. The grounds are kept clean and the couple of times I needed maintenance someone came almost immediately.  I always feel safe here. This place does deserve five stars in my opinion.
