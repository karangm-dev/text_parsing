Yes... the Boba Tea explosion is in full force. I have been to Lee Lee International Supermarket in Chandler many times, but I never noticed this little gem next to it until a couple years ago. Boba Tea House has serving up some of the best boba tea in the Valley long before it became a big thing. They have a fantastic array of flavors and drink choices to choose like fruit slushes, snow, milk tea, pudding, mango jelly, coffee jelly, etc. They even have snacks like popcorn chicken, fried tofu, and fries. The staff is super friendly and the prices are reasonable. I still laugh at my friends who have no idea what Boba Tea is or are too afraid to suck up one of those chewy ball things. LOL. In case you didn't know, Boba Tea is a flavored tea (usually with milk) to which chewy tapioca balls or fruit jellies are added. I think they are super delicious. Today I got the Blueberry Milk Boba Tea and it made for the perfect snack in the middle of my day. Another favorite of my mine is the honeydew milk tea.
