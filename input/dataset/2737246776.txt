For a place that says "open until midnight" i expected that the store would actually have a full line of products and someone to greet you upon arrival.... this was at 10:30pm. Ummmm, that was not the case during my visit. No one was there to even say, "hello," and when looking at the flavors available there were only two to choose from (chocolate and cucumber something). One of my biggest pet peeves is an "open" store that's not really open... might as well be closed right?!I went to this location with my wife with hopes to have my sweet tooth satisfied, but was disappointed due to this experience. I would give it one star, but that's just not fair because I didn't even try their goodies. Hopefully next time I'll have a better experience and arrive 5 hours before the stated closing time so I can actually see what their 4 star review is all about.
