My girlfriend and I made the trek from South Charlotte.  Wow, was it worth it, worth the wait, Holy Cow!  We couldn't decide what to get, so we both got two.  The life changer is just that.  I lived in Chicago as a teenager, and USED to think a Chicago dog was the best there is...no longer.  Chili man's life changer is the best hot dog I've ever had.  Can't wait to go again.  I think he's right, my husband may have a problem with this, but I may be waking up in the night saying, "Chili man, that's a life changer"
