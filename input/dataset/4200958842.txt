Was here for the grand opening and it was way worth the wait! No more driving down to avondale this is a perfect location. On the inside everything is even better. Got to see the new movie The Accountant in the Cine 1 XL which has the widest screen not only in the valley but in the whole western region! 83' ft wide to be exact. Plus the dolby atmos sound theres nothing else like it. For being the opening day everything went smoothly! I think this place was more than we could all expect but much needed for the area. Can't wait to come back again!
