ALERT!!!!!  Absolutely DO NOT USE Dependable Auto Shippers!!!!!  THEY ARE CARJACKERS and THIEVES!  My husband contracted with them back at the end of August to ship our car from CA to VA.  To make a long, horrifying story short, to date, we still have not received our car and are essentially having to secure a lawyer, file police report, and figure out what other recompense there is for consumers. Just as other reviews share, they are very difficult to reach and we have had no luck for the last 8 weeks with reaching anyone there or having anyone there reach out to us about the status of our car.  At this point, we are concerned that they never intended to deliver the car (carjacking and theft) and that we will never see the care again.  This has been a complete nightmare!  Stay away from Dependable Auto Shippers and any third party that works with them!  Be forewarned!!!!
