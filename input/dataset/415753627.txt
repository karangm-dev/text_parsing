I kind of love meat turnovers of any kind, samosas, dumplings and empanadas, so when I came by here to try out the beef and chicken empanadas, I wasn't disappointed. Service is really friendly and because it's right in the heart of the gay village , the people watching through the window is always fun. Just be warned the South American countries each have their own style of preparing empanadas, with regional differences mostly between Bolivia, Argentina and Chile. The empanadas here are definitely Argentinian-style.
