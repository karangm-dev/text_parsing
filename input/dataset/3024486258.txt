My nieces attend GAA and they couldn't be happier! The curriculum and structure seem to be well balanced and challenging, and the teachers are engaging and pleasant. I especially love the innovation GAA uses to send home messages and homework. All schools will have challenges, and it seems GAA is great at tackling issues head on and resolving any conflict.  The teachers are supported greatly by the administrators and all faculty are excellent communicators with the GAA community.
