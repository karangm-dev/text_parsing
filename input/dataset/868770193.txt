Never been to a store like this before but everyone who worked there was very helpful and friendly. Crystal, who helped us, was very knowledgable and professional. She is easy to talk to and knew exactly what we needed. I would not hesitate to go back or to recommend this establishment to someone. Wonderful people work here!!! Love it!!
