Saturday at 6:30PM, place was dead.Ordered the mini chicken sandwich ($2.59), got 2 pc chicken combo and an extra buttermilk biscuit. Biscuits are 99 cents.The bad:Mini chicken sandwich - such a small lame sandwich. Horrible. Don't get this. Just don't. It was bland.Buttermilk biscuits - again, horrible. Tasted like it has been stored away for years and has just been microwaved!! It did taste like an OLD WOODEN CABINET. yes i know what that tastes like. Haha.The good:Coleslaw - for my fiance , coleslaw was the way he likes it. Sweet and creamy, crunchy.2 pc chicken - chicken was good. Juicy. Made to order. Was not greasy. Nothing wrong with the chicken.Service is non-existent.Tip: Just order the chicken and nothing else.Won't be coming back.Review 66 of 100
