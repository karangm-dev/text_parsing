I had an hour wait for my flight so the attendant suggested Winners. I would not call it a winner. I had to wait over 45 minutes between ordering my food and having it delivered to me at my table in a to-go box!!! The food was good but the wait is way too long and it is unclear why the wait is so long unless all of the Winners in the airport share the same kitchen. I was not able to finish my food before my flight so I ended up being the weirdo on the plane the to-go box that everyone is staring at (lol). No more Winners for me unless I have a LONG layover.
