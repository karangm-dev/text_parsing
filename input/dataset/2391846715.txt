I had an absolutely awful experience here.  I had Stephanie as my stylist who I was told was very experienced, but did my color in no way like I had asked for. When I expressed that to her at first she gave me the excuse that it was the lighting in the room. When I talked to the manager of the salon I was also treated like I either wanted a discount, or I was in some way responsible for the work I was unhappy with. The manager and the owner were completely uncaring that I hadn't received the style I had asked for and proceeded to charge me for it anyways. When I continued to complain that this was not acceptable the manager decided to throw me out saying that they couldn't help me and to go back to where ever I had come from. I have never felt so scammed by a salon ever in my life. I will continue to tell everyone I know not to waste there time or money at Tula salon. Now I have to have my color corrected somewhere else which is really sad considering I just had to pay for such shotty work here. I'm a new mom and I don't get to do much of anything nice for myself lately...this was supposed to be a really fun thing for me to get out n try to feel Alittle better after being stuck in the house for months with newborn twins.  It was just such a disappointment it really was an awful experience for me.
