I've been going there for 6 years. Definitely less in the last few years. It's sad to see that the food quality went downhill every time I go. They went from the best orange chicken place to one of the worst. Soggy chicken is worse orange sauce. The lo mein is still decent, sushi is ok and really one of the only sushi options in the area
