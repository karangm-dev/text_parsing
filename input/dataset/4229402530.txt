Okay seriously... how much time have I spent on 17th Ave?!? Years? Decades? A quarter of a century? And still, it wasn't until yesterday that I had ever stepped foot inside Indo-Designer Rugs. One question: WHHHYYY?!?!? What a cool store! I mean, don't get me wrong, it's not like I"m a rug collector or anything, but I can definitely appreciate a beautiful rug. And considering this place carries Nepalese rugs, Indian rugs, silk rugs, Persian rugs, Afghanee rugs, and the list goes on and on, even an amateur rug observer can see that this place is where it's at. Plus, as if that wasn't enough, they also carry artifacts, statues, room dividers, showpieces and interior decorations. This place is absolutely amazing. And it's HUUUUUGE. From the outside, yeah, it looks pretty big, but you walk in, and it goes back as far as the eye can see! It's amaaazing! I will however warn you ahead of time: It costs big money to have things like what they carry shipped to Canada. So yes, everything is pretty highly priced. But keep in mind that artifacts, showpieces and designer rugs are always pricey. And hey, they do have a very thorough clearance section, so if you're on the 'spend-less' regiment, then you can definitely peruse this section and the chances of you seeing something you like are very high. Indo-Designer Rugs makes me wish I had a big mansion to put all these amazing things in. Well, for now, I'll just have to stick to going there to look, but mark my words, as soon as I get my very first luxurious crib, It will be completely furnished courtesy of Indo-Designer Rugs. Lookin' forward to it!
