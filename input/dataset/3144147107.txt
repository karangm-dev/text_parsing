I was told that this place was amazing, however I thought it was overrated. There was of course a super long line and I waited bc my bf really wanted to try it out. It was good, but it wasn't worth the wait. The staff is super friendly so I'll give them that. I wouldn't go back that's for sure.  For an over priced egg sandwich that took way too long, no thanks. I'll take my chances elsewhere. The only reason it has such a hype is bc it's on the strip in the cosmo.
