We recently moved from Avondale to Glendale. We have always loved our Goodyear location so of course we assumed we would love this location. It is nicer and has newer decor from the Goodyear location.We were a table of 6 and they tried to put us in a booth. We saw a table for 6 and requested to sit there. Seemed to annoy two of the waitress's and one even made a comment about it. The food was exactly as we expected and was on point as far as flavor. However, the service is terrible. The servers are rude. For someone who makes their money from tips none of them appeared to be happy about working or going above and beyond to be accommodating. Says on the receipt that our server was Brian but it was a young female. We spent over $150.00 in your restaurant last night and am not sure if we would be returning. Which saddens me since we frequent went to our Goodyear location weekly.
