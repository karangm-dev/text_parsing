By far my favorite Personalized pizza place! Okay I may be biased because MOD started in my hometown of Seattle but still it's the best! The service is so nice and friendly and treat you like a friend. They are quick and efficient! I love that MOD allows you to add unlimited toppings for one standard price! You can either follow their suggested menu pizzas or make one that exactly fits your taste! The pizza is always cooked to perfection. Not too doughy and not burnt! They also have beer on tap and a selection of bottled beers, wines, and other juices/soda. I'm sad there won't be a MOD where I'm moving in Dallas, TX
