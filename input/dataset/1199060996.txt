I spent 15 minutes in the store. Young, lazy salesgirl did not acknowledge my presence nor did she offer to help me. Most likely I would have purchased several items had there been adequate customer service. There are many unique stores on Ellsworth as well as S Highland with excellent salespeople. Skip this one.
