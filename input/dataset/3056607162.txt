I never check out touristy things while on vacation.  This is a def must see!  My friends dragged me out there and it was well worth it.  The fountain show goes to the beat of the music that is playing.  Always a big crowd and a nice switch up from the fast pace things of Vegas.  Check it out you won't regret it!
