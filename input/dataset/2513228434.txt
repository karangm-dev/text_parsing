I live in Summerlin and we drove all the way to my old neighborhood in the Eastside of town just to come eat here. I absolutely love their fresh drinks they carry, the food, and desserts. I'm honestly surprised that it still has the same rich flavor and the fact that it actually expanded, because next door where they are now it used to be a very old beat up bar. The menu also got a little bigger since I last came here seven years ago which is great! The pricing is also fair so you won't get a heart attack over the overpriced items like other stores in town similar to this place do. We got three large fresh drinks, two desserts, and two corn cups for only $24! Definitely will be coming back around here again soon.
