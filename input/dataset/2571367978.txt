Came on a Saturday morning and no problem getting a table on the patio. We absolutely loved all the food and the service was very friendly and quick! The Hawaiian French toast was so good! The chocolate chip pancake we had for the table was amazing. My husband really liked his breakfast San which on a croissant and my dad loved the hearty skillet. You really can't go wrong!
