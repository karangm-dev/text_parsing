This is my go-to place for snacks/dessert/chillage time =). I've been introducing this place to friends and family ever since they opened. Best popcorn chicken hands down. I also love their ginger milk tea and snow ice dessert. Cakes are also pretty good. Would definitely recommend getting there early on Friday/Saturday/Sunday evenings as they don't take reservations on weekends.
