Went to this place for the first time Friday night. I was underwhelmed. The flavors were very limited. The vanilla tasted like milk ice. The toppings were very messy and it was kind of hard to tell which flavor was which. After going to yogurt shops in California this ship is seriously lacking. Probably will never go back.
