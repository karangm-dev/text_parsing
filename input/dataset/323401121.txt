I went here today for some coffee and maybe something to eat.  The door was opened for me upon approaching it, and I was warmly greeted by a man who I assumed to be the owner.  That was awesome.Getting inside, there are children crawling around on the ground and on furniture, literally screaming... and it smells.I walked up to the counter and a girl said "hi," I said, "hi," and I looked  up at the menu to see what I wanted... I kept looking and kept thinking and she remained silent and just stared at me.... this is not the kind of service I expect at a coffee shop... maybe some suggestions, or questions... "so is this your first time here?" would have been nice.  Just silence.I ended up just ordering a toddy, and it was okay.  I prefer the ones from Cartel most definitely though. I went to throw my straw wrapper away and the counter with forks and condiments and sugar and whatnot was visibly sticky and gross.  There was a bin with a sign over it reading "dirty dishes," that was indeed FILLED with dirty, smelly dishes.The owner thanked me and said goodbye on my way out.
