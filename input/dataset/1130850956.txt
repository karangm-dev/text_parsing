My husband and I dined here last week during a quick trip to Vegas. Our dining experience was wonderful. The server was very attentive and quick with recommendations! The food and drink were delicious.But, my review is about Yaz, the manager. In our haste to get to a concert, we left dinner in a hurry and without our credit card. We didn't notice until we arrived back home in Seattle the next day. Of course, we were panicked and tried to retrace our moves the night before. We realized we left the credit card at SushiSamba and called to see if the restaurant could help us get the card back. Not only did Yaz help us by taking our multiple phone calls, he saw through that the card was sent back to us. He was very patient throughout the process, and we are very appreciative of his follow-through. Definitely saved us a lot of inconvenience by going above and beyond to provide exceptional customer service! We will definitely come back during our next trip to Vegas in June. Thanks, Yaz!
