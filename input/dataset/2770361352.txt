My wife had the Italian sub. I had a Philly steak and cheese. No taste. Not really Italian bread. Specifically told them no peppers or onions. Guy starts to prepare my sandwich WITH green peppers (which I hate), then proceeds to actually pick them out. When I confronted him about it, I told him I wanted him to make me a new sandwich. I didn't want him picking out stuff. Come on... dump the sandwich and make a fresh one correctly as I ordered. A step up from awful Subway, but just barely. Asked for a to-go menu and they were out. Really?  Went during lunch on a Friday. We were the only ones there. What does that tell you?And came home, where I proceeded to get sick to my stomach. Something in the sandwich did not agree with me. Won't be returning. Doesn't anyone out here know how to make a hot oven grinder or a good sub sandwich?
