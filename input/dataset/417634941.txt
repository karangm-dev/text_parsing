This place is fantastic!!!!  Great food, great customer service and great pricing.The owner Dennis has this place firing on all cylinders.  He has nailed the food quality and role models how all restaurant owners should run their business.I had the Surf and Turf Shaken Beef.  Words cannot describe how good this dish was....an unbelievable sauce.I highly recommend you visit this restaurant!!!!
