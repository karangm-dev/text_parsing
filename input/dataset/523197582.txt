I just resigned my lease earlier this month for another year. I really regret my decision to stay. In the year I have lived here I have had nothing but problems mostly with maintenance but lately with the leasing office. I've had maintenance in my apartment without permission and without living notice they were even there or that they fixed the problem. With the leasing office the lost one of my money orders from June and beginning of October I was made aware of a past due amount on my account. When the leasing office confirmed they did not cash that money order I was told I had to pay to retrieve my money and I was only offered sorry this was a mistake made from previous management. This place could care less about their residents, they have no clue how to run their office and the people who work there are constantly changing therefore no one knows what to do. I would never recommend this as a place to live to anyone.
