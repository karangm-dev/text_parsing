Unbelievable customer service and know how from Heather White, one of the bankers there. She is extremely knowledgeable, professional and down to earth.The rest of the staff was also very respectful, they made me feel comfortable and showed they care for the customer. The place is very nice inside, super clean, nicely decorated, very inviting. Brand new computers and printers, clean bathroom nice sitting area, well lit.I never heard about this place before. I will be closing all my accounts at my 2 other credit unions and just deal with Vantage West. I will also be recommending it every chance I get!
