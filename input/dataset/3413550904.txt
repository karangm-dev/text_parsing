Walking up to the entrance of Bob Taylor's Ranch House, you are either going to think it is a piece of history or a piece of sh*t. The building is so old, I wouldn't doubt if your great great great great great great grandpa grew his first pube in it. All joking aside, Bob Taylor's Ranch House has been in business since 1955 so they must be doing something right. Right? Beano Fatardo investigates.First of all, you will get cancer the second you walk into Bob Taylor's. Even with just a few customers, the place reeked of everyone's favorite combination : stale cigarettes and fresh cigarettes. On top of that, the place was dark, dingy, and depressing. I felt like I was in an old bowling alley. The only difference is that old bowling alleys serve somewhat edible food.Not only was my hamburger a once frozen patty, the steak fries had less flavor than water. I would have loved to try the coleslaw instead of the fries, but it wasn't prepared yet! Why do I have a feeling the cook is on a morning-long smoke break..... inside the restaurant!?The only reason I am not giving Bob Taylor's a single star is because the bacon on my burger was nice and thick. That has to account for something, right? In the end, Bob Taylor's Ranch House isn't even good enough for Pittsburgh Steeler fans. And I hear they eat old pee-soaked newspapers.
