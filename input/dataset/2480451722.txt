Don't go here! Yes they are known for "quick service" and that is about the only pro Jimmy John's has going for itself. They are very strict on how they will make your sandwich, one you are PAYING for, and they wont listen to what you want. Example was I wanted one of their sandwiches that comes with salami, capicolla,and ham.. Being allergic to ham I requested to have turkey subbed out... I was then told "sorry we can not do substitutions"... When I explained the reasoning one of the employee's said "well we can not put ham on it, but we will have to charge you $2 for turkey"... To which of course was like well where's my discount for taking off the ham? And they said that this was how it's done and no alterations are allowed.Now I can understand if i'm asking to add turkey on top of everything else, or if I asked for double meat... Yes charge me extra... But for them to be so rude about this, I would much rather go a little farther to Jersey Mikes where they happily help me with no issues with my allergies.
