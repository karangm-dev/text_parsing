You would think that they would keep in mind that getting married is very special, but from the way we were treated, I don't think they care. First off when I called to get an appointment they asked me what my budget was and weren't friendly. We arrived and they were rude and rushed me out after trying only 2 dresses and kept mentioning how they are highly in demand and always booked. To be honest, their dresses aren't great and are not customizable either. Very disappointed with the service. Would not recommend to anyone
