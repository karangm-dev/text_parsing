When I moved to Nevada, i searched for a shop that I could trust.  Unfortunately it took me a few years before I discovered Nationwide Safety Brakes and Alignment Center, and I felt like I was being taken advantage of at the other places.. its been about fifteen years, and I have only taken my cars here. Pete always listens to what i have to say when I am describing the problems, and will ask questions that help him get an understanding of what I an trying to explain. I always feel like he is being truthful with me, and never like he is trying to sell me something that I don't actually need.  I take my cars here, and only here, for everything, not just alignments. Although one time I needed a muffler, and Pete referred me to his favorite muffler shop, but other than that I only go to Nationwide Safety Brakes and Alignment Center.
