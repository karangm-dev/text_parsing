Had a business breakfast at the main lobby restaurant (The DJT) at the Trump Hotel.Had to wait 30 minutes for a table for 6 at 8:00 AM and there was not much of a line. Understaffed. The Starbucks coffee was OK, but the Eggs Benedict were just OK and at $16 a pop more than a bit overpriced IMHO. Once we were seated the waitstaff did their best but overall would have been better service in a blue plate diner on Main Street in Anytown USA. Not impressive for what seeks to be a worldclass hotel.Hotel rooms are nice but will have breakfast somewhere else tomorrow.
