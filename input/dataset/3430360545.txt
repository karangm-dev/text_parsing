Run for your life!! stay far away from this so called restaurant! As a Persian food admirer I have never had such terrible meal. I came there with my boyfriend for a fun night and we both had agonizing stomachache for a whole day after eating their food!! We ordered Mirzaghasemi  and Vaziri (chicken bbq and koobideh) which are of my favourite Persian foods. The Mirzaghasemi tasted like dog puke mixed with garlic. absolutely disgusting taste. funny enough the table next to us were complaining about their food as well. After waiting for half an hour we got the bbq and first thing we noticed was a hair sticking to our bbq. beyond gross but we didn't want to ruin our night so we just picked it out and tried to forget it ever happened. The bbq was completely uncooked inside but the outside was burnt burnt!! we asked them to cook it some more as the Koobideh was super rare!! after the bbq it some we tried it. this was literally the single most disgusting taste koobideh I ever had in my life. I could still feel the terrible taste in my nightmares!! the saffron chicken bbq was cooked ok but the taste was so bad!!! extremely sour and salty and dry beyond imagination!! before I forget I want to comment on their rice!! they use a super cheap smelly rice that has a horrible after taste!! it's a cheap brand you can find in Persian store!! It's called gold or yellow rice if I'm not mistaken!! it's was like chewing gums!! bottom line is do not go to this place unless you're prepared to waste your time, money and appetite there.
