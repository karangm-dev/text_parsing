I was just looking to see when opening day was and noticed there wasn't many reviews so I decided to share my experience.  We first came here about 6 years ago and loved it.  We love the reindeer and the gift shop, I've gotten quite a few unique Christmas ornaments and snow-globes from there.  The prices may seem high in comparison to getting a precut tree outside a store somewhere, but they're average or a little below average for fresh cut or DIY cut trees.  I love cutting ours down every year and going on the hunt for the perfect tree, it's one of my favorite holiday traditions.  Our tree always stays looking great through the holiday season and we don't get many needles falling off at all.
