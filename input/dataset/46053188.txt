When next looking for something delicious in the easy East, I will definitely return to Brickworks Cider House! Sweet staff, sweeter snacks and the sweetest cider. I popped into BCH with a colleague before a work event and we each had a cider flight. I'm not a huge cider drinker, but I really enjoyed all of the different flavour options. I especially liked their Hawaiian pineapple infused offering. Delish. Along with our ciders we also shared an artichoke dip bread bowl thing. A loaf of crispy, cheesy bread that you tear apart filled with green goodness. It's definitely a full day's calories... but it's worth it.
