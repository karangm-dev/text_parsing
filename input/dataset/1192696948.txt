Pollo Campero is unique in my opinion, another Yelper compared it between Pollo Loco and Popeye's. I think his description was on target. I ordered the three piece fried leg and thigh meal with Campero Beans and Horchata. It came with corn tortillas and a cold dipping sauce that is somewhat like Thousand Island salad dressing. The chicken was flavorful and it was completely cooked unlike the odd KFC. Since I had the dipping sauce I gave it a try and it didn't add or take away from the flavor of the chicken. The chicken was a little bit on the oily side, but once I took a bite I forgot about it. The Campero Beans were out of this world delicious! I only wished they had given me more than two tortillas. It was just like homemade pinto beans and better than Pollo Loco Beans. The horchata was very tasty and it's the type of horchata you get in Los Angeles, very tasty and not watery at all. The ladies working here were very friendly and attentive, despite me getting stuck while ordering. I really think that their spin on fried chicken with yummy sides, and top notch service is why they're successful. I'm glad to have them in North Las Vegas. My overall rating on the chicken is an 8. It's not quite PL, but, it's better than KFC.
