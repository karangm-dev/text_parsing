Harness is a lot like SoulCycle with a more "Ohio/local" feel to it!  Every time I go, I walk out feeling tired but refreshed and ready to take on anything!  My current favorite instructor is Andria but I haven't been to all of the instructors yet.  If you are in the mood for a fun but challenging workout, I would definitely recommend Harness.  I can't wait for them to open the downtown location in March!!!!!!
