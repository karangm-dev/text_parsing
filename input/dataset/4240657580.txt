Never had a problem at this one until today. Guess they were to busy to care about the quality of their food. I ordered my regular Asiago ranch spicy chicken sandwich. Got my food at the window I always do a quality check no matter what, looked at my sandwich and it had honey mustard on it, last time I checked honey mustard and ranch were two different things. So I sent it back, the girl who made it came to the window and argued that it was made correctly. I said no, because Asiago ranch isn't yellow and doesn't taste like honey mustard.  She said I know I made it right I said ok, well I don't want it. So she took it back brought me another one this time a regular chicken sandwich with a ranch packet. Yeah I paid 7 dollars for a ranch packet with a chicken sandwich. Sweet girl right, nasty attitude to boot. So I took it into the store this time, and the manager showed me the ranch in the bottle that was suppose to be on my sandwich and remade it. Wow imagine that someone who new how to make it without attitude. I'm still very disappointed money is money no matter where you spend it at. And I expect to get what I ask for with my money. Not something you just feel like free styling.
