I'm originally from California and I was pleasantly surprised of the efficiency and cleanliness of the in-n-out location. We had Chris as a cashier and he was very friendly and knowledgeable. I was a little disappointed that they did offer roadkill fries which is essentially Flying Dutchman on top of Animal Style fries, but my boyfriend kindly reminded me that each store is different from another. As we waited for our food it was very busy but they were very fast!! I wanted to make a shout out to Ali who was going around and making an effort to make sure all the tables were wiped clean. I've been to over 15 in n outs in my life, I'm happy to know the one near my house is so fantastic. And of course, the food is always amazing.
