I had a Groupon for 80 lashes per eye and by far the best experience I've had. Last time and first time I did lashes, it hurt! You could feel every lash being put on, so I assumed getting lashes were the worst thing possible.This time, BARELY FELT ANYTHING. Natalie put on a natural 12mm look for me which I really liked. I fell asleep for a bit of it. Took about 90min. She was so gentle and caring. Would def come back!!
