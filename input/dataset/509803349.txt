I've been to this restaurant a few times. Never disappoints. Customized pizza before your eyes. Tasty, fresh looking toppings. Ever gone to one of those chain 5 minute joints? This place blows them away. I only hope this place survives the rebranding of the Monte Carlo. The greatest improvement came when they changed from a few dollops of mozzarella to smaller chunks. Makes for better coverage of the cheese. This last time, mine could have used another 30 seconds in the oven - a few chunks of cheese didn't quite melt, but otherwise tasty. Don't forget the staff - I was engaged by 5-6 employees each one was pleasant, friendly and helpful. I recommend you give it a shot.
