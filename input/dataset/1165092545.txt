The food is excellent here and the service was way above average.  Someone said service was poor and I just can't imagine why I thought just the opposite.  Some of the items weren't my favorites (a little heavy) but most delivered what they promised.  This is trendy and upscale so don't expect otherwise but if you are in the mood for a delicious cooktail and tapas then that is exactly what you will get with a big smile.
