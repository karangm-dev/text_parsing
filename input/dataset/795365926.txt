Fresh, clean, ahhhmazing sushi!  Always our "go-to" place.  Quick, friendly service and a great value.  The tuna is always super light and clean.  Our favorites are the Kee Roll, ASU roll, Spider and the Las Vegas.  The calamari is excellent and they have a pungent sauce that is amazing (ask for it).
