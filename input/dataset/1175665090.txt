This outback location really knows how to keep their customers happy. After a slightly bad experience they did everything in their power to make sure my next experience was nothing short of awesome! Michelle is an awesome manager and really knows how to provide great customer service! The food as always was wonderful tonight. I will continue to go to this outback location!
