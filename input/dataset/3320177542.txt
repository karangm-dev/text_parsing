The people working here are awesome.  They are all very nice and helpful unlike at other gyms.  For that reason I give this place 2 stars instead of zero.However, the facilities are in dire need of attention.  Most of the cardio equipment is antiquated.  The showers are f'ing nasty.  I swear it always smells like raw sewage in there.  I'll be showering and I'll be like, wait, did that old guy over there just shit himself?  But no, it's coming from the drains which back up and clog after about three minutes.  I've worked out a system where I switch to another shower stall after a couple minutes so I never have to stand in the nasty gunk that comes up through the drain. If it's not crowded I use 3 different stalls for one shower but there's no way to avoid the overpowering smell of human feces.
