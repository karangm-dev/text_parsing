This place is all around awesome. Food is always great and fresh. The service is always the best in the business and you can tell they really care. They take time to try and get to know you. They always are fast even when they have the line almost out the door. The place is always clean and bathrooms nice. I would give this place a higher rating if I could. PS you have to try the pea and pesto pasta :)))
