This hotel was amazing! I actually booked it online and was traveling from California. Which is a 3 hour time difference. I arrived at the hotel prior to my check in which was at 3pm. Yolanda at the front desk was extremely nice and welcoming. Yolanda was very accommodating to me being there early and suggestions valet parking vs street. The hotel itself was extremely clean and nice! They have a huge bar with plenty of drinks to choose from. Everyone was extremely friendly and made my stay very pleasant and enjoyable. I plan on staying here anytime I am in town for a Cavs game. They are about 0.08 miles for the quicken loans stadium. We literally walked to the arena... I will highly recommend them to anyone in downtown Cleveland !
