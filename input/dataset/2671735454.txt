Every price is about $3 more than retail at a normal store. Games are typically received a week or more after the release date and kept in short stock. The staff is knowledgeable but they show have no competence in dealing with customers. I asked to check a release date for an upcoming game and I was told to wait for the other customers in line to ring up purchases, while several staff members wandered the floor and the second register sat empty. Not the first time I've received bad service, and coupled with the poor pricing and late arrivals I'm totally finished with this store.
