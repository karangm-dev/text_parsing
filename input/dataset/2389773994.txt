This is the best dim sum we've had in North America. Recommended to us by a Chinese Canadian Toronto native who grew up in the Markham, this place is one of our highlights of our trip. We arrived at 1pm on a Monday (Boxing Day weekend) to a completely full restaurant. We waited for about 15 min to be seated. From there, we got a dim sum menu and checked off the items that we wanted.They have plenty of classics but they do it BETTER. In dim sum restaurants of lower quality, I get sometimes sick from eating the highly glutinous meat wrappers or if it's way too oily. Here, everything was very refined AND prepared well. For example, the fried crueler in the rice wrapper was still crispy! How do they do it!Some other favorites - the thousand year old egg congee (very "xi" - we think they blended it with chicken stock), the shumai with quail egg (very special), the shrimp dumplings, the sticky rice wrapped in bamboo (REALLY good flavor), pork ribs, etc. It was good. We will definitely be back!
