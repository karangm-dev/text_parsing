Have to add my voice to the chorus of MBP lovers.  I somehow missed this place in the many times I've been to Madison until a few years ago.Great food, lots of vegetarian and vegan options.  They have breakfast all day and quite a few hot veggie sandwiches.   I finished my meal with banana cream pie, but they have vegan fruit pies and ice cream treats.
