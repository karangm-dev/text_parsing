This review is purely from a visitor / tourist perspective. Visited Madison over the 4th of July weekend. I can see why people choose such campuses. While I wouldn't have appreciated its beauty back then, I do now!! Really beautiful campus!!! Has a serene vibe as well as access to a city vibe / nightlife!! Reminds me of Oak Park, IL. Has that "small town downtown" vibe. We really enjoyed our trip!!!
