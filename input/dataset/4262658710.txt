Had to post another review because I just can't get enough of this place. I've had my eyebrows done by Shaina and Victoria and you just can't go wrong with either one of them. They have slightly different styles but they are both professional and masters at what they do. The front desk staff is also great. They now do eyelash extensions and the pics look great, I'll be trying that service next. I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants to feel and look good. Get your nails done at a nail salon but don't go there for your eyebrows. I'm telling you spend the extra money and go to Pink Cherry for any and all of your waxing needs.
