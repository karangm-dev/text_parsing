We've been to Osborne three times in the past two days. Can you eliminate engraving from the inside of a ring? Yes! We can do it now. (The "other guys" said: Only on Wednesdays.) Can you laser-repair the prongs and resize it? Yes! You need it this week? We'll be sure to have it done by Thursday. Can you remove links from a beautiful new bracelet watch? Yes! We'll do it right away. (The "other guys" who sold the watch said we'd need to take it to a watchmaker.) Every time, the answer is a cheerful "yes" and great, quick service. They even offered a discount for military service that we didn't know was available and didn't have to ask for. We'd definitely go back here again. Thank you!
