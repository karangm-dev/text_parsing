Never ever go here .. I come in asking to remove my current nails and get a full set . First thing the man starts doing is complaining about how thick my nails are .. He was acting like he didn't know how to take nails off . So I then tell him just do a fill in (he already took off two nails ) he proceeds to put straight acrylic on my natural nail without a artificial nail! I didn't ask for that ! I then tell him to take it off and he walked away fussing in Korean and saying someone else will do nail for you .. I left the place , even tho some of the nail techs apologized , I will never ever come here again !!!!
