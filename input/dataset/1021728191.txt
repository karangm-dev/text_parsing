Good Beer. Burgers that are perfect. Excellent service (Matt). Need I say more? It was just what we needed after a day out. I started out with a Black and Tan because I couldn't make up my mind between a Guinness and a Bass. The custom made black and bleu burger was cooked perfectly. Matt, our server, kept us fed and watered and it was perfect. They have something for everyone, especially if you like really good beer on tap. GO THERE! It's right across from the Hard Rock and it's nice to get away from crazy places in LV and chill with good brew and excellent food.
