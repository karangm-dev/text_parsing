The 2 hours spent inside was a mix of adolescence and adrenaline. I felt like a toddler who was taken to the playground for the first time. Learnt a lot, and I had a lot of fun here. Definitely recommend you check this place out with the family or even a group of friends. PS: ask for their student discount!PSS: CMU students get in free!
