Interesting... Lisa P. has provided a canned response which recommends that I contact their "Patient Experience" department. However, I honestly fail to see the value of this. This hospital is deservingly rated at 2 stars, so clearly they must be aware of their shortcomings. The issue is painfully obvious. In my opinion, this hospital needs to raise their standard of care so that their patients are treated with a higher degree of compassion. I'm certain that some of their physicians are truly compassionate, but they need to retrain or weed out those that are not.I have already identified the physician that attended me in the survey I mailed to this hospital. Whereas my Yelp review was merely intended to share my personal experience with others. While on the subject; I can highly recommend Southern Hills hospital and St. Rose Dominican  - St. Martin campus. If Mountain View hospital could ever raise their rating to 4 stars, I wouldn't hesitate to give them another try. Why go to a 2 star rated hospital???
