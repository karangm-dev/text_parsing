Had brunch here this morning with some friends and it was amazing! The weather was perfect so we sat on the patio and it was a really good first experience! The food is amazing I would definitely recommend the breakfast pizza it's really yummy. I had never tried chicken sausage before but wow so good. My boyfriend had the salmon benedict and he loved it! This place is a 10/10 in my opinion!
