I wish I could give -5 stars.  I waited an hour and 45 mins to see the doc, Germaine. He did not say anything about keeping me waiting so long, obviously his time is more important than mine.  He came in with an entourage of med students and did not even ask me if it was ok for them to be present.  I had an  EEG done for epilepsy, when I asked him if should stay on my current meds he told me that was up to my discretion!!  WTF??  He asked me what I do for a living, I told him collision repair and he actually rolled his eyes!!  He just reads test results to you, refuses to explain the medical jargon into plain English.  He talks in circles and never explains your condition, or lack off.  In his best Boris Karloff voice he kept addressing me as "my friend", he was not trying to be friendly, he was being condescending.   I asked him to please address me as Ms. Jones, and he kept saying, "my friend".  I finally had enough and told him exactly what I thought of him. Horrid bedside manner, condescending, nasty, disrespectful, etc, etc.  I told the students that the best thing they could learn from him was how to NOT treat patients.  I was yelling at him, and guess what!, he has a BOUNCER!!!  Really, no kidding!  I was so furious!  I have never been to a doctors office that actually had a freaking bouncer.  I guess I am not the first person to lose my temper in the office.  Run from this office!  Go to the Ruvo Cleveland Clinic, where you are treated with respect and dignity.  Volunteers actually escort you to your doctors office, and give you a nice flower as you leave.  Dr Germaine is a very very nasty man who acts like he is doing you a favor to allow you to be in his presence.  Never again.
