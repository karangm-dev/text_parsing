We had two dinner comps so we decided to eat here for Sunday dinner. My husband and I were covered but I had to pay $44.99 for my 13 year old and 22.99 for my 11 year old! We did not like the food very much. The desserts were a joke. They had like 6 to choose from and didn't taste good at all. I cannot believe that anyone would eat here unless it was for free. I feel bad for people that pay full price!
