Based on the Yelp reviews it had received, we all went to visit Karey's Kitchen yesterday for lunch. This is the second new Filipino place we have tried in as many weeks. The place is very small, but nice and cozy (maybe about the size of Mi Cocina Mi Pais). We went after traditional lunch-rush hours, so it was not too cramped. I'm actually glad they opted for a small location. Several of our favorite places have gone out of business lately due to too much overhead, so it's good they are keeping their expenses low. We had our toddler with us, so we opted for the outdoor seating and all was well.We tried a variety of Filipino dishes and everything was great. I had the chicken adobo and kaldereta--both were excellent, as was the garlic rice I had on the side. My wife and niece, who are both Filipinas, also were impressed with the food--especially the cassava cake, which they raved about. Karey's also offers Mexican-Filipino fusion dishes which we did not try this time, but I might go for an adobo burrito or something next time and update the review. The service was also outstanding--super-friendly and fast. My wife ended up having a very nice long conversation with the owners after our lunch. Living in a Fil-Am household we are always looking for new places to stock up on Filipino food. My wife is a restaurant manager (Panda Express), so the last thing she wants to do at home is cook--and as for me, well if it does not involve fire or barbeque sauce its better that we not go there. So, we order take-out food frequently. Along with Wholly Grill, we now have two new staples. I can tell right now I will be stopping here on my way home from work A LOT!I'm giving Karey's five stars based on the fact that the food was good, the service was fast, and the owners were super-friendly. That goes a long way in my book.
