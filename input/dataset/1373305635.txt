Atmosphere is great, not like your typical Mexican restaurant. I think this place is a little hidden gem. Best cheese dip I have ever had and I loved the odd coleslaw mix to dip the fresh tortillas in! Everything we ordered was delicious including my margaritas. I also like that they have "light" live music to enhance the atmosphere. Will definitely be back!
