A great place to go to satisfy your sweet tooth and Filipino craving. All the treats you may have had growing up all in one place. We stocked up on some  mamon and ensemada but we couldn't resist the halo-halo and ube cake while we were there.Jollibee is also right there for your chicken/spaghetti fix.
