Man. I have eaten here twice and haven't been disappointed. We usually try to come here before a show at the filmore because it is so close and we get sick of the restaurants right by the venue! This time around we got the meat and cheese plate which had a lemon pistachio salami on it (omg-I want more), cherry lamb lollipops, deviled eggs, porkbelly (holy moly this was the best! Crispy, crunchy, sweet and savory), and potato croquettes. We also tried a salty dog and the mucho gusto cocktail. No complaints and a super cute place! Go!
