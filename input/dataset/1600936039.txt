Horrible customer service and some dumb ass rules. So you can't have certain donuts in your dozen. You pretty much have only a limit supply you can pick from and then if you want the other kind you have to pay for the normal dozen plus extra. Way over priced. I've never paid 5-6$ for a donut lol. The two times I've came here they take forever to get to the counter. First time I left because I waited for 5 minutes and no body came up. Second time I got irritated with the chick cause she said I couldn't pick certain donuts to be part of my dozen after waiting like 5 minutes. There was a long line. So I ended up just going to a different donut shop. I'd tell you how the donuts were but I've left both times because of the shit custom service. Would say just go to Krispy kream.
