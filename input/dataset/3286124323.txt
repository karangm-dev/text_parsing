We were looking for a Mexican bakery to satisfy a Pan Dulce craving. On a whim, we found this place and drove down to check it out when we found out that La Purisima was closed on Monday. We were glad to have found San Sebastian and the sweets did not disappoint. On our tray, we pulled a fresh as can be Concha, churro, and a couple of cookies. Everything was excellent and the concha was one of the best I have eaten. I have had Pan Dulce from Chicago to LA and can say that San Sebastian is a top notch choice when in Phoenix.
