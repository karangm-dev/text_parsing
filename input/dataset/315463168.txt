Happy Dog at the Euclid Tavern is the place I take all of my out-of-town friends. Why? Because it delivers on all things Cleveland. Let me explain:1. Music - Every time I've hit up Happy Dog I've been pleasantly surprised by the caliber of music coming from their intimate stage set up. The set, usually consisting of three or four solid acts is totally worth the small cover charge ($3-$5). 2. Hot Dogs and Tots - Remember those "Scantron" test forms you used to fill out in high school? Imagine if every time you turned one of those in, you got a really delicious hot dog and a basket of tater tots. Had that been the case, I sure would have studied harder! Every hot dog comes with unlimited toppings including, but not limited to, mac and cheese, chili, spaggetiOs, french brie, fruit loops, a sunny side up fried egg, and chunky peanut butter. Order a basket of tater tots and choose from unlimited dipping sauces like my favorite, the Brazilian chimichurri or black truffle honey mustard. With all these whimsical options, you may start feeling like a kid again. That is until you see the eclectic beer list...3. The Tavern Part - This Happy Dog location, in comparison to their other spot in Lakewood, also prides itself in being half tavern (I think my uncle Rick is half tavern). The Euclid Tavern, before merging with Happy Dog, was a legendary live music venue, established in 1909. Us Clevelanders who enjoy the depth of our city's musical history can take pride in enjoying a brew next to the stage shared throughout the years by bands like The Pretenders and Green Day. If you live in Cleveland and want to entertain that skeptical out-of-towner, take them to Happy Dog at the Euclid Tavern. It's divey, unique and truly Cleveland.
