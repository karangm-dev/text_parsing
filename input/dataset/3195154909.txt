I love frilly lilly! I specifically go to see Crystal, she is amazing at waxes. Her Brazilians are quick with hardly no pain and my skin is never irritated from the wax. She's also amazing at eyebrows, she really takes her time and is very meticulous. Really any service I've gotten from her has been wonderful and she is delightful to be around even when she's causing you mild pain.
