We saw this place being built and were excited to see it. We don't have many restaurant choices out here in Hendertucky.We went there after a week of them opening which was probably too soon. The girl taking the order was very pleasant and she made sure the order was correct. Her trainer was right behind her keeping an eye on her for accuracy. I had the fish tacos which were good. They kids enjoyed their quesadillas too.My GF, her meal came out wrong twice. The owner came out and entertained the kids by giving them stickers to stick someplace on the wall. We were waiting for him to say something about the meal being made wrong but he never did. It was pretty busy and everyone was still trying to figure out their jobs with it just opening. Maybe the info didn't get to him, who knows.We will be back after its been open a while and hopefully have a better experience.
