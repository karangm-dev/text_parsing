First time here. Parking is not the greatest. Restaurant has a nice atmosphere and was clean. Our service was fast, friendly, and knowledgeable. They do not have a kids menu, but did accommodate with making a small portion of some butter noodles. Coke comes in a glass bottle, which always tastes better! We had their Dolci Diavolo and Italian Stallion to eat. They both were delicious. They had a nice thin, crisp crust with a perfect chat. Best crust I've had on a pizza in a long time!
