Went to find keen winter boots, as Dick's is listed on the keens website as a retailer. Well, the pickins were slim, definitely leaning towards certain brands.... You know which ones, the overpriced kinds that people are willing to pay whatever price is on it just to say they have that brand. No one greeted me, which was unusual. Generally, sales staff are waiting to grab you. Nope. Not at this store. This is a new location around the corner since I don't come here unless it's for a specific purpose. There were at least 12 staff in the store and pretty much standing around as I looked confused. I had to approach someone, rather she wasn't looking where she was going and nearly collided with me. She said nothing until I asked for her help to find women's boots. She only guessed where they would be, didn't call for help, escort me to someone who could, nothing. Then I'm sitting on my phone on their website in the middle of the shoe department for 15 minutes and no one asked me if I needed anything. I sat on the floor in the middle of the main aisle of the store to try on boots to get a sense of the size, another brand in their sales area as you walk in. Again, no one said anything. I'm in the middle of the freaking main thoroughfare of the store, and people passed by me, but no. It was if I was invisible. So Duck's is aptly named.
