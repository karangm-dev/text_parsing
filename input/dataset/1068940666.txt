A friend invited me and my sister to brunch today here and I must say, the food and service was way above my expectations. we ordered waffles and turkey bacon, hash and potatoes with an over easy egg, and a western omelette with grits.  We all ate everything on our plate. The food was made to order and served quickly. The manager came by to see if we were enjoying our meal and to offer us a taste of their banana pudding (which was good). I am looking forward to our next visit already.
