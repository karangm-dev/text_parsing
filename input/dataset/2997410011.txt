Sam and Irene saved my wedding dress shopping day! I flew in from Tennessee to try on a specific Dress because I was meeting my bridesmaids there (one also flying in).  I was set to try it on at the Vegas store.... after a horrible experience there, I found Sam and Irene! They helped me try on the dress I loved that they had and I was convinced it was the dress! Then they helped me pick all the accessories! They were extremely professional and helpful.  Totally not salesy and did a GREAT job! I am extremely grateful for their sweet personalities! Sam helped me order it (after I went back again later in the afternoon and tried it on AGAIN! Ha! I can't wait til it gets here and my man sees me in it! I'm SO excited! :) Thanks again Sam and Irene! You Rock! :)
