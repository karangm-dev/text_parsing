My company hosted a dinner and awards night at the hotel last night and the experience was the best we could have imagined! Working with Kristine Cole was fantastic and the communication was always on point. I walked in to be blown away by the set up and I had compliments on the food all night. I came into work today to be flooded with emails on how impressed everyone was with the presentation. The staff that was there to help us was GREAT! I believe Tim was in charge and he had Anna and one other gentleman with him and they made us laugh and gave us the privacy we needed. We will be back and I will be recommending them to everyone!
