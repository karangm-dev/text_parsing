I have recently returned to The Source Centre and have had the pleasure of receiving Network Chiropractic from Dr. Leo Quan. He is one of the most dedicated individuals I have ever met. Not only does Dr. Quan provide in clinic treatment but he takes it one step further by providing his clients with exercises to help them heal their bodies faster helping them achieve their overall health goals faster. Before receiving Network Spinal Analysis I was experiencing high levels of stress in addition to a knee and elbow injury. After just 3 weeks of weekly treatments my stress levels have gone significantly and my knee and elbow injury are on the road to healing.
