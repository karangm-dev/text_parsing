I'd have to say that Jerry's nugget is a hit or miss casino. I've come to play here a few times and found more losses than wins. One thing that I found  problematic was the difficulty of finding a waitress on the floor. The waitress also would not serve me a drink because I was not playing at that point she finally showed up. I actually was playing, but stopped for a bit. If she was in the vicinity 2 minutes before, she could have watched me lose quite a bit of money. I understand this policy, but other casinos don't seem to have a problem as long as you are tipping the waitress. If I'm going to pay for a drink, I will go to the bar because they will make it better if you pay for it.  They do have a decent variety of games here, but considering the service it's not worth a trip to the shadier part of town.
