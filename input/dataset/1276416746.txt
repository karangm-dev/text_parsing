Oh, Bonterra. I wish I made more money and could eat your food every day. This beautiful restaurant, located in an old church, is definitely one of Charlotte's best. I've been there twice - once during restaurant week and once with my dad and boyfriend. Restaurant week was great - I had the soup of the day (a carrot something, it was divine) and the mahi-mahi (also amazing), and a peach tart (good). Didn't think that meal could get much better, until my second visit.We started off with a bottle of Malbec. Solid. The wine list is extensive but pretty pricey. We shared the tomato basil dip (a little too whipped for my taste, but the guys loved it), some olives, and proscuitto. The house-baked bread, prepared fresh every day, is fabulous. I had the Arctic Char with risotto and mole sauce. To be honest, I was a little wary. Mole with char? I thought it would be too heavy or overwhelming. Instead, it was amazing. The char was perfectly cooked with a little crust on the outside. And OMG the mole. Oh that mole will be in my dreams. My dad had the ribeye and loved it; my boyfriend had the veal porterhouse and enjoyed it, as well. We were stuffed, but split the creme brulee for dessert which was, you guessed it, pretty darn good.That char, though...man oh man, get yourself to Bonterra now.
