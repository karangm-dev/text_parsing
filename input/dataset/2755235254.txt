I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. I took my car in THREE days ago, when I called they said they would be able to get my car in right away, and so I took it in the early afternoon, they told me they would look at my car and call me when they knew what was wrong. Later on that day they said I was gonna have to leave it over night and they would call me the next day. Never called. I ended up calling 5 times , yes 5 times and they never returned my calls or told me what was wrong. The lady I spoke to even PROMISED me she would call before the end of the day. Lol. Nope. Cant keep their word for nothing. On the 3rd day they were finally able to tell me they could replace my thermostat but couldn't guarantee that would fix the problem,... which it probably would. Lol & they wanted to charge me over $200 just for that. That's way overpriced and a easy repair. Keep in mind I have a subie which are great cars. Anyways I was fed up, because I know for that it's anywhere from $90-130 I told them forget it. Went and got my car, it took them over 25 minutes to give me my car back and then they really tried to charge me a fee for the diagnosis, hahaha. You said your time wasn't free but me not having a car for 3 days wasn't free either. What a joke!! Never will I be back here or recommend my friends here.
