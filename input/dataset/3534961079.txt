A typical day out to lunch with my girlfriend turned out to be a embarrassing experience I'll never forget. We started out with water and chips and queso. Now we were extremely hungry so we wanted something quick. Now when our waitress came back we put in an order for another appetizer which was the triple Dipper. Now time went by and our triple Dipper was delivered and yet she never asked if we were ready to order. No big deal. I then proceeded to call her over so that we could order soft drinks and again she never asked if we were ready to order. Again no big deal. So again I called her over to tell her we were ready to order and she looked confused and said "oh well what can I get you" well my friend and I wanted to share our plates and we were looking forward to an afternoon of gorging out and enjoying each other's company. So as she proceeded to go on with ordering the three meat deal that y'all had which consisted of the ribs smoked sausage and Crispers. When she was done she proceeded to tell me to go ahead and order and our rude waitress decides to stop us  right there and tell us very loudly  that "that was a lot of food" she proceeded to tell us "she'll give us what ever we want" but, "I'm just saying that's a lot of food" how embarrassing is it for your server to make you feel embarrassed about what you want to order. We decided to get up and leave right at that moment we offered to pay our bill and spoke with the manager and he told us not even to worry about our bill and just to go ahead and walk out and then he apologized for what had happened. I will never step foot in that Chili's again. I have never felt so humiliated in my entire life time and I was at that very moment.
