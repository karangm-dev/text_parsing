The food was terrible, not just bad but terrible. Ordered hot and sour soup, which was so bland it tasted like nothing, despite looking amazing. The BBQ pork buns were edible, but not dim sum as advertised but rather a dry baked pastry type dough. My husband ordered some spicy noodle soup that was also flavorless and not event a hint of spice. I'm really surprised the place was busy and the other reviews were good, I would never recommend this place. I left the place grumpy, hunger and out of pocket $25.
