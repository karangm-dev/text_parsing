This place is great! I get the BBQ burrito every time and it's awesome! The portions are huge and include your choice of two sides which are delicious. Mac and cheese is my favorite. This place reminds me of a chipotle where u walk up and order exactly what you want down the line which is great for the fast paced lifestyle or if you just want to sit down and have a nice meal. Also, the sauces are delicious. Try them all.
