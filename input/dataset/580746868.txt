Though I am middle aged and generally wary of anything "family friendly", my fiancee and I loved this.  I was much happier with the seats and performance than with Penn and Teller.  As someone who has performed an illusion or two, I thought Mac's performance was flawless.  By far the best solo performance I've seen in Vegas of any kind.  Will definitely go again and figure out how to reward someone who could clearly charge more but keeps the cost down for families.  My fiancee found that Mac exuded the most positive "goodness" she has seen, and I agree that nobody's presence has reminded me more of Yoda's statement "luminous beings are we, not this crude matter".
