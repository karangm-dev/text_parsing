We ordered a chicken gyro, Akropolis fries and a Spinach, Ricotta Pizza. The Chicken pita and Akropolis fries were our faves. Pita was soft, chicken was tasty and tender, veg was fresh and the sauce was excellent. The fries were fresh and so hot we couldn't touch them when they first came. The toppings on fries were so tasty. It's a great fry dish. In comparison to the gyro and fries, the pizza was less dazzling. It was a good size for a large and had plenty of ricotta, which was impressive, but not very flavorful. I didn't taste any of the garlic herb sauce the menu said it was topped with. The pizza actually needed a little salt to bring out the multiple flavors. Delivery guy was early and friendly. We will definitely be ordering from this  pace again!
