Cozy little place. Good service. Albiet the amount of food you get depends solely on who is serving you. The one for us was quite miserly. For $38 the food I got was barely more than a small cup poke bowl. I had the spinach base while the second was rice base. It was 80% rice with sprinkling of food on top. I saw other servers being consideraly more generous. Barely any chicken, a spoon of avocado, spoon of Pineapple salsa, jalapenos, spinach, sauce. $18. There were a couple of other ingredients I'd added, I forgot which ones. I don't mind paying $20 for a poke bowl. At least the amount should be good enough to feel a little full. This was frugal. Not bad taste wise. But frugal. An no cream / reg milk. for the coffee. Only 3.2% milk, coconut and almond milk.
