Pickle Bill's has really gone down hill over the last few years. The menu by far is over priced! Very expensive Coconut Shrimp dinner in which several of the shrimp were soggy and gross on the inside. Ordered the vegetables which were so far from fresh that Gordon Ramsey would throw a fit! Veggies were mushy and who knows how old they were. And don't even think about paying with a Visa gift card because they won't accept it (Where was that posted?) No big deal but just a heads up.I see no reason to visit Pickle Bills again. I have had more affordable and better quality crab legs and seafood dinners at a local bar in Willoughby.
