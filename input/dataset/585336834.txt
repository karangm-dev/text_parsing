Soooo AWESOME!I had a party for my 50th birthday in Jan 2017 at a vacation rental home in Apache Junction, AZ.DaVonna worked with my party planner and I very closely. She met with both of us two months prior to the event, guided us through our thoughts and what could be done on location for my guests. In the end, DaVonna and her team provided full body messages for 13 ladies from across the USA, and ALL were very satisfied.I have now arranged an appointment with DaVonna for my husband, who has a terrible grapefruit size knot in his back - and an appointment for my son, who has a recent high school sports injury.I know DaVonna will take very good care of them as well.Best Wishes~ Laura in Queen Creek, AZ
