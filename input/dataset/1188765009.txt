Very slow and poor service, and they were not very busy. 15 minutes after sitting down I flagged our server down as we kind of wanted to order drinks and she made a bad face.  15 minutes after ordering those drinks weer had to flag a different person down to ask about the drinks because our server wad not in sight.  Things improved after we complained to the manager, that didn't change the fact that the food was not very good.  Won't be going back for sure.
