Do you want to know what heaven smells like? For real. Just peace, love, joy and all that is good in the world? Walk in the door of the Savory Spice Shop, y'all... lolOkay, once you sprinkle a spice from one of the tasters into your hand, you just throw it on the ground after tasting... And the mixture of all that yumminess is enough to get you so excited about all the super things that await you... I am officially addicted to the Ghost Pepper Salt that I found... It's absolutely fantastic... The perfect thing to add some heat to an otherwise okay dish... I actually put it on my popcorn, which works out great if I don't want to share...They offer cooking classes, they are willing to teach you anything you want to know about the products, they offer suggestions on how to use them (that have turned out delicious in my experiences: BBQ rub on roasted cauliflower and broccoli? Yep, it was awesome.) and they have a website full of recipes...You're gonna spend a pretty penny, but one taste from here and that stuff from the grocery store just won't cut it anymore...  Well, you'll still use that grocery store stuff probably, but you'll definitely be able to see the difference once you've had these.
