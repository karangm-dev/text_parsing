I've been scammed. Booked this with my Groupon, I am on my way to the site and 5 minutes before arriving they sent me a text saying their guide called in "sick" and we were forced to cancel. Regardless, there was nothing on the "site", no trails, no business. Started heading back, bummed out, stop by to take some pics and not make a loss on our trip close to Nelson's Landing and asked some locals about the "Horseback Riding" business. It does no exist; this is fraud. Silly me, didn't check for other reviews before giving them my card info and letting them charge me a "Sunset fee." Luckily, as soon as I got home I contacted Groupon, and they refunded my money, the Groupon money, not the "sunset fee". They charge all sorts of fees, "weekend fee," holiday fee," etc. They claim their phones are too busy therefore it's best to text them. So knowing that it was fraud, I texted to see when I would be able to reschedule. They said 'when are you next available,' I said the next morning. They texted back saying they didn't do rides on 4th of July because of fireworks and safety concerns, regardless you can schedule at various times for this day on their website. I texted, so when are you available. Never received an answer. Please do not even think about it.I'm a sucker for good reviews but this had me in awe.
