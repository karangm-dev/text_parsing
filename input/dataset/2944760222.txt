Professional, super clean and high-quality gel manicure! Claire was great and the entire staff was welcoming and fun. Will definitely be back for more services. I walked in early in the day, but they do highly recommend appointments over walk-ins. This place is worth the few extra dollars for high quality and long-lasting work.
