I love what Bonnie Brooks the former CEO has done to revive The Hudson Bay Stores. I had the pleasure of shopping at Lane Crawford in Hong Kong, another place Bonnie has left her fingerprint.  The Hudson Bay was my go to store 15+ years ago and I stopped shopping their about 10 years ago as they began to diversify too much and became and expert at nothing including fashion. Bonnie, the former CEO of Hudson Bay has started a transition back to its roots and bringing in a lot of high end exclusive lines and departments including reviving The Room at its flagship location and as a result,  gone is the TV department and other high maintenance low profit lines. I do find myself suddenly dropping in to see what is new and always seem to walk out with a purchase. Good show Bonnie, nice to have you back in Toronto.  I hope the new CEO has the same clear vision Bonnie had while at the wheel.
