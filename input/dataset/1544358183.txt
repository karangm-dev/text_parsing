Extremely disappointed.I order the large bouquet for my mom.  The bouquet was delivered timely, however the bouquet was piecey, missing flowers and different flowers were used in the bouquet from the on-line picture!I called 800flowers and rep said she will send out another bouquet...???  so my mom will have a mediocre bouquet next to a better looking bouquet? The shock and awe factor was destroyed.
