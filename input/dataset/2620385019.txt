It is such a pleasure to be a customer when the owner and staff make you feel wanted and welcome, vs wanting your money!  Each time I call to place a takeaway order and each time I visit makes me smile because I know the other person is smiling too.  The pizza itself is delicious and fresh and boasts a crust that is chewy and crisp (how is that possible?); everything tastes just as good the next day.  Prices are competitive with other pizza joints around town -- a large pizza is $19.99 and is sliced into 8 big pieces -- but you may get MORE for your money here, due to the wonderful customer service included in every order.
