I'd like to have given this place 2.5 stars. Some very good elements and some very poor ones as well. We did their defused room.First the good... With the use of a groupon the price was very reasonable. The room had decent decorations and good technology. Two of the clues were very smart and a lot of fun to solve.The negatives... Other clues had no basis in logic. We spent 20 minutes trying to solve a single clue and when we were given the answer it was hard not to be really angry. I don't believe that many people if anyone would have jumped to the silly conclusion of how to get the correct answer. The person who ushered us into the room gave us information that was very misleading. Finally our room was right next to another, which is of course fine, but they had a large group just outside our room who were loud for almost 10 minutes of our time. They certainly should have been kept in the lobby area. Once in the room they were still very loud, but I imagine not much can be done about that.Back to the positives, the employees asked us what we thought and seemed to care about our constructive criticism. It seems as though they're willing to make changes based on feedback.Ultimately, I don't know if I'll go back again for a second try. They did enough well that I'm tempted, but enough wrong so I might not waste my time.
