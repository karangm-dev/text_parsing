I love how the simplest things garner the most stars on yelp---how else should things be? Bellagio the fountain is nearer 5 stars than the hotel, probably because a Yelp Elite member gave it one star because they're blaming getting sick in Vegas on a strange allergy they have to teflon on the stove tops in the rooms.So, a mere ten minute fountain show with music ranging from classical to showbiz Leonard Bernstein, this is for sure a must-see in Vegas. It's one of the many throw-ins offered to everyone on the strip, and you've never quite seen anything like it. Vegas seems to have an obsession with wasting water, but they do it in such an aesthetically pleasing way that you just have to say "Sin City's really got it all".Actually, it's a good place to hang out and gaze up at the night sky at the Cosmopolitan, Paris, Aria and other luminescent eye candy scraping the man-lit heavens around you. Extra bonus vibes if you're rolling or getting folkloric.If nothing else, light up a cig and see if you're handheld lasts the whole ten minutes. Nice way to gauge whether you should change brands, yea?
