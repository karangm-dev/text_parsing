It's a terrible experience. I bought six warranties with it. They changed my policies in early 2017 without letting me know. I only found out in August. The service specialist I worked with  claimed that I was notified. In early October, I wanted to cancel the home warranties with HLWP. I mailed the cancellation letter as requested. It took HLWP four months to finish the cancellation process and send me the refund. Because of that, they only refunded me portion of the money.
