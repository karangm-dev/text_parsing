Have been going here since moving to Phoenix 1 1/2 years ago. Previous visit was given wrong order (1 item). Few days later mgr issued a credit to use at later date. Went back few nights ago prior to dinner rush. After waiting 35 minutes asked clerk for my food (again 1 burrito). Was advised given to wrong person, but found it for me. Got home again with the wrong item. While there during my lengthy wait noticed many people returning orders that were filled wrong. Food here is good, NOT great & definitely not worth being abused continually by the inept staff. Phoenix is loaded with great Mexican food & this one is not worth a return visit.
