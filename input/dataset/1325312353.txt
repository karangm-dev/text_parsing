Absolutely some of the worst customer service I've ever had.  First they repeatedly "lost" the credit card numbers we had on file.  Then they sent the wrong order and argued endlessly with me about fixing the problem rather than taking any responsibility.  At first they wanted us to pay for a whole replacement order, and then begrudgingly offered to send the correct order only if we paid additional expedited shipping.  Later, after spending all day desperately trying to get this resolved to get the medication our pet needs and which will run out because of their error, the supervisor, Summer, called me back to say that in fact she wouldn't even deal with me because it was my wife's name on the order and not mine, despite the fact that I had placed the order in question and they had taken my credit card number and charged it.  She basically told me they don't believe me that I placed the order for what I say I did, despite the fact that our cat cannot take what they sent.  If only they spent even a fraction of the energy on customer service that they do on obstructionist tactics and refusals to take accountability for their actions.  Avoid at all costs.
