I am here in Phoenix on Vacation and was told to visit this place. I am 100% Mexican, and I must say there is nothing "Authentic" about this place. The food was horrible, they couldn't make a simple Chicken Quesadilla. We had a party of 6, and not a single person liked their food. We paid $60 and only took two bites. Their silverware was dirty, there was a bug in one of the drinks. I'm not a picky eater or a person who likes to complain, but for the rating this place had we were all expecting a whole lot more. Never, ever coming back. I suggest you don't waste your time either.
