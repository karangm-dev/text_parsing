Don't judge a book by it's cover.  The outside doesn't look so great, but you go inside and it's gorgeous.  The food is some of the best food I've ever eaten.  Their sugar cane chicken appetizer is fantastic!! The pad thai, chiang mai noodles, pad kra po, pad lard na, etc.  This place is so flavorful with fresh veggies and fresh herbs.  And don't get me started on their fried honey banana dessert.  The best dessert I've ever had!  Check this place out you will not be disappointed.
