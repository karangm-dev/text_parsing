Got the most horrible service from a sales rep and the sales manager.  They were both dishonest and unethical in their sales method.  When I caught them in their lies they both became defensive and aggressive in nature.  They are not professional all.  I would refer to them as snake oil salesmen.  Please stay away from this dealership at all cost.  This is my professional opinion.  If you want to get ripped off come to this dealership.
