All around the merchandise is on the expensive side but that's a given personally I like Hot Topic but this particular location has been giving me problems lately.  The last few times I've gone they've been so packed it's ridiculous,  with 3 people working at the register but only one serving people the line is  atrocious then you get to the front and find that the cashier is new and has no ides what they're doing. And this is only one complaint.    Next ordering and going for pick up is a major production. The took over 20 minutes  to find me package on back storage. And calling up to find out if your package has arrived is not a good idea they put me on hold for over 15 minutes then when I called back the line was continuously busy. I called back 2 hours later and was told to hold right away only to wait 5 minutes then the hung up on me. I have been a regular at this particular location for years now and the service has gone way down. I've never been pushy or arrogant just the patient customer happy when I get what I asked for and not thrown aside like trash but that seems to be what this location has become,pretty trashy. I think I'll be discontinuing my loyalty to this branch of Hot Topic.
