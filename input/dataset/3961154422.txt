I stopped in with my daughter around 10:30 am on Thursday. They were busy. But it was not but a few minutes wait for a table. Friendly servers... Always smiling. Very efficient but of course the best part is the food! Portions overly generous. Tasty! I got the Bacon Scramble that was on special. It was excellent. Just the right amount of fresh delicious ingredients. I could not better myself at home. It was priced at $8.99 and well worth it with choices of potatoes and a bread or pancake. I got the biscuit and hashbrowns. Yum. My daughter had the two egg deal that came with a waffle . Would recommend this place to anyone for good down home cooking and great service. I've been to two locations. Both consistently GOOD!
