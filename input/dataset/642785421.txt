In the beginning of my quest about 2 years ago I was with a different management company that was charging me to much for everything from the Maintnace calls to regular  management  things  like posting notices etc. One day I got up and I decided to switch I did my research although the reviews on yelp where not the best for triumph over the phone they seemed like the most well put together management co especially with the online budget tracking devices they offered me it was most convenient for me because I live in California !! Kami gave me the individual attention I wanted so I definitely give TPM 2 thumbs up
