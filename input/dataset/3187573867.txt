Yesterday I came to this location for the first time and ordered the crispy club salad for lunch. It was so good that I got another one for dinner, and am now back again today for my third. Delicious! The location is clean and nicely decorated. Yes, there were teens staffing the location last night, but I don't see this as an issue (unlike some other reviewers). It's not fine dining, folks, so stop expecting it to be. I'll keep coming back for sure!
