I purchased a GroupOn as a gift for my wife who has always wanted to learn to knit.  . My wife loved the store and the environment that seems to foster learning and group project help.    She attended the basic knitting class.  The class was a well sized group of 8 students and the instructor gave very personalized instruction and training to every student..  She was organized, patient and cognizant of the fact that this was a basic knitting class where for many if not all students this was their first experience at knitting.This is truly a great example of a wonderful small business that puts the customer first.
