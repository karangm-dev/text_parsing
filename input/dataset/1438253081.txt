Fish tacos are very good however. I watched them handle my ready to eat food and others with bare hands. She was also in the back sniffling and wiping her nose on her sleeve and even went as far as throwing a piece of food in her mouth.I saw her touch many things and never washed her hands. I sent my food back and asked for it to be prepared while wearing gloves, and with a blank stare and no apology she did. Probably won't go back but if this type of thing don't bother you have at cause the food is good.
