ok if you are looking for amazing home cooked Italian food in the Valley then this is the place to go! The food is simple and amazing! I personally love the eggplant with noodles and their pizzas which are stunning! It's a small place and expect to wait for quality but they do accept phone in orders-so call ahead!
