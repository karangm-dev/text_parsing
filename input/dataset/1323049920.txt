We stumbled upon this gem before attending an event nearby. Loved the decor and the sliding tabletops. The food was amazing. I had the Hippie toast and eggs. My only "complaint" would be it came with hot sauce on it which was not mentioned on the menu. For me this wasn't a huge problem but there are people for whom it would be. My colleagues had "Just the burger", fish and chips, tortilla soup, pulled pork poutine, and eggs Benedict. All the dishes received rave reviews. The man who ordered the fish and chips wished he had only ordered 1 piece as they were so big (but delicious) and the pulled pork poutine was "ok" but nothing you couldn't get elsewhere. The picture is of my Hippie toast and eggs. All in all I would highly recommend this pub, actually I already have to friends who live in Calgary.
