Opinion of this place changed a bit . Their good is great but at 530 on Saturday evening they were closed. Their published hours are till 8. Nobody answered the phone so thinking they were Super busy drove around the corner to place order they were closed. People inside cleaning. At the same time 4 other people pulled up to get food also. I find this to be not good for business by not sticking to published hours
