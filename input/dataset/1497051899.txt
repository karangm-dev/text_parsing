So, why 5 stars. Well, first of all I loved the ambiance. It was an overcast, dreary day in PHX. Yet, inside this place was just really nice. My waitress, Victoria, was a 5+. I had the crab louis which was really good. And I had the Manhattan clam chowder which actually had a spice to it: surprise!!!Think of where it is and what it is and you have to give it a 5.
