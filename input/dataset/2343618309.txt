This is my "go to" spa in Las Vegas! My husband and I are spa fanatics and have been to a multitude of spas in LV, and although some spas are hit or miss, Green Valley Ranch never disappoints. Pros:1. We've never really had an issue booking appts, even when calling same day (always a plus, since we are not good at planning ahead)2. We've had a ton of different massage therapists, and they are always great! 3. There are multiple co-ed areas  (outdoor pool/jacuzzi area, inside hot tub, outdoor fireside lounge area)4. No matter when we've been there, the spa never seems overcrowded or busy5. 20% locals discount 6. If you have kids, Green Valley Ranch now has a Kids Quest (super fun daycare facilities) that you can drop them off at! (score!!!)Cons:Honestly can not think of anything wrong with this spa!
