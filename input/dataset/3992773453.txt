The first time I tried their cakes was from my friend's birthday party. I started to fall in love with their cakes. They are so yummy, with creamy filling, and I especially love the chocolate cake, it's really really rich!! They have some nice cookies with nuts ,and  tastes really good. They also have very cute sugar cookies with colorful icing on top. They look so attractive and the kids will never say no to them. Their macaroons taste very good too, my daughter adores them!!They also have some mini cakes (look like lollipops) with very cute designs and I really had a hard time to choose what I like. They have lots of choices!!The service is superb!! They will give you suggestions of what cake to buy for different occasions and people.  The decoration of the cakes are very modern with different kinds of style. Love this place, and  I always hope that they can extend their opening hours!
