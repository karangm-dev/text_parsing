This is going to be my first time to write a restaurant review. I had dinner there last night with my friends it was a birthday party. We made reservation at 7pm and we were sat around 7:30pm.I can say this is the most horrible experienced  dining I ever had. As soon as we sat down we order drinks it took forever to come out and some drinks our waitress forgot. We ordered the food one of my friend ordered the apetizer but it came out with her meal. We waited for so long for the food to come out we were really starving and honestly it's not worth to wait for what you are paying. Service was horrible she have no idea what she was doing when the check came she charged us 4 sangria that we didn't get!!! It honestly ruin our plan for that night because we had to spend literally 3 and half hours waiting for the service that it was awful slow. I WILL NEVER EVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE AND I WILL TELL TO ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I KNOW TO BEWARE OF THIS RESTAURANT!!!!HORRIBLE SERVICE, FOOD WASN'T GOOD AT ALL I WISH I CAN GIVE ZERO STAR!
