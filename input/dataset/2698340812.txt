This is Robert Bettinger writing this review.  I like to think that I do a good job.  I appreciate the positive reviews I have received.  The negative review apparently relates to the handling of a citation when I was at 702TRAFFIC.  I was there briefly and other attorneys took over when I had to undergo major surgery that saved my life.  I am thankful for all those who have given me their emotional, spiritual and encouraging support.  I handle misdemeanors and auto cases (since I have a medical background.  Thank you for your ongoing support Las Vegas.Robert Bettinger (Dr. Bob)702 353 1608
