Ok. In all fairness, pharmacy's have allot of variables to deal with, e.g., different insurance plans, sick patients, elderly, etc., so I get that. However, when one pharmacy stands out with poor customer service nearly every visit in comparison to other Walgreens, something needs to be said.The wait times are long, even with 5 or 6 people running around in the pharmacy, they still can't seem to get it right. Last night i called to speak with the pharmacy, i got the front/customer service. They tried to transfer me to the pharmacy, no one picked up after several attempts. I complained to the manager of long hold times, she said they get complaints all tge time and offered to take my contact info to the pharmacy perainally.  I called back, got thru, spoke to a rep and was on hold for over 30 minutes. I drove to the Drive thru, still on hold, and showed the girl i spoke with that i was still on hold, and she looked up at the phone right and front of her and was embarrased.Although the Pharmacist on staff, Marcus, apologized and gave me my medication at no cost ($6), it doesn't make up for the long waits in line, and no one seems to know what the hell they're doing.Made the switch to CVS.
