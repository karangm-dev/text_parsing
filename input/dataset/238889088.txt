This place is the worst! They treat their tenants horribly, they literally watch you every second to the point where the doors to the elevators open as you walk up to them with your floor button already pressed. The fact that they literally watch you every second takes away from being able to truly relax in comfort. The HOA is THE WORST!! Walked our dogs out on a rainy day and was given a formal warning because we walked back in through the front door because we didn't want to walk around the building to go through the back door designated for pets in the pouring rain. However if your car is in the valet they don't mind if you walk your pets through the front, go figure. The pet area stinks so bad! You can smell it from the front walk way, and on really hot days it wreaks even worse. They also have a designated length of what your leash should be.. really who does that!? Spend your money some place else, this place is the worst. Also they say that you can only load stuff through the loading dock which closes at 4, unless they feelLike leaving before 4 in which case you're out of luck. We had an incident the other day trying to load things up to our place and they tried to tell us it was closed at four, "yes I know, and what time is it now"' I said, "345" was the response, to which I replied "exactly". There are tons of great places around here that would gladly take your business without all the bull. Look every where else before committing to this place.
