I don't often go into these types of stores, because they are cluttered and messy.  I was very surprised to see this store was clean and tidy.  I did not end up buying anything, but I did get greeted two times through the store.  I am very particular when it comes to merchandising, because of my retail background....and this store was top notch.  Not too bad for my first Yelp review.  You got me to sign up Dollar Tree! Good job!
