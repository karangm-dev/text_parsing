I'm in the process of canceling this membership.  Price is not worth it.  Just a list of what I know about is currently wrong with bedsBed 4 - 12-14 inch crack where you lay down.  Major safety concern (see photo)Bed 5 - Fan and face bulb control buttons have note not to touch Bed 6 - Fan and face bulb controls is barely attached (this has been for the entity of my membership)The broken areas I spoke about in my last update were broke 4-6 weeks before being repaired.  This is before we get to the disgustingly dirty floors.  There is about 6 inches between the wall and the foot of the bed and a little more then that between the wall and the head of the bed.  These areas are easy to get to with a broom and mop.  I know this because I've done it when I worked at a tanning salon in college.  I was told when I pointed it out today that it was impossible to clean so they didn't do it.All they do is whip down the tanning surface.When I asked to cancel my membership immediately I was told I'd have to call in on Saturday because that is the only time the owner is available.  I asked to leave a message for him to call me and was told and I quote, "You know he has a full time job right?".  Yes - I also have a business which I work a lot more then full time with so I understand.  And personally I'd rather have the number of the unhappy customer so that I can reach out immediately and have the solution handled.  I certainly don't want my staff undervaluing the time of an already unhappy customer.This place is a simple case of you get what you pay for - it's cheap not affordable and not a great value.  I'll be happily paying somewhere else.I am so sorry I let this run so long - I should have gone with my gut an canceled months ago.
