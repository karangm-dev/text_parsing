First, I am very happy with the diagnostic services at this location. The office is beautiful and clean, the diagnostic staff is friendly and helpful and I never have to wait long. I've been using this Sim Med location for all of my imaging needs for several years now. They are good about mailing you results, which is always an appreciated follow-up.Honestly, This would be a 5 star rating if not for the billing staff. They made me pay for my imaging at time of service (unheard of in all of my experience thus far with Simon Med and EVDI) because they felt my annual insurance deductible had not been met. I questioned them since I knew that I had met my deductible, but it didn't matter. I was required to pay, I needed the additional testing on my abnormal scan. Sure enough, my insurance paid, I have a credit balance at Simon Med. The billing staff should issue me an immediate credit to my card, but that has not happened. I'm having to jump through hoops to just get me money back for the over-payment. This is unacceptable way to do business. I still have no credit.
