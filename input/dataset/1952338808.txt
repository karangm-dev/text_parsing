This place blew me away - completely unexpectedly. The music upon entering was on point - so perfect for the venue. The service was friendly and very helpful we loved our waiters!!! The food was delicious - mind blown by the lobster beef dumplings and the fried chicken - oh, and make sure to order the fries they are a standout. Also the most comfortable chairs ever. We will be back for sure!!!!!!!
