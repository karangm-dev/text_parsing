Jimmy's A & A Deli is la creme de la creme, the icing on the cake, and in this case, THE best schawarma and falafel place I have been to in Calgary. Oh, and did I mention that not ONLY is the food taste bud- tantalizing, but the prices are some of the cheapest around?!?!? I'm talkin' 2 people can eat a DISGUSTING amount of food, feel like they've been to heaven and back AT LEAST a couple of times, and want to come back for more for the rest of their lives. And at what cost comes this whole body experience you ask? $15 dollars...for BOTH people. SAY WHAAAAAT?!?!?! Where else in the city can you get a meal bigger than your head for less than $8?!?!? YOU CAN"T. During the winter it's a grab and go kinda place, there's nowhere to sit inside, so you KNOW the service will be fast.  In the summer, the service is just as fast and exceptional and if you're in the mood, you can pull up one of the chairs they set up for their patrons and eat, digest and enjoy the view, all at once. Seriously people: if you haven't tried Jimmy's A & A Deli, you haven't lived a full life. Put it on your bucket list and GET THERE.
