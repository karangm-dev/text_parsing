Seeing "Chicago" in the name of a taco shop gave me a little pause, but the food and employees are both 5 stars. The Asada fries were awesome! The meat was well seasoned and had that perfect grilled crunch that I love. You can choose nacho cheese or cheddar,  I chose the cheddar, and they put a good portion on.  It's topped with Pico,  sour cream   and a huge scoop of fresh guac. Lovely dish!I also had a pastor taco, which is just like a traditional street taco you would find elsewhere.  The pastor was perfectly seasoned and had the same crunch from being grilled. Overall a great experience: Food was great and the staff was very friendly.  The owner came to the table to  ask how the food was and we talked for a few minutes. He was genuinely interested in feedback and his passion for cooking and providing a great experience for his customers was very evident.I recommend everyone stop in and give this place a try.  It is now on my list of regular lunch spots when I am on the N. Side.
