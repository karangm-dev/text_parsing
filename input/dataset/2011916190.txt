Not good. We arrived at 7:40pm on a Saturday night, typically right in the middle of the dinner hour, and half the tables had the chairs put up as they were preparing for closing. I got a #3 combo and two of the three items were cold as well as the rice. My gf's carne asada burrito was cold also, so they remade it, and it still wasn't very hot. No guac was on the burrito, just meat and a little pico. The chips were not good at all, they had a chemical taste. How do you mess up chips???? We will not be returning. I would put this on the same level with Filiberto's. Stick with Ajo Al's for mexican food, at least it's served hot.
