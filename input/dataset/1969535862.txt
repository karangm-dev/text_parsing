My husband and I used Bill Olmstead and his team for the purchase and sale of our first home with the recommendation from a friend. We were incredibly happy with our purchase. As first time homebuyers and moving from out of state we were literally and mentally in new territory. His team walked us through every step of the process and we were able to get something great for our growing family within our budget in such a competitive market.What really stood out was how the sale of our home went. We had already made a few minor upgrades to the property, but when it came time to sell, Bill gave us a few pointers to polish up the place. Using all of his recommended vendors, we were able to accomplish this in a short time and for low cost. He appropriately read the market and priced our home reasonably, and we ended up selling our home within a few days and walked away with an extra $30,000 cash in our pockets.Bill was very streamlined, communicative and thorough through the whole process. We would absolutely use his services again if we move back to Phoenix, and we recommend Bill Olmstead's team with the highest regard!
