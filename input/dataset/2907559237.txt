If you are someone like myself that loves Las Vegas, but doesn't care much for gambling (strange I know), this may be the place for you. This hotel is not on the strip, but within walking distance of the strip or you can take the Monorail across the street. It is a breath of fresh air! Literally, it's a smoke free hotel and might I add quiet. No bells or whistles going off as you enter to retire for the evening. The staff is super friendly; every person I encountered was more than willing to assist. They also offer complimentary breakfast every morning. Very convenient if you are going to the Convention Center, about a block away. I would definitely go back!
