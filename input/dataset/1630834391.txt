My favorite, least-favorite place to be! While it's never a good reason why I'm here (I mean, car issues are never good), these guys ALWAYS make me feel better about my lack of car knowledge and they get my car going again with no hassle. They're honest, nice, and funny, so if you're stuck waiting for your car to be fixed, there's worse places to be.Most importantly, I always know I can count on them to be honest about what's wrong with my Honda and fix it. They define trustworthy service, and it's why I keep coming back!
