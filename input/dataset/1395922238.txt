Took Uber more tahn 10 times and most of the drivers don't want to use GPS guidance and got lost in the city! It took me 45 min from atwater to mile end with NO traffic at all!  They don't know how to drive! They are creepy and impolite! uber quality standard is not the one in San Franciso, NY or Paris! WHY IS THAT???
