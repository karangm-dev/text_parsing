This review is primarily for the Sundance Grill and a little bit for the d√©cor of the Silverton in general. My girlfriend and I went there for lunch and it was a very good experience.Silverton is a few miles south off the main strip in Las Vegas. It has a rustic motif with a huge pro-bass shop. It is not as gaudy as the resorts on the main strip (although we did only visit there for lunch). The interior is carries the theme well and the huge aquarium tank is very impressive with many fish, at least two rays, and a mermaid "water dancer" that performs periodically.The Sundance Grill is located inside the casino and is similar to a classic sit-down-and-order restaurant.  The wait staff was very prompt, courteous, and helpful.  Our food came out in a reasonable time and tasted quite good: we had the French dip sandwich with French fries and the triple decker club sandwich with coleslaw.  The whole meal came out to be $25, which, I felt, was a very good price.I would definitely recommend it to my friends and return both to visit the Silverton and to eat at the Sundance Grill.
