A pleasure to shop here. The staff is friendly, helpful and multilingual. They have a boutique section where I have found Chico's brand items among other recognisable lables. I also found a chic leather Brooks Brothers Purse and a pair of Walking Cradles which are dreamily comfortable shoes on par with Clarks.   The majority of clothes are sorted and sized and there is a small section for housewares and furniture.      Well worth the visit if you are attempting to be a good steward of your resources.
