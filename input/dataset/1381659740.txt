I had a new Escalade that somebody wrecked. I was referred to take it to AW. It took two months to fix with a number of excuses why it was taking so long. I was even told one time it was because of the insurance adjuster, I called the adjuster and it was not true. Now after two months I get a call that is done and I can come pick it up. I leave work and drive across town to pick it up and guess what, it was not even done. They missed the A pillar damage, what? So they will me to come the next day. I get a call the next day and they tell me to wait one more day as they wanted it to be perfect for me. So finally I go get it. There are pieces of garbage in the paint so big I can catch a nail on them. I took it home over the weekend so I could inspect it. I put blue tape on each piece of junk, run, HAIR and sag and there was probably 50 to 60 pieces of tape all over the repairs. Monday morning I called them and asked to talk to the manager. He asked me to meet him Tuesday morning at 8 am. I drive there and he is late so the painter comes out to look at it. I proceed to tell him all the tape all over the truck are flaws in the paint, he proceeds to argue with me over it and saying one of the scratches in the paint is from being washed, I never washed it. Finally the manager shows up and barely says a word but they will take care of it. So again two more days to fix it. HAHA, again they did crappy work. All they did was buff the hell out of it so now the new paint work is glass smooth and all the original factory paint work has its usual orange peel in it. When I pointed it out they stand there saying nothing. That kinda told me they are use to being called out on their poor work. I highly DO NOT recommend them. Take your car to Exotic and get a good job done. This place is a disaster.
