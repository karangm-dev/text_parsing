I understand that Ross is not the run of the mill department store, and that things are not always going to be neat and orderly, but this store takes it to an extreme.  The store always seems to be picked over like a Black Friday sale.  There is no organization or cleanliness evident any time I enter the store.  The only employees I ever see are the cashiers and the people wearing the Loss Prevention vests whose sole purpose seems to be to stop people after they have already paid and search their bags.  All around a pretty awful experience in the store, I would suggest you just move on rather than going in.
