This is my favorite barbecue place in all of Charlotte. I've never dined in before but have ordered this through UberEats countless of times when I need a barbecue craving wolves but just don't want to get out my room. The barbecue is just PHENOMENAL, along with their sides, it's just really tough to beat. Their cornbread is the right consistency of fluffy that I could just eat hella of it in one sitting. Their potato salad is always good but I've only had better at my husband's cookouts when they decide to pull out the homemade batch. Their baked beans are also an awesome side for barbecue and I don't know, I'm just so in love with this place regarding comfort food. Do not sleep on this place y'all.
