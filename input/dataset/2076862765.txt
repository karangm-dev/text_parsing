Prior to boarding my dogs there I went to check out the facilities and ask question? They showed me around the place was very clean and they were very polite and all smiles. So, I booked the reservations, brought my two dogs and continued. I was gone for three days, called them twice a day to check in my girls. Then the same girl I spoke to was very robotic but told me yes, they were fine. So, come Sunday morning when they opened I went to collect my dogs. They looked depressed. I felt horrible! Then as I was walking out with ther belongings I noticed the whole bag of food was only used once. So, what were my girls eating? Come three days later and they both have kennel cough. My dogs are very healthy. Never again...
