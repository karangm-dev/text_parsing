I have two children taking violin lessons with Cantabile and I couldn't be happier with how their teacher has fostered a love for their instrument in particular, and music in general.  My children enjoy playing their violins and truly look forward to their lessons every week, something they never felt when they were previously enrolled in another music school.If you are looking for music teachers for your children, look no further!  You and your children will enjoy the learning experience with the teachers at Cantabile!  They are excellent!
