I grew up in Las Vegas and have heard about this place for many years. My brother is a huge fan. We had so much hope and expectations. There was an hour wait but it was Saturday so that's expected and we anticipated the food being great so we stuck it out. We were really really disappointed.Pros: Old school style, big portions, very cool (but busy/tacky) decor, real mob family type motif which was cool. Menu was on the wall and very simple, which is convenient.Cons: Food. We didn't have a single good dish. Mozz sticks were not hot, and the outside crust was "homemade" but tasted like stale cardboard. The salads were Hurricane Katrina flooded with dressing, I like dressing, but dang the lettuce was floating! The free wine was very watered down, but what do you expect for free? We had Lasagna, one of my favorite dishes at every Italian restaurant, and Ravioli. The sauce is absolutely gross; It tasted like canned tomato paste, and not even the good kind. The sauce was so bad, I only ate about 1/4 of the Lasagna and that was a struggle. The raviolis weren't bad if you scraped off all the tomato paste. A good sauce is like one of the main guarantees you can expect at a good Italian place. For the sauce to be THAT bad, it was just utterly shocking.We will not be eating here again or giving them another chance. Unless they come out with some sort of press release saying they've completely overhauled their sauce recipe.
