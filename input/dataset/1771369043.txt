I have to say that the gelatos offered are amazing. Best in town!!! I can't get enough of the Lemon Mint. I was sad to see they removed it. But they have other really good options. I have to say that every time I go I have to acknowledge Gabriella and Max. They are by far the best and most amazing employees. The lady that works in the week has no idea what she is doing. Please have Gabriella and/or Max work during the week. They are so patient, kind and extremely hard working.
