I would recommend checking out the Lucky Moose Food Mart, located at 393 Dundas St W, Toronto, ON M5T 1G6 for produce. Can't beat the sales. My favorite items include Ontario sweet potato and bushels of kale. Perfect for someone who is looking for health-conscious food items on a budget. Pay in cash and support local grocers.
