This is an update on the review I posted for TRANQUILITY PONDS. I gave them a glowing report because at the time my pond was operating efficiently but after having it cleaned nine months after construction the water has never been clear and it's getting worse every day. I was told I was supposed to put chemicals into the water every week which is nonsense.  The water is very cloudy very murky and doesn't look like the filter is handling the job anymore. Something is very wrong and when I call the company all I get  it is a runaround. They want to charge me $149 to come out just to look at it. I have a $3500 sewer right now and no one seems to want to do anything about it except tell me to put chemicals in it.  And I question Holly the owner about it and reminded her that I have been putting chemicals and as per her suggestion and the pond is getting worse she hung up on me. How can you hang up on a customer who spent $3500 less than a year earlier for a pond that was badly constructed,   I now discover and cheaply made.?  Their rating on Angie's list is extremely poor. Wish I had seen this sooner.  I have several koi fish and turtles that are suffering because the filter has not worked properly in several weeks.Their customer service after the pond is built is extremely poor also. I would NOT recommend this company to anyone now. I intend to have this pond reconstructed the right way by people who actually care.
