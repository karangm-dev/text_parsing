I always receive excellent customer service from this branch of Enterprise. The current staff are professional and courteous, and often go "above and beyond".  While we are just outside of their catchment area (so, sadly, they won't pick us up), we still rent from this location because of their lower prices and excellent service. Definitely recommended.
