Such a pleasant experience! The technician was gentle with me since pain is a major part of daily life for me. I really enjoyed the foot and lower leg massage; plus my toes look super cute! My friend wanted penguins, so they brought over a tech that must specialize in freehand art, because her winter penguins are so adorable and fun! The salon itself has a nice atmosphere. There is not a strong chemical smell, the selection of polishes is quite large, and it is beautifully decorated. The massage chairs look fairly new and are quite comfortable.They do take credit cards for payment, but be prepared to have cash for the tip.
