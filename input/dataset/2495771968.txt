I've used Ed a couple of times for home inspections. He is very thorough in his inspections, and provides a complete, detailed report AND a summary. He will complete his inspection on his own, then walk you - the buyer - thru every room and item so you know exactly what you might be buying. I have found him and Terri to be professional and reliable and will use Clearview for any home I might buy.
