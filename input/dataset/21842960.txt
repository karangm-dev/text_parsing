You know, I get it--the cheesecake here is really really good.  But everything about this place is really really bad.  First, I cannot get over the fact that this place tries to pass itself off as fancy (valet parking, for example) when it is a) called "The Cheesecake Factory" and b) ATTACHED TO A MALL--arguably two of the least fancy things imaginable.  The inside of this place is basically a glorified cafeteria--just a loud din of noise, which makes it even crazier that people dress up to go here. The food itself (even that which is not cheesecake related) is incredibly caloric and fattening.  I spent most of my life trying to avoid this place, and, I realized today, for good reason--this place is just thoughtless excess at its finest.
