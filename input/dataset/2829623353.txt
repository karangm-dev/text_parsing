I just had dinner at Chris's new restaurant. I was not impressed. I have been dinning at His other restaurants for years and was underwhelmed by the Italian Restaurant. We were disapointed that the servings were really small but good. We had the spagheti pomodoro. We were also very disappointed that the chocolate cake they serve was the same as they serve at Pan Bianco and it was three dollars more. The service was ok but did not care too much for the hostess. She was some what unpolished. I did not care too much for the communal table, it reminded me of Chipotle grill. the atmosphere was noisey and echoed a lot. I will probably try the Italian restaurant again.
