Had a shirt that I purchased for someone as a gift. Turns out, the shirt didn't fit.  He loved it and wanted a different size. I misplaced the receipt and the tags were removed.  However, I did have the card that I purchased this item on.  Without discussion, she immediately told me she would be unable to exchange the item.  I again explained that I only wanted to swap sizes, but the cashier would not budge from her word.  This is so disappointing.  On that day my husband had planned to do additional shopping, but after this we left.  This is the second time they have been difficult to deal with on an exchange.  They lost an additional sale that day and possible future business from us.  It is pretty sad to say, but next time instead of shopping this local establishment, we will reconsider and may go to a big box store that has been more than cooperative with exchanges.
