I highly do not recommend coming here due to the fact that my hair was not done the way I asked for and I was left with two large highlights in the front and my natural dark color in the back. I was so angry that after she was done I had to leave. I then came back because she needed to fix it and while she was fixing it she was being rude and telling me how I told her the wrong thing even though I showed her pictures of how I always got my hair done. I now have to go somewhere else to get it done professionally to fix what she did wrong. Bad service and I will not be coming back
