If you're a local car renter, DONOT BOOK A RENTAL CAR from ACE RENTAL unless you brought with you two copies of your utility bills - yes, you read my comment right!!! I have always rented cars from other local car rental companies in MCCarran Int'l airport but never was I asked to show my utility bills.  Also, pls note that they will REQUIRE you to get the basic car coverage even though you told them that you carry a great coverage so that certainly will add to their "low" price rental -  so don't be fooled like me thinking that you got a cheap rental!!! Will definitely NOT RECOMMEND this place unless you want to experience the same aggravation I did!!!! It's true you get what you paid for... I don't think they like the local renters!!!
