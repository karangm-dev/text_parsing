Went here for lunch. It's one of the few places in Toronto that serve sushi a la cart instead of AYCE. That being said and factoring in the quality of sushi in Toronto, this place barely met my expectations.I had a Chirashi bowl, some salmon sashimi and some tuna maki. The plating was a bit lacking, as it was just simply sushi on a white glass plate. In general, the fish was as I expected it to be for sushi in Toronto; not that fresh, and hence lacking flavour. On top of that, the sashimi I had was not well sliced; I found a couple of bones and what looked like a scale in my sashimi, which was a bit disappointing. The rice was satisfactory as well; I felt like there wasn't enough vinegar in the rice to complement the fish.Overall, it was an average meal. It was convenient and fairly inexpensive, but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to go to this place for sushi alone. (There's also teppanyaki, which I'd try if I were to return for another meal.)
