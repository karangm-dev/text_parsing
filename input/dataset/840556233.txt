MY NEW VET!This place really cares about your pet. I have lived in the west valley most of my life and have never found a vet I liked until now. I have always dreaded a trip to the vet because their main  interest was to see how much money they could get me to spend. On 2 different occasions I have spent $1000+ and ended up losing my pet the same day. At Camelwest, they fit us into their busy schedule the day before a holiday weekend. The vet had nothing but compassion  for our super scared kitty with a urinary tract problem. She clearly wanted what was best our Lucy. The prices were extremely reasonable - less than half of what I was quoted 2 weeks prior when I had her at another vet (that didn't take care of the problem). There are several vets closer to my house but I will gladly drive right past them to get to Camelwest!
