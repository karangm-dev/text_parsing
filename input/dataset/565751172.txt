We attempted to have a nice dinner at Chao. We walked in and did notice that it looked like they weren't quite set up all the way, but decided to still give them a chance. Someone came by and brought two waters with some very melted ice, and he offered no straws. Then the man who sat us at the table came by and took our drink order. We asked for hot tea but again no sweetener was offered. Fifteen minutes later we were still sitting there with people walking around looking busy. We saw two other tables who got there after we arrived get their orders in. We finally decided to get up and leave 20 minutes later. My husband went over to "the server" and gave him $10.00 for the teas. The server didn't apologize for never coming back around to take our dinner orders he just took the money and said nothing. We walked over to BLD and had a wonderful dinner. We won't be back to Chao!
