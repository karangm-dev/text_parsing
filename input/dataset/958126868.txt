Azzip Pizza is literally SO good. I have been there so many times and each time I get a "Big Zip" for $8.22. The place is amazing and the pizza cooks in about 2 minutes. It is the build your own concept and I have never had a bad experience there. Also, I go there about 4 times a week.. Don't worry I hit the gym, sometimes..
