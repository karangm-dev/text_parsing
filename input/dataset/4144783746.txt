the absolute worst experience, and even worst staff!!!! I tried to check in early, and was very rudely told nothing was available it was to early.  Which I could understand.  But what happened next really blew my mind. I was called on my cell, which I had put down when I reserved the room,( which the first day was charge at the time of making the reservation). And told that no rooms would be available.  Even though I had made the reservation and paid the required deposit over a month in advance.  I drove there to speak to a manager,  and was told by the front desk girl.  That she was the manager, but I really don't think so.  I was told that all deposits would be refunded, but it woulld take sometime.  And that again no rooms were available. They offered me a room at another emerald suite miles away on las vegas blvd.  which they had absolutely nothing to do with, nor could my deposit ge used there.  Simply ludicrous.   Bottom line is was stuck in Las Vegas without a room.  I ended up renting a room at a hotel that ended up costing my almost 4 X tines what I thought I would be paying.   Anyone one and everyone who reads this don't ruin your trip to Las Vegas by booking a room at emerald suites Cameron.
