I was just in this bar last night for a friends birthday, I rarely go out so I was really looking to have a good time. Unfortunately I had a guy call me a pretty disrespectful and demeaning name, which sparked an issue between this guy and I. This guy weighed about 150 pounds more than I did and towered over me, during our shouting match security did nothing while he sat there and threatened me and watched him get closer and closer to my face suggesting violence any time during this situation. I am sick to think that they didnt want to step in, instead, my boyfriend did and WE got thrown out of the bar. Not only that, the police got involved and security did not make any type of statement about the situation making it a "he said, she said" bar argument. I am livid!!!! If you ever need any type of security in a situation like this, Saddle Ranch is staffed with a bunch of useless security. Not only am I ticked about this, I was also irritated through out the night at how RUDE the staff was. Some guys walking around in bright shirts that said HOST on the back were very pushy all night, I know the place is crowded but nobody ever said excuse me to get through, I was told to "get out of the way". I have never been here during the day, maybe its different, I dont know, but my experience here was absolutely horrible and I am very embarrassed for the dim-wit security here, and I feel extremely disrespected.
