Brought my 2005 Prius in for routine maintenance once again, and I'm writing another review about Right Toyota's outstanding service department! Year after year, I have received quality care and personal service from Assistant Service Manager, Bob Marthaler. A positive reflection about a company is when they have longevity with their staff. Bob always takes care of me, which is why I keep going back!
