Service is always great but the quality has been poor both times I have been. It's disappointing because the reviews on here are so good. But each time the rolls have been missing ingredients and I had to go back. The second visit had the roll actually falling apart because it was so poorly made. I'm very reluctant to give it a 3rd chance but there aren't too many great sushi places downtown...
