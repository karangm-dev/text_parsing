Thank you so much for towing my car today!! I woke up to a flat tire this morning and, sadly, I don't know how to change it to a spare tire.... :(   Other towing companies charge so much, and I didn't want to pay fortune to tow just 1.5 miles.  This company charge only the actual distance from the location of the car to the destination.  Not like other companies which told me from their location to the destination.  Living in the Summerlin area, there aren't many towing companies around here.  The drivers were very courteous and professional.  Highly recommend this place!!
