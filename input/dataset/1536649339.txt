Every time I call to refill the Rx I have had for 6 years, it takes forever.  Last time it took 3 hours and multiple phone calls to different numbers before it finally went through.  Today I was disconnected TWICE, 15 minutes in to each call.  I'm not sure if they are using an archaic system or what.  There's got to be a better option!
