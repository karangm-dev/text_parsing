This place impressed me a lot. I went here both nights I was in town on business. The first night I just visited the bar and had a wine 'flight.' The bartender was pretty cool. I took a look at the menu and knew I had to come for dinner.I came the next night for dinner. The dinner didn't disappoint! First off, the bread was really good. So that's a good sign. I ordered a starter, a soup, an entree and shared a dessert.Starter: We started off with the stuffed mushrooms. They were really tasty.Soup: Next I tried the Onion soup. OMG. To this day, this is my favorite Onion soup in the world. I have French Onion soup anytime i see it on the menu. It's one of the few things I'm still craving food wise in the past couple of years. The broth was made of Guinness and I can't tell you how good it was. Mmmmm.Entree: Apple Amaretto Chicken. This was also really good. I can see why it's a favorite!Dessert: Amaretto Creme Brule. I really liked it, but my friend thought the sugar on top was a bit too thick.Overall: The service was top notch and the food was really tasty. I also really liked the atmosphere. Best of all, the prices were really reasonable. I would totally go back in a heartbeat.
