My 20 minute wait turned in to 2 hours and just before I was called back I saw a small note saying the provider was not a medical doctor, but a Physician's Assistant. At one point I asked if they had a room where I could go lie down (so I wouldn't fall down). I was told no, they had to keep rooms open for emergencies. So wait, my dizzy and feel like passing out isn't emergent enough? Sheesh. A 2-hour wait with a mere 4 patients in the waiting room is ridiculous. If I hadn't felt so yucky I would have left. Unless they make some changes, I recommend finding another urgent care.
