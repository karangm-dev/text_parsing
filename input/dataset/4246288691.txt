I'm not the biggest fan of buffet. I find them kind of gross normally. Cravings was pretty good with a very large selection of food. We went for brunch, so all you can eat plus unlimited champagne or mimosas for $25 is pretty damn good. Our waitress was very attentive and accommodating. I would have given this place 3 stars if it hadn't been for the hostesses / cashiers at the front. We were a group of 12, but were just going to meet inside. Paid for our meals, went to be seated, and asked for a large table since we were a group. Mind you the place was empty given it was around 11am .... told no flat out. Then told we would have to pay extra for a group ... aren't you a buffet in a casino? And shouldn't you cater to groups? We noticed they were giving an elderly group of people the same treatment. Luckily our waitress just moved us and we were all able to sit together. Personally, I don't care about the extra $3 or $5 bucks, it was just the attitude of the hostess was completely out of line.
