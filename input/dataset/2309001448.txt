I must admit I only ate here once during a connection flight from Atlanta back home to Sacramento CA. I had a chicken teriyaki bowl and the chicken was over cooked and did not taste good at all. Also, for $11 I would think they would at least give you a bit more rice. I would recommend you try any of the many other food sources at this airport. By the way I am a level 6 reviewer on TripAdvisor (RevfromCA) with 180 reviews including 75 restaurant reviews in many different cities. I provide honest objective reviews both positive and negative.
