When you first start here they make the kids feel special. But, DONT SIGN THE CONTRACT ITS A TRAP. My son loved it the first few months everyone was nice. We moved I canceled our membership I had to pay 2-3 months worth of membership before they would let me cancel. Unless you know 100% you kid will go religiously don't make my mistake and sign that contract.
