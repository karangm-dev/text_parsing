DIS-GUS-TING!!!!!! Omg everything was awful, three of us went for drinks and appies. Just plain horrible. Tacos... grose, chicken tacos.... Grose and super spicy, red wine sangria..... Better off throwing up in my mouth. Waitress seemed bothered and slow, mind you she was pregnant. Needless to say will never return.
