I chose Troy's after getting bids from 5 companies.  Very good price for the job, plus a senior discount.  His crew showed up on time on the day promised and did a great job removing 3 good sized, volunteer palm trees that were causing problems to my block fence.  They ground all the stumps carefully, avoiding underground irrigation pipes and covering windows to prevent damage.  They cleaned up all the debris, and everything looked great when they were done. I wholeheartedly recommend Troy's Tree Service.
