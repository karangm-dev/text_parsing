We dropped our 1997 expedition off to have the transmission replaced.  I had already changed the filter and gasket transmission needed to be replaced.  They returned it a week later we made it less than 25 miles before the transmission went out completely I climbed under to find the exact same transmission in the truck.  The torque converter and Trans are still original.  Truck is now stranded in the middle of the road.  Oh did I mention they charged 2005 dollars for this service. Update- they refused to acknowledge they put the wrong transmission in the truck.  Verified with United transmissions that the wrong one was installed.  George was unwilling to warranty work that wasn't completed.  Horrible service.  Will make it my mission to get this company closed down and removed from dmv.  Also refused refund and it has been less that 16 hours.
