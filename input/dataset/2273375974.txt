I attended a meeting in this property's first floor space, the Inspiration Ballroom.  The complimentary coffee and ice water were appreciated. But, the noisy air handling system was a huge distraction. The constant background humming was punctuated by loud vibrations every minute or two, ruining the ambiance and suitability for business meetings.On the plus side, parking is far more convenient than any of the Downtown hotels.
