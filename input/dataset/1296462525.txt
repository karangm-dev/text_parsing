WOW - this place is incredible.  It is huge, well lit, organized and everything is used and reasonably priced.  Saw this place on Yelp and had to check it out.  They advertise as an entertainment exchange store.  They take trades on books, magazines, movies, CDs, games......   I have never seen a used place this well, great.  Wish we had something comparable in Denver.
