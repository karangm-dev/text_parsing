This place is awesome!I came here with customers and coworkers who say they eat at Sushisamba whenever in Vegas. After dining here I fully understand this. First good point: a great selection of whiskeys including two of my favorites Hibiki and Yamazaki by Suntory. Not only that, they offer the aged versions. Now, I wasn't going to waste good Japanese whiskeys on unsuspecting Amerika-jin so Infirst ordered a miles blend that is less than $20 glass. Everyone loved that soninordered the 17y Hibiki ($60/glass) for the group sample. Oh my!One of my sales guys did the ordering so I can't swear to the names of the dishes we sampled. Some pictures are posted but if you look you will see that there are over 2000 photos posted at this restaurant!  All the sushi and sashimi are not traditional. They come with sauces and toppings that give an appealing edge to the fishes. The staff is 1st class. I smoke with the manager several times. 1st I wanted to know how he gets Suntory whiskeys that I can't find in Houston anywhere. He said that this comes from his distributor but that he was already past his allocation for the year. Hmm, I would ship a case home on my next trip to Japan if not for the fear of my wife kicking my butty for spending $1000s on whisky. Oh I digress. Biiru o nomimasu ka?  This restaurant has a full selection of craft beers from Japan. Even a rice beer for those with gluten allergies that I need to find for my wife. Desserts looked great but we were so stuffed and full of drinks that we all passed. A very fun night with great food and drinks.
