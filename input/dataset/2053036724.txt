I'm so sad...out favorite Chinese restaurant in the valley has closed. :( We drove all the way from Goodyear to eat dinner and when we arrived we found Tott's closed with only a sign that said "closed relocating". We almost started crying as we dream about Tott's and look forward to making the trek across town for their terrific food.I sure hope they open back up (maybe in Goodyear???). :)
