The only thing I found interesting about the place was the self tap tables which I didn't sit at. The service was horrible, my Bloody Mary was disgusting, and the place was a sausage fest ( too many guys). Also I was extremely disappointed by the small dance floor. I knew Dierks Bently was a sellout when they opened their bar in old town Scottsdale. This place is not true to country roots at all.
