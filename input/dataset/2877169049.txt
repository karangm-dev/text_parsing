This is the response I get after my review. 1 it's doesn't take 2 hours to get someone suits they have ordered. I clearly stated they came that day cause guys were in from out of town.  Your excuses are bullshit. For the unsatisfactory service. I have no need to call you. I was in there already and expressed my opinion of the company and how horrible service was and all I was told was sorry. My fiance talked to someone there and came in and was told the same thing. You need  a better system of doing things. A 2hour wait for someone to even bring out suits already paid for yo try on is unsatisfactory. My brother in law was there hours prior and waited so long he had to leave also. And you gave him the wrong suits. No other place to rent a suits from needs so many adj. And to actually have to check for stains. What are the people who wash the suits doing. There where stains on everyone's. .. my husband was in a wedding 2 weeks prior with a rental suit ordered on line. Fit perfect. No adj. Needed and your stuff looks so worn over and stitched so many times.. save your breath from any other comments..
