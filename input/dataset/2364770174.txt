Went here a long time ago remembered it was pretty good, went tonight and literally got turned away. we got there at 8:40, they close at 9:00 but there were four tables still in various stages of eating.  I know it sucks to show up in the last 30 min but there were people obviously without food yet. No one came out to greet us for 10 min. A kid with long hair comes out and refuses to seat us stating they closed in five minutes.  I asked about all the people seated without food, he said it didn't matter, no apology or further explanation. Not that I want to eat somewhere that is so unwelcoming and rude. Beware, they actually close at 8:30pm.
