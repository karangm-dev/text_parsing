I was so excited to see this Outback was now open for lunch.  I cannot get enough of Outbacks salad.  Not that it is anything spectacular by any means.  It's just usually fresh and well chilled.  Service is soSLOWLike seriously slow... The first time I came I chopped it up to being newly opened for lunch and still figuring out staffing but nope!  I've been here 3 times and it sucks.  I order the endless soup and salad with barely enough time to eat even the salad.-love soupless in Phoenix
