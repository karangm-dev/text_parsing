I was traveling for work so I asked my wife to make an appointment to get my Vanden Plas looked at. She tried to make an appointment but since she didn't know the exact model of the car, she was dismissed and was told just show up after 730 when they open. I drove 35 minutes down to show up after 730 and was told I had to make an appointment. I explained that my wife was not treated the best on the phone and I can only assume it was the guy in the office by his attitude.  It is not cheap to fix these cars, I will gladly take my money elsewhere. The only thing the woman could say was we must've called the wrong place. Apparently they don't know how yelp and the Internet works when the phone number is linked and you state the name of your business when you answer the phone.
