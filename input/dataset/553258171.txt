I have nothing but good things to say about Jason "Ridiculous" Andrada. I've been doing the sport just as long as he has or maybe around the same time frame. But, he has definitely more competition experience than me. I've seen him fight live at least twice and he is an exciting, good, and a technical fighter.   Anyways, I was in Vegas for a few days and wanted to train Muay Thai somewhere. Dropped in for a day (wish I went everyday when I was there), and his class is very technical, focusing more on technique than cardio. I learned a lot in one day and look forward to coming back next time I'm in Vegas. Highly recommended.
