I went here after speaking with Frank and he seemed to be very accommodating with helping to put on my snow tires. I get to the shop gave him my tires, and get a call saying one of them is completely flat. I had personally put them in my car that morning and all were perfectly fine as they were bought the previous winter. He says I need to purchase a new tire so without another choice I agreed saying it will be about $100 (I said I didn't care for a brand new one). Go to pay for service, after not being happy about paying for a new tire which was not flat and total came up to $430-for an oil change, 2nd hand tire, and putting on my snow tires which were on rims. The new tire costed over $200. Four days later that "new tire" I had just bought went flat. Such a waste of money, will not be back.
