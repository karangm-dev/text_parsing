I was excited about eating here. We stopped in for the late night menu. We had the BBQ wings and order of fries... We wings where good despite the fact they didn't come with the crispy fried onions... The service was AWFUL.. I wanted a drink not once were we asked if we wanted anything other than water.. The fries I asked for wasn't waffle and the waiter Christoper tried to be rude by showing me a shoe string fry. Every time I tried to ask for a drink he act as if he didn't hear and the one time he did check on us . He left before I could say anything... Very Dissappointed
