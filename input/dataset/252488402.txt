Kimberly A. is noted as the cashier on my receipt. Just an over all awful service. I watched her give someone a bag and did not offer to help the lady with her four orders. When I ordered, she did not say anything after the transaction was done, so I initiated by saying thank you very much and she did not respond. When we got our pizza she just said my name and left the counter. Looked like she didn't want to be there and all of the customers waiting for their food were able to tell which made it even more uncomfortable.
