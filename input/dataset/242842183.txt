I stumbled upon Lisa's instagram a couple years ago and booked my first session with her in December of 2015. My first session with her was in her at-home salon and let me tell you - she was humble and kind then, and she is still humble and kind now. Her hard work and passion really shows. You aren't JUST a client to her, you're more than that. I've had my hair done by Lisa, Olivia, and my previous 2 sessions have been with Jess. They all really value their clients and put in 110%. They take their time with you and are very honest with you (ex: number of sessions it may take to achieve your desired colour). It might take a couple hours to get your hair done but you truly get what you pay for (bring your laptop, theres free wifi). It's amazing looking at the progress Lisa has made with her studio, what started off with just her has now grown into a small team of talented hairstylists! I'm gonna be getting my hair done by them even when i'm an old lady with grey hairs and a walking stick :)
