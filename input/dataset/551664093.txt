Absolute rip off.  Brought in 30 almost new CD's, many of which I could not find in Zia's store selection the day I went in and most were named artists (Pink, Daughtry, Nickelback, Jimmy Buffet...etc.)  Offered me .75 cents (on average) per CD, yet were selling the same items for 10 to 15 times the amount offered me.  I could get better (and will) donating the items to charity and taking the tax write off.  30 lightly used CD's and Zia's offered me $12 cash or $18 credit (for every 30 used CD's, I could almost buy 2 used CD's from Zia's).  Turned me off as a buyer thinking how badly Zia's exploited the seller or how badly I was getting doused as a buyer....knowing what kind of money they were paying sellers for the used CD's.  Furthermore, Zia's refused to even look at my CD's to give me a value on the CD's, unless I provided my personal information for their "Zia's Card".  Despite the dyed hair, ink and piercings donned by their employees.....don't be fooled, Zia's is a COMPLETELY COMMERCIAL BUSINESS working under the worst capitalistic model.  BIG THUMBS DOWN!!!
