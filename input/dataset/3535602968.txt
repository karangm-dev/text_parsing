Oh my delish!Adrift a dream of savory, yummy goodness I found Lumiere in all its wonderful glory... Except it was reality, and everything was perfection. From the sweet, welcoming hospitality at the door, to our beloved waiter, James, I felt at home in a classy, yet simple environment filled with joy. I didn't think it was possible to find a restaurant that could compete with my #1 favorite in Charlotte, but dreams absolutely come true for those who wait. A pinch of drama for you there, but Lumiere was sincerely everything I hoped it could be and more. James recommended every single dish that we ate and I do not have a single complaint about anything! For example, we wanted a Malbec, but were still debating. James, of course, brings the bottle to our table, informing us that it is the last bottle and wants to ensure that we would get it if we want it. How adorable! For the appetizers, we went with the foie gras, quail on toast and oysters (per James' recommendations). Savory complements of sweet meets salty meets everything yielded awesomeness. Entrees were a sous vide duck and a steak/short rib that were cooked to tender perfection. We finished up Dessert with a rhum cake, which James literally poured fire over, and a divine creme brulee coupled with a delicious ice cream scoop. For my birthday, I wish James and Lumiere's main chef to be within my touching distance at all times. That is all. Yes to Lumiere, yes to flamingo desserts and yes to all that makes Lumiere what it is!
