Absolutely piss poor job. The VIP wash was anything but... water spots on my mirrors, dirt and dust all over the inside like it was never touched. For 15+ bucks you should be ashamed of your business and your staff, who is in too much of a hurry to get off the clock that they can't even do their job right.
