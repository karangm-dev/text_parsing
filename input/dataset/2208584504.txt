Not a good experience at all. Ended up getting food poisoning on my first time going to this Denny's restaurant. I ordered one of their skillet breakfasts and apparently the food was bad. Right away I had a upset stomach and cramps really bad. I tried not throw up but couldn't hold it down any longer and it came up. Then the Diarrhea came and lasted for two and a half days. There was pork in my meal that had to be bad. You never want to get sick on pork, it's the worse! Then when I was feeling better and not sick I went back and talked to the manager and told her about my bad experience with their food and she told me I should of gone to the hospital and didn't even offer to reimburse me for my meal. She just had a matter fact attitude about it and walked away. No sorry or anything. Just you should of gone to the hospital so we could track the issue but other that we can't help you. . Unbelievable. Please don't go there if you value you life. I can't even give this a one star, It's a ZERO STAR.
