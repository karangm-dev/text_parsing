DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL TO ANYONE. Stayed there for 2 nights and it was the worst two nights of my life. When we got there the man at the front desk was very rude and was on a personal phone call while he was helping me.  When I asked for directions to my room he said "its somewhere on the second floor somewhere." The room was actually nice but the beds were very small. Lucky we were only one to a bed.  The first night we witnessed people stealing from cars and people fighting in the parking lot. When we called the front desk they did not seem to think this was a problem. We called the police but by the time they got the the car thief's were gone. The second day when we were walking to the car there were broken pipes and needles all over the parking lot. (no exaggeration ). The second night was even worse.  There was a domestic violence fight in the back, more car thieves, the room above us the people were jumping on the floor so much we though the ceiling was going to cave in and the front desk, once again, was no help at all. The area around the hotel is very nice its just the hotel itself that is a mess. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone no matter what the price is.
