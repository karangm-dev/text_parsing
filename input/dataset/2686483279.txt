I LOVE this store! Yet again on one of my lunch time travels I stumbled upon Used. Opening my horizons recently to vintage stores, I was surprised to find such a modern store with an extremely helpful employee :) On the plus there was no "used" stench in store. The stores selection of goods was impressive in the fact that all the pieces were unique and affordable (either used or the few new pieces). Unlike Geraldine's experience I found the prices to be on the reasonable side. I purchased a vintage silk dress for $19 that looks exactly like a Hermes scarf pattern. Awesome! P.s. Talk about helpful staff, the dress I bought had 12 buttons running down the back. Unfortunately, one button as missing. The sales lady not only helped me look through a button box she had at the store, but after a failed attempt she recommended me to a store about a block down the street. I went to the store and another helpful employee helped me find the EXACT button for only $0.65!Can't wait to go back when more stuff is in!!
