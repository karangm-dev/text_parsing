The fact that there are three restaurants under one roof is genius.  This place does some awesome fresh poke.  The Island plate counter has loco moco and other hawaiian goodies, and to the right there is a sushi restaurant that was popping.  Soooo Many options!I want it all and then some.  It was almost like a festive potluck once we brought all the food together on the table.  Speaking of which this would be awesome to pick up stuff to make a picnic :)Why are there no good hawaiian places in LA?I want the whole combo of roasted pork loco moco and fresh poke...Soo good...If yall are going, bring me back some ya here.
