I was attending a birthday party at Jackrabbit in Scottsdale and we pulled in nearby, just off Drinkwater Blvd. We saw a valet service and decided to pay the $6 to have them park our car. The valet guy told us to come back no later then 2:15 AM, if we wanted to leave our keys. So I told my husband that's fine I don't want to stay long. We got back to the valet area at 2:08 AM. to notice NO valet guy there and quite a bit of other people walking around wondering how to get their keys. One girl said she arrived at 1:30 AM. and she was told by a note on her car to get her keys at the nearby club. She spoke to someone at the club, and  they had no idea what she was talking about. We noticed the same note on our car. So I eventually found a lady kind enough  AGAIN to go check on our keys and she finally found someone who knew about our keys. What kind of $6  valet parking is that? They DON'T follow through to return our car to us? Many of us were there in time as he asked. Instead they frightened many people because not everyone was informed properly at the club that the keys were left there.....very shady and fishy because if we didn't find someone who finally spoke up about the keys, were they planning on stealing the cars or something? the note also said if keys were not picked up that there would be a FEE to get them back, and we would have to go to Saddle Ranch to get them. What's up with that? Maybe that was the scheme all along....to get more money?? Not very good business skills if you ask me, especially since many of us were there in time! worse valet I have ever experienced! I feel bad for the girl that waited over an hour to finally get her keys after waiting outside in the cold.
