0 stars. Not being from Toronto, I enquired with the locals as to where I could find a nice pub. Imperial Pub came highly recommended. Didn't try the food, but I am never coming back here, and I am actually recommending others don't either. Owner/manager is quite an asshole. I actually witnessed him lunge at and physically assault a young woman outside the pub this week. WTF? Thanks for the recommendation, Toronto. Many other places nearby without the violence.
