Now I see why they are rated so low!!!Can't believe this. Made an a pickup request Saturday. Was told after 9am on Monday Called about 11:00 and was told..."Oh, we pick up between 9-5. Called again at 3:30 and was told, "We only pick up in your area between 3-5" Would have been nice to have gotten this information up front so I could have kept my other appointment or rescheduled them....like Fed Ex a lot better!!! So if you do go with them as for a firm time...and good luck!!!
