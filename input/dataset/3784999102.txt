Hands down the best BBQ I've ever had. Great customer service. Line was up to an hour and a half long but definitely didn't feel that long. They had mist fans on and free waters along with free samples of their smoked jalape√±o sausage. I ordered the brisket and turkey. Best food I've ever had. The plate came with ranch styled baked beans and a piece of bread. Highly recommended giving this place a try but make sure to check their hours because they are weird.
