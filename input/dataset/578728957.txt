Amazing.  I won't even bother going into detail because you either love the Beatles and love this show, or you don't.  The reviews that pick it apart and criticize it, I just don't understand.I was literally brought to tears (okay, I'm super sensitive) by the awesomeness when the show began and it had me entertained the entire time.Tip: Unless you find a legitimately better deal, I recommend purchasing your tickets directly from the Mirage, where the show is performed.  They are trustworthy and they offer AAA and AARP discounts.  DO NOT buy your tickets from any of those "half-priced" ticket booths.  They are shameless salespeople who will tell you that they have the best prices, when they quite simply do not.  Call the Mirage directly and see for yourself who has the better price.
