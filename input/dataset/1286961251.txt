Customer service was horrible. I spent an hour looking for what I needed without being asked if I needed help once. They weren't busy so I'm not sure what the problem was, looked like a lot of talking between employees every time I wanted t ask for help. Then while checking out the lady never said anything nice to me, no hi, just asked if I wanted to signup for there reward program thing. No thank you or anything. Not a good experience at all. Sucks because they have things I need and it's close to me.
