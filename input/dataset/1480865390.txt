Looking for a place to have lunch on Saturday and everything was packed.  We pulled in here and although this looks like and is more of a bar than a restaurant the food was sooooo good! I had the philly cheese steak and my mom had the shrimp Po boy.  The philly had lots of onions and peppers and a queso cheese which gave moisture to the whole sandwich and made it great.  The fries were fresh and soooo good.  Usually fries are just a mediocre afterthought but these were medium sized, spicy, and crisp. Great service.  I would like to go back for more of a night time bar visit.  They had a whole menu of cool shots to order.
