After extensive research on the different types of mattresses to buy, I decide that natural latex was the only way to go.  Since natural latex is typically more costly than other alternatives (i.e. memory foam, inner spring, etc.) I looked at the offerings from numerous vendors.  In the end, it was between Sleep Ez and Flobeds because both offered unglued layers that can be split down the middle for maximum flexibility.  I picked Sleep Ez strictly because it was a better value, and I couldn't be more happy with my decision.The service I received from Sleep Ez was excellent.  I received my mattress and foundation within a week of placing my order, and the assembly couldn't be easier.  You will need a helper to put everything together.Having slept on the bed for two months, I can say without a doubt that this was better than my old inner spring from Simmons.  While somewhat softer than the Simmons, my back feels better after a good nights sleep.  I went with the Talalay Latex for all 3 layers (soft, medium, firm), but I suppose going medium, firm, extra firm would also be okay.  For the record, I'm probably what you would call an average-sized man.
