The restaurant looked really nice and the place seemed really cool. As soon as we were ready to order our food, no waiter was available. We waited at least 10 minutes for someone to take a order. I ordered the frozen hot chocolate and the classic crepe with fresh berries and whipped creme. I was hoping the frozen hot chocolate would be really sweet and tasty.... NOPE. It was bitter and water-y and not close to sweet and the crepe, SO BLAND. You would think the whipped creme would be sweet but instead it was tasteless and thick. I think the only flavorful thing on the crepe was the berries. I was so disappointed.
