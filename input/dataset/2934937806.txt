Dirty, neglected, not safe....3 feelings you have as a parents. Yes, my son loved it, so two stars.  But like others said, half the games are broken, and probably has been for years. I am sure arcades like this don't make a lot of money, and owner seems like a nice guy, but he needs to focus on things he CAN control, like a bathroom that doesn't smell like a portopotty, cleaning the games and place in general, removing dangerous items, covering electrical outlets. Etc.  Yes, it wouldnt still be run down with games from 1993, but at least I would feel dirty while there and my son loves it.  It would be a great place if cleaned every week at least, and hopefully  one day get a guy to fix the games so 80 percent workI will not be back for a long time and hope it is fixed up
