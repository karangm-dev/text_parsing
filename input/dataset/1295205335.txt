I went here with my mother, brother and his girlfriend for my brothers' birthday. Let's just say I'm only giving 2 stars because the sangria was lovely.......Eggplant parm was fine Pizzas were tasteless Alla Gigi was bad....all the dressings were set and hardWould never come back....not worth your $$$$$
