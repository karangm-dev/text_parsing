Our extended family has taken our pets here for many years and I highly recommend this office.  Dr. Brigdon is a fabulous vet, takes time and care with the animals, and the owners,too!  She has helped us through many difficult times, offering sound veterinarian advice.  The staff here is wonderful.  On many occasions, they have gone above and beyond to help us with scheduling etc.  Always friendly, polite and responsible.  In summary, I know if my dog or kitty is ill, she will get the BEST care here!
