Watch out if you go with kids for lunch buffet. The owner makes up cut-off ages for child rate on the fly. Food is ok, nothing outstanding. Attitude of the owner is disappointing. Most places have 12 yrs as cut off for kids. And 4 or 5 yrs may be for free kids. I don't mind paying whatever the kids ages. But then do please post the ages. I don't want to stand at the check out and discuss why is she charging me so much!
