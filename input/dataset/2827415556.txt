This is our go-to place for special occasions.  The lump crab meat appetizer will melt in your mouth.  Don't go if you are in a hurry.  This is a dining experience.  The staff are engaging and professional.  I have never had anything that I didn't think was outstanding.  If you go on a weekend there will be music in the bar area.  Always top notch.
