Came here with a group of 5 people including me...Did a family style ordering, getting things like O.C., General Tao's, egg rolls, rice dishes, etc.Service was fast and everything was piping hot.No lie, the best orange chicken I have ever had!!!Kicker, everyone ate and was full, and the cost was just over 30$! Amazing
