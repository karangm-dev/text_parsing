Food was OK, but if you are picky about ingredients make sure to ask your waiter.  We ordered the scallops from the appetizer menu and when we received the order it looked like 6 scallops were on the plate.  Turns out 3 of them were deep fried rice balls which were not listed on the menu.  We can't eat these due to our particular diet.  When we pointed this out to the manager she did nothing.  This place is right around the corner from home, so was hoping for better service.
