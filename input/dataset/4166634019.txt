First, this is NOT a Mexican restaurant. Second, it is not Tex-Mex. It is their own version of what that means. Having had friends from Mexico (Chihuahua) who owned a Mexican restaurant, this food is not consistent with my normal experience with Mexican food in the USA or Mexico.For example the red sauce has ground BEEF in it. If I order a Chicken product, I really do NOT want beef on it. They call this red sauce their 'gravy.' I asked for just a plain red sauce instead, expecting a red taco sauce, and what they put on the food was not a red chili sauce, it was more orange and not spicy or flavorful in anyway.The chicken was not breast meat. It was the cheaper thigh and leg dark meat. They have Filet Minion on the menu, but they give you cheap chicken parts for the chicken meals.You could order the shredded chicken. A fellow dinner did order that and it was just a plain shredded chicken breast. No spicing, no flavoring.They do not have normal salsa. They give you a HEATED spicy/flavorful/red dipping sauce. As well they have a guacamole/green/creamy dipping sauce as well. It was tasty but not anything I had seen before.If you object to garlic, beware. It is in EVERYTHING. I consider garlic a cheap flavor enhancer. Restaurants that rely on it for the flavor rate LOW in my opinion. With all the REAL spices and flavors, don't cheap out with garlic.I was excited to see a new restaurant open in this location, but sadly, it is not my style. I wish I had known this before having my Birthday dinner there. It kind of ruined it for me.
