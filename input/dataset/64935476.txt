When I originally brought my vehicle in, they quoted me $2,200 worth of work needed on a vehicle that was only worth about $1,800. However, after a few discounts, they got it down to $1,750. They also assured me they'd looked over the whole vehicle, and that it was worth saving, and worth investing my money in. That it didn't need anything else. Boy they could not have been more wrong.While still in the shop for the first repair, right before they returned it to me, another part failed, and I had to add another $200 to my cost for repairs.Within a week of the first repair, the vehicle went down again, for a second fault that they failed to identify the first time, which was another $615 repair.And now, less than a month later, it needs repairs again - at least another $600. The repairs they've done have been OK, but promising me my vehicle was worth saving when I've now had to put twice its value into it just to get it to start doesn't work for me.They should have just told me they didn't know if the vehicle was worth saving or not. Then, I could have made a more informed decision about the repairs. Instead, they were so desperate for the revenue that they made a bad recommendation, and now I'm stuck with it.I absolutely would not recommend going here. They will tell you whatever they think you need to hear to get work done with them, regardless of whether it is in your best interests or not.
