This is by far my favorite place to come eat brunch and sit on a patio. I've been here 4 times and this place has not let me down once with food or service. Today we ordered the Mediterranean salad and bruschetta. The bruschetta choice we picked were the Brussels sprouts, avocado, and tomato/basil. The Brussels sprouts was my favorite but they are all very good. We ate our meal with a Fig Mule to sip on. That was also tasteful and not to sweet. Can't wait to come back again, don't know why I always wait to long to.
