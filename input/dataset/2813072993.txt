Do not eat here!!! The food is cold! Health Department should shut this place down.  Came in for lunch saturday and spent $15.95 for cold disgusting chinese food which is no different from any other $5.99 chinese buffet.  Complained to our server that the food was cold, he nicely went to tell a manager. 10 Minutes later a manager, James comes over with an attitude that he knew the food was cold and didnt really care.  No discount, or and help trying to fix the food problem. What a rip off $40 for a cold lunch STAY AWAY!!
