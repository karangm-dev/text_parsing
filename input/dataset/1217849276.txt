Don't treat this place as just your average donut shoppe! It's all that and a bag of chips (literally they sell chips too) Not only do they offer scrumptious freshly made donuts and pastries & hot breakfast items but a wide variety of deli style sandwiches as well!! I've been here so many times but I've yet to order lunch!? I tried a turkey & cheese on a buttery croissant- it was so big I couldn't finish it! I ordered the combo which came with a bag of chips, fountain drink and choice of donut. My sandwich was outstanding and I will be back to try more.
