I don't know whose life this is fit for, but it isn't mine! I'm an area with a multitude of great lunch options, this place tends to fall short. Bloor/Yonge lunch places pride themselves on giving you a whole bunch of food for not a lot of money, so it's almost a foreign concept to feel cheated of portions. However, they are very, VERY cheap when it comes to things like toppings. I ordered a turkey club panini, that came with lettuce, tomatoes, and I could count the individual cooked onions they sprinkled on top. I also asked for jalapeños, and got 3 small slices. I mean, I get it, they can't give me a mountain of food, but having enough toppings to cover most of the surface area of my sammich seems standard, no? Anyhow, I paid for my sandwich, but noticed a fatal flaw: no bacon! So I had to take it back. They were very nice about it and offered to make me a new sandwich. However, new sandwich didn't have those jalapeños I had originally wanted. This sounds like a "so what suck it up millennial princess" moment, but here's the rub: the sandwich had no flavour without them. The turkey, bacon, bread, and veggies all just tasted like cardboard. (I have ordered this sandwich before and remember thinking "this is decent!", so maybe it was just an off sandwich).My friend orders boxes here and swears by them. Maybe they are a better bet, but with so many options in the area I don't know if I can survive more lunchappointment. That's disappointment in lunch. I made it up, so what?
