Oh why didn't I read these reviews before buying a new battery.  Took my wife's car in for an oil change and after the service advisor recommended a new battery I took it to O'Reilly and had it replaced yesterday.  I have a hunch there's nothing wrong with the battery though since it's only 2 years old.  Typical move based on what I've read about these guys on here.  Won't go back, hello Camelback!
