I have never been to Smoothie King before in general so was unfamiliar with the menu. In addition I had two kids with me. From the minute I walked through the door, the girl that helped us was annoyed with us for breaking up her gossip session with friends that were at a table. she barely helped me through the menu and was just unpleasant in General. I will find another location to visit based on this experience.
