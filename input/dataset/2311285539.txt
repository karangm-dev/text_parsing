Roy Temple saved the day! My water heater died over the weekend while my husband was traveling. Roy came out on a Sunday, bright eyed and bushy tailed to fix me right up. He gave me a courtesy call and showed up right on time. After evaluating and explaining the situation to me,  he got to work and had kept me in the loop the whole time. He worked quickly and efficiently leaving no trace that he was ever here -- besides the new water heater! Roy at BSJ will be my first call next time I need any appliances installed! What an easy process! Thanks so much!
