Segway Steve picked us up at our hotel and drove us to our tour. We had a great time seeing the sights and hearing about some of the history and lore of Las Vegas. I doubt we'd have seen Freemont St. on our own but I'm glad we had the opportunity to experience it. We really enjoyed this tour. Thanks Steve! I'm sending a couple of friends your way later this summer.
