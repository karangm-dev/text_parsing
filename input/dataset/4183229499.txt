Best Thai food in Charlotte.  I have been going here for 9 years and It's always good.  Try the Pad Thai (Thai style) and the Som Tom (green papaya salad).  I also like the Rad Nar with seafood and the Yellow curry and the penang curry.  You can order spice level 1-4 so they will make it your spice level.  The servers are some of the sweetest and kindest people I have ever met.  I consider them family.  Beautiful souls.  Also the sweet iced tea is great.  They use Jasmine tea and it's perfect.  This place is pure love.
