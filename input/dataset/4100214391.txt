I'm giving 2 stars because 1.5 of those is for our waitress alone. It took 30+ minutes for us to be seated, the venue was not packed. Once we were seated, we sat for about 15 min with no drinks. Our waitress came over, apologized because she didn't know we were her section and took our app and drink orders. We got the guacamole, freshly made in house - which made me excited. It wasn't bad. The veggie tacos though, if the veggies were supposed to be cooked they did a terrible job. We really could not leave soon enough. And the icing on the cake, I left with an instant stomach ache.
