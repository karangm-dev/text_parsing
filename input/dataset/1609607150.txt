A company or a person is only as good as it's word. I joined this gym about eight years ago. The club hadn't even opened yet but they were selling memberships across the street. They made me an offer that if I prepaid for two years up front, I would be considered a charter member (I believe I was number eight) and as such receive a discounted yearly membership at a fixed price for life. For the past seven years they stayed true to their promise/contract. This year - they reneged on their promise and doubled their membership fee.Two and 1/2 weeks ago I went to the gym to discuss this matter and was told they couldn't do anything about it as it came from "corporate" but I was told that they would forward this matter to corporate and have someone contact me. Needless to say, this hasn't happened. This company makes you stand by your contract. Good luck and try to break your contract should you not want to go this gym. However it seems that they can break at any time for any reason.I can no longer recommend 24 Hour Fitness (or any company) that treats their loyal customers (or any customer) like they have treated me.
