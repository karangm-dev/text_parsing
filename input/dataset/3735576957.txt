So much fun! I had never heard of this place but my boyfriend had and took me here. Didn't tell me it was one of those places where the servers are mean to you on purpose. He just said I'll like it. I did. I love places like that! They of course gave us the paper hats, mine said "Harry potter makes me moist". My boyfriend's said "So small I pee on my balls". It was fun reading other ppls hats and having ppl laugh at ours. They talk crap to you if catch you on your phone, they make inappropriate jokes about the food. They prob re use those lines so I won't tell you what they say, lol. Don't want to kill your experience but they had us laughing. We also got accused of watching porn when we both were looking at something on my phone. Haha good times. I would come back.
