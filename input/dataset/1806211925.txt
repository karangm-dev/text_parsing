New to Las Vegas and having a difficult time finding a good barber.There were two things I asked John not to do. Do not cut my hair short in the front and do not follow the shape of the top of my head.I asked for a four and he cut it all one size that was much smaller than a four.On top of that he left a bunch of longer hairs sticking up.The sides were good, but that does't do any good when the rest is wrong.I let him know I was unhappy.He did not apologize or offer any type of resolve.This was my first and last time there.
