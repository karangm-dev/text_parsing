This is probably the gold-standard of Las Vegas buffets. I'm not counting Bally's Sterling brunch (which I haven't tried) because it's in its own class (caviar, lobster...and roughly triple the cost). I've certainly tried the buffets at Paris, Wynn, Rio, and a few others, but Bellagio is the one I keep coming back to.On my most recent visit, I was particularly happy with the very obviously freshly squeezed orange juice (other places still use those Minute Maid machine juices), and with the spicy tuna handrolls that are made to order.I won't go on and on about the wide variety and quality of food; just know that if you're going to have a buffet while you're in Vegas, go to the Bellagio one.
