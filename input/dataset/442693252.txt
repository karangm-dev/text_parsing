After a bad experience with my last vet, I spent a ton of time getting referrals and doing research to find the best choice for my sweet puppy, and it sure paid off at Phoenix Mountain Animal Hospital. Dr. Kanarish is incredibly knowledgeable and great at answering questions. He's a good communicator and can explain the choices he makes and what the different options are, and I really appreciate his perspective. In fact, the entire was was professional and knowledgeable. Our puppy liked Dr. K, too, and gave him kisses right away. Definitely recommended.
