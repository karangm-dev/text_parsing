Absolutely horrendous. I decided to chose this place to order off GrubHub instead of Olive Garden. Bad decision. I ordered clam linguine, which comes with a side salad and your choice of bread & calamari. Where do I begin? The calamari was obviously from a frozen package. Super chewy and tasted like a fried peice of rubber. The clam linguine? PSA: Do not expect to find any cans of clams at your local supermarket. All of them have been used in this bowl of linguine. I would have prefered 3 peices of REAL clam instead of those huge portion of salted rubber on my bowl. Ontop of that, it was SMOTHERED in oil. (See pictures above). I ended up scrapping the clams off and using the marina sauce from the calamari in the pasta. The salad was the only edible part of this meal, and even then, I used my own ranch dressing instead of the oil grease that came with it. As I began eating the salad, I noticed this dried up black speck. Ended up being a fly......................................................................................................DISGUSTING ! $30 down the drain! I hope I do not end up with food poising in the morning!STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!
