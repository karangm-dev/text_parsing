I live in downtown - I have lived in downtown for over a year + now & I also work at the edge of the Strip District going into downtown... so the Strip District is VERY convenient for me to say the least.I find the best variety for fresh food at great cheap prices all up & down the Strip District. My fianc√© & I both have found that doing our grocery shopping here is MUCH cheaper/better/easier than going to Giant Eagle or any where else for that matter.All the small business owners are super friendly, more than willing to help you, & once they start to recognize you as 'regular' will sometimes throw you some extra deals or some extras from time to time which is amazing.I will tell you that it's VERY crowded on Fridays/Saturdays... so be prepared for that. Sundays aren't too bad crowd wise but if you want to visit here & not have any real crowds at all to deal with then go during Mondays/Tuesdays as these are the more dead days of the week.Also, make sure you have SOME cash on you - not all vendors take cards - just a lil tip.
