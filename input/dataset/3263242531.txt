We actually happened to come across Mid Century Modern Furniture by accident. We wondered in and looked around and were blown away by what they had to offer. We had the pleasure of dealing with Mark. He was very knowledgeable about what was offered. He listened to us about what we were looking for to decorate our new home. We ended up purchasing many paintings and accessories. When we got them home we weren't quite sure where to hang them all, so Mark came to our house and helped us hang them perfectly! He went above and beyond. I could not have asked for a better buying experience. The only thing better than the paintings we purchased was the service and attention to detail we received from Mark and Mid Century Modern Furniture! Because our first experience was such a pleasure, there is no doubt we will be back to do business again!
