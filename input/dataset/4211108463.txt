This place was absolutely awful. In August I paid them a deposit of $370. to recover 3 bar stools in black leather, with another $360. due when the job was done. After hearing nothing after 6 weeks I called a was told next week. This went on every week for another six weeks. I finally went in person and the guy said give me 2 days- supposedly they only just found where they put the chair.  Five days later I went in person again and once again nothing was done. I took my bar stool back and asked that they refund my Visa the $370. They claimed the guy who could do it wasn't in until Wednesday although there was only ever the one guy dealing with all transactions and he was the same guy who processed my Visa payment so total lie. Now I have to try to dispute these charges through my Visa. Totally don't recommend this place and whatever you do don't pay until the service is provided or you will be rippedUpdate some weeks later after some back and forth I did finally get my deposit refunded, so not a complete disaster
