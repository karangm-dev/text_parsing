Today after long hours of walking up and down Rue St Denis.  I needed something good, something sweet..... Voila! There it was! A tiny store that screamed Gelato!  We walked in and the lovely woman holding a tray of incredible edibles let loose with a string of French and thrust the tray at us.  I didn't care what they were these little chunks of chocolate and nuts could have had encased within.  I popped in my mouth and it was truly wondrous!  I only wished I knew enough French to say "hold me".  Because it was that kind of moment!  When she realized we spoke no French she explained that this delicious morsel was simple a slice of apple encased in chocolate and nuts! Lies, I tell you! It was so crunchy yet soft and flavorful! I knew I had to try the gelato...which was everything I desired and more.  I had one scoop of Raspberry(framboise) and cream with another scoop of Chocolate and Caramel.  Served with a healthy hunk of dark chocolate on top!  The best part was there was a sale going on and everything was half price!  What could I say? So going back tomorrow...and the next day, and....
