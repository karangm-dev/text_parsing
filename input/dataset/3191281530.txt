Had some time before an appointment and stopped in as they had 5 * rating.The restaurant itself isn't anything special. Greeted by friendly husband wife duo.Ordered Carne  burrito with beans and rice to be safe.Immediately could tell ingredients were fresh. Meat was tasty. Juicy. Owner states he trims and cooks all meats in house. 3 types of salsa are available. All are flavorful, fresh and made in house.Owner gave me a free barbacoa taco. Wonderful flavor.I'm a big guy and couldn't eat it allTry em if you are in the neighborhood.
