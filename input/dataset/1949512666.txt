To begin with,Ive been to taco Y taco 3 times. The last visit was by far the worst. To begin with the restaurants layout is marginal at best.  It's confusing and has multiple lines, which would be a cool concept if other people had the same understanding. We waited in line for probably 10 minutes because everyone was just as confused as I was. Finally, we squeeze our way through to the front of the burrito line, and we were met with the absolute worst customer service my small brain could imagine. Being a restaurant connoisseur, I knew I wanted Al Pastor which was the meat for my burrito. She asked what I want, and I had to repeat myself 4 times before she interrupted saying that there was no Al Pastor. I saw it? But that didn't discourage me. Being a Good Samaritan, I kept going without a complaint. When I sat down to eat, the food was dry and bland, and tasted low quality. Me and my squad will never return to here. We are utterly hungry and pitifully disappointed. Chipotle Is two miles down the street.
