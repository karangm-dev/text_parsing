I found this gem a few years ago for my 6 pups and am so happy I did.  I have three little show dogs which they groom, special condition, and cut the exact way each dog should be for the breed.  They go above and beyond the normal groomers cut and style and they smell Devine when they are finished .  As for the other three big boy dogs I have, the groomer girlz love on them and treat them just as if they were royalty or as their own!! All 6 of my dogs know the routine every two weeks, the can't wait to get groomed. All 6 of them load as fast as they can I to my truck, patiently panting until they see the shop and boom bust out my truck and run straight to the paws attraction doors waiting to lick the sweet ladies!  I love this place, if you are like me and your doggies are as precious as your children then trust me this is the only place you will want them groomed.  They hand dry and style them and they even let some babies play around and enjoy socializing. Love love love this place.
