Thanks to my vegetarian friend, I tried ChuChai a few years back. Honestly, we used to go to the "bistro" side, which was much less expensive, until they changed the menu and our favorite (duck in red curry with tomatoes and pineapple sauce), so we transferred to the formal dining room restaurant, which tends to be expensive for my taste.That being said, the spring rolls with peanut sauce, the eggplants in basilic sauce and the duck in red curry sauce tastes like heaven! (Ça goûte le ciel!)
