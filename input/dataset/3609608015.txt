Wow this place is a joke, this is coming from a middle eastern. The waitress wasn't bad but for a group of people you don't give just two pieces of pita bread. How do five people share that? The silverware is flimsy and the knifes dirty. The food really isn't that great either, if I wasn't so hungry I probably wouldn't even eat it. This place is gross and a waste of your money.
