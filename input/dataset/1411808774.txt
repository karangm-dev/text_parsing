Thank you so much to Robert and JC computer and repair for fixing my phone so fast on Saturday when I needed it so bad. I was changing my battery at other place in Faburary and found out from Robert that that battery was some generic piece of crap and also display was changed like in March or April (what I also was thinking was low quality as even after it was put in I had problems swiping and it wouldn't respond once in a while I had to reset phone to get it working). Right now writing my review from my "brand new" phone and it fills like it New even though it's 2,5 years old works exactly how it was working when I bought it new. I can notice in quality of parts and as happy consumer I appreciate HONEST buisness!)     Thanks a lot, Robert, will refer all my friends and family to you
