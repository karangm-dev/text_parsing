This hotel has decent rooms and pool, however they are completely not organized and are understaffed. They have a free "shuttle" service within 5 miles radius which seems amazing. It was fine for getting to places but getting back to the hotel was impossible! We called them to pick us up twice and they said they would send someone.  Both times we waited 45 minutes. The first time after waiting we called to ask where the shuttle was and the shuttle was never sent out and was out on another call, so we would have to wait even longer!!! After paying a taxi to get us back to our hotel the shuttle was sitting in the front! A similar experience occurred with the shuttle service the second time. They have no system for using the shuttle or for getting a hold of the drivers. This is NOT the drivers fault it is on hotel management who need to get their stuff together. Our driver Brian was great! He was friendly and was always around to help with whatever we needed. Literally, he did a little bit of everything at the hotel from shuttle services to working on canoes and unloading cars. I hope they give him a raise!  I am amazed that this company offers little customer service for being in the hospitably business There is also a  female front desk  attendant who is completely unfriendly and rude to customers, while there is a male attendant who is good. We will not be back to this establishment and will not recommend it to anyone until they figure out systems that work.
