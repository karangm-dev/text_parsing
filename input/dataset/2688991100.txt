In a word 'HORRIBLE!' Service at the bar was like we were invisible - hello, can we get a beer?!? Not only us, but others said the same.  Got the stuffed seafood portobello mushroom - WHAT seafood?!? The bottom part was hot and the stuffing was cold - not at all appealing. The place is filthy too! Don't go here!
