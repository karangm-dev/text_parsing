This store is going down hill fast. The other day I was looking for something as simple as coffee filters. They did not have any 8-12 cup sizes available. As I walked down the aisle, I noticed the mangers coming my way. When I told them what they were missing, they dismissed me like I was some scrub. Today, I went looking for something as simple as chorizo. They were out of it, and the other day when I went looking for Jimmy Dean sausage they were out of that as well. (We wound up using another brand which made our biscuits and gravy very bland) Their water machine has been broken for two weeks so I had to buy water by the gallon. (Which becomes expensive) Their hot food selections are typically sitting there for eons. (I tried the wings which were barely edible) Sorry to say it, but it is now worth it to drive the extra one-minute to Winco even for small trips. They have way lower prices and always have everything in stock.
