I bought a house that had a safe with a dial.type lock which while definitely secure is a bit slow to open and makes me want to use the safe less often. I did have a business card from The Safe Keeper attached to opening instructions that was left by the seller. I went online, found their website and emailed them regarding changing to an electronic lock. They replied in the affirmative the next morning. I called and scheduled the work which was done within two days of my first contact. The service technician, Vid, was on time, knowledgeable, very personable and completed the changeover in the timeframe he had quoted even while explaining everything about the safe, the locking mechanism and answering all my questions.This was a great experience with a top notch company. I couldn't be more pleased.
