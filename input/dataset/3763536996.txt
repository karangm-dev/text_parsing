Airport restaurant food... never too impressive and just like this restaurant. They are just trying to pump out the bar and food.  Service took a little long. I ordered the Margarita Grilled Chicken which was a low calorie item, didn't  want to feel bloated on the plane. Food quality was below average, the chopped tomato on top of the chicken was really cold so when I bit into it I thought the chicken was raw. The chicken was really small. Way more rice than meat. Flavour, there wasn't  much to it but make sure you squeeze the lime into it to add it some acidic taste or else it is bland.
