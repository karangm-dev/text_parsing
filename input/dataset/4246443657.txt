I've been eating to check this place out for a while. Everyday I go by this restaurant and thinking I have to check it out! Recently we finally check this place out. I LOVE it. We got the fried Calamari and Autunno Bianca. Our waitress told us that is her favorite and one of the most popular pizza. The calamari was good and  so was the pizza. When I first got it, to be honest, I was not impressed with it. I was expecting more, I felt like it was lacking flavors. At that point, I was giving this pizza a 5.5 out of 10. But shortly after I ate more of it, I realized it was much better now. I'm not sure it was the parmesan cheese + hot pepper made the difference or the hot sausage flavor started to kick in. It was very flavorful and the crust was prefect. I had some leftovers the next day and ended up loving it more! I will definitely go back there and try out some different pizza or pasta. They do have happy hours but it is for drinks only, I think it was $1 off wine $2 off draft or the other way around. It is not a bad deal but I wish they would bring on some food specials for happy hour!
