There is a great little Italian Market located in a strip plaza in Cornelius, NC that will have everything you are looking for. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Fresh sweet or hot sausage, and fresh meats as well. Homemade  meatballs, lasagna rolls, antipasto salad and kalamata olives are  only a few of the items in the full on deli case. Beautiful bread selection.  The inside Wall is lined  with olive oils, lupini beans, sauces, tomatoes, wine and dried pasta. Nice Italian cookies, pizzelles and biscotti and more. Hard to find Italian Nougat candies! They will be for my next visit to Ferrucci's !
