First off, KUDOS to this clinic for getting me in IMMEDIATELY on a Friday at 4:45 p.m. with no warning! I have been going to Dr. Alber for quite a few years with both my little guys. About a week ago, I had to rush one of my little guys here. My disappointment was palpable when I learned Dr. Alber was no longer part of this animal hospital. My heart sunk. Now what do I do? This sucks, I thought.Dr. Carter to the rescue! He is FANTASTIC! Absolutely spot on, kind, gentle and really thorough. I am so happy Dr. Alber found someone so awesome to fill his shoes! Thank you Dr. Carter for getting Woodstock in on an emergency basis! (Yes, there was a $72 fee for the work in- which I thought was a bit steep, but still way cheaper than what it would have cost me to go to the emergency clinic.) I have always given Dr. Alber a 5 star rating, and I am thankful to say Prestige Animal Clinic still gets my 5 stars. It gives me peace of mind to know I have this fantastic vet on deck. Oh, and Woodstock liked him a lot too! And that's what is really the important thing!
