Definitely the best antique store in Cleveland. Freddie has excellent taste, amazing prices and is incredibly helpful when it comes to selecting a piece as well as providing contacts for restoration & re-upholstery. I have certainly appreciated his efforts, as I'm sitting in a barrel back chair from his store while writing this.
