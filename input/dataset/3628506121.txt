87 West has a great atmosphere, awesome drink menu that changes seasonally and tremendous service! Donn was our server! He was knowledgable about the wine, liquor menu and the food menu! I highly reccomend the chicken salad sliders! This place does not allow children or babies, which is nice for an adult evening out! Fun place for a date or a night out with friends!
