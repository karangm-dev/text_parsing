I have been a client of Quan's for over 10 years. He is a wonderful massage therapist. He has helped me with shoulder and knee pain. He was able to diagnose a torn meniscus and mild arthritis before it was confirmed by an MRI. He is a wonderful person who charges a fair amount for his services. He sometimes uses a lot of pressure that might be painful for some people, but I find his style very effective.
