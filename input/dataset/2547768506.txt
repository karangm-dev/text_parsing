I wanted to like this salon- it seemed cute and trendy.. I had just had a baby and was really looking forward to a fresh new haircut.  Unfortunately my experience was disappointing.  The front desk attendant offered the person who came in about 10 minutes after me a cup of tea, but failed to offer me any tea until that point when he realized he had forgotten to ask me if I wanted tea as well.  As soon as he brought the tea to me my stylist was ready so I didn't get an opportunity to drink it.  I showed my stylist pictures of what I wanted and explained in detail what I did and did not want.  She said she could do it and proceeded to cut my hair without conversing with me at all the whole time.  As a disclaimer I have curly/wavy hair.  I asked for side swept bangs that blended into my layers. The stylist insisted on blowing my hair out straight when she was finished-including a full fringe of blunt cut bangs on my forehead.  When I got home and examined my hair I saw all the layers were uneven and there was no way to style the bangs except to pull them back with bobby pins.  I now go to another salon and the person who cuts my hair does so for less than this salon charged- and it looks great every time...I was really disappointed because its seems like other people had good experiences at this salon.
