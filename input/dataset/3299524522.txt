Horrible car wash the last few times I've been there.  The worst part is they up sell every single time and they still don't give you a good wash.  Today I got in my car after they finished and it was still very dusty and they hadn't thrown the trash out.  I had an empty cup in there from Dutch Bros. and they didn't even bother to toss it out.  No scent which was part of the package either.  Super frustrating.
