This is a long overdue review.   Max automotive is the best place you can take your vehicle to for repairs.   We had recently taken our 2001 explorer to a local dealership to look at and they quoted us over 2k to fix a supposedly broken condenser.   We were in a pinch and couldn't afford to shell out that much prior to a road trip to California with my family.   I reached out to Max and they were super helpful and got us in right away and quickly found out that the issue had nothing to do with the condenser and was simply a case of replacing some manifold hoses that were leaking.  600 bucks later we were good to go!  These guys are first class honest folks who go the extra mile to help you.   I would highly recommend them to any of my friends in a heart beat.  Thanks guys for helping fix our vehicle!
