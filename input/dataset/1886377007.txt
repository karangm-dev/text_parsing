This is my new favorite Chinese spot here in Phoenix!!! I travel back and forth between the Phoenix area and Northern CA and have been looking for a good Chinese restaurant here in Phoenix and have finally found it!!! The food was wonderfully DELICIOUS and fairly inexpensive with the majority of entr√©es priced at less than $10 dollars each. We ordered the sweet-n-sour chicken/pork, house fried rice, and shrimp w/ broccoli. There was plenty of meat in the rice including shrimp. There was plenty of shrimp in the broccoli and we were even able to get $2. of beef added to the shrimp w/ broccoli which was also good amount of meat to make our own combo dish. The service was fast as others have reported. The dining space was very limited and not very inviting but the food for me is the best that I've had here in the Phoenix area and is the place to beat for me. At this point I'm willing to make the 20+ minute drive from our place any and every time that I want Chinese food while in Phoenix.My only con was the lack of ambiance and limited appetizer menu.Thanks to all those who have posted your opinions to Yelp as the reviews for this place were the driving factor for us trying it out. The rave reviews are much warranted!!
