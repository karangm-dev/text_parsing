Was in town from LA with some friends, so glad we found this place! Great food - unique sandwiches, homemade ingredients. We had some lobster bisque that was to die for. We chatted for a while with the friendly owner, who gave us some tips on things to do around town. I'll definitely be back if I'm ever in the area again.
