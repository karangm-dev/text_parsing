Been looking at this place awhile. The yelp reviews are mixed so me and the wife have hesitated. After being tempted by the steak menu (which looks amazing) finally i decided to make a reservation for the wife's birthday. On the website it clearly states locals get a 15% discount. Clearly. So i called the week before to make a reservation for Monday Aug 10th-not a holiday that i know of. I made my reservation then asked about the discount only to be told they don't honor that anymore! ITS ON THE WEBSITE! I emailed the Luxor to explain why i canceled my reservation-and they told me they honor whats on there website(-holidays and weekends i believe) So the hostess has 3 jobs. To take reservations, seat people & know the offers the restaurant has! If she/they cant get that simple communication right-this place isn't worth the phone call i made. I think based on this basic screw up i would not feel comfortable blowing $150-200 for a dinner. To many options in town
