I was feeling the afternoon drag this past Saturday and so stopped by here with my girlfriend for a cup of coffee.  There isn't much to say about the decor of the place as it is stashed in a hallway over by the ballrooms and has some tables and a single TV.  I ended up ordering the 16 oz dark roast while my girlfriend had a 16 oz iced tea.  Almost $8, ouch, but it is Vegas.  The coffee was strong but not particularly good and the iced tea was just decent.  I feel like I probably could have had better coffee playing the slots.The bottom line for me is that I wouldn't be back here in the future.  The coffee just wasn't that great.
