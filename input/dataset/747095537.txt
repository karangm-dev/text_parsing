I was moving back to Las Vegas for work and wanted to buy a house. I did a lot of research in finding a mortgage broker and ended up going with Casey. What first impressed me is that she was very quick to respond to my email and voicemail. She did not try to hard pressure sell me on anything but just genuinely wanted to help.  She was dependable and honest when explaining my expectations.  As a first time home buyer I felt like it was a huge undertaking but Casey's help during the entire loan process made it feel easy.  She showed her true knowledge as a lending professional from recommending a realtor to the title company we wound up using.  She worked diligently to keep me up to date on the process throughout the entire loan from start to finish. I can tell she had her systems in place and a great team to work with. I will be recommending her to all my Friends and Family!
