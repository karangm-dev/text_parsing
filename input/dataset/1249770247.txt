This Starbucks has to have THE SLOWEST SERVICE OF ALL TIME. If there are more than four cars in the drive thru, expect to wait at least 15 minutes. Don't expect kind service either. I'm not sure why this location can't get its act together, but thankfully there are two other Starbucks nearby that work much more quickly and efficiently.
