Louis-Simon was terrific!  We booked a private tour (4 people) with him and he was incredibly knowledgeable about the city, its history as well as fun facts about every day Montreal life.  He was also very flexible as we saw things along the way that we wanted to spend extra time on, etc... Highly recommend him and Ca Roule.
