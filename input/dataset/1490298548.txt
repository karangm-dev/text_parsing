Came into Walmart for a Bluetooth device to connect my phone in my car I had to return 3 different times because all 3 devices I purchased did not work . The second time the employee " Karen" at customer service was very rude I asked her to ask an associate to bring me up another device because I was tired of walking the entire store for something that isn't working and she gave me and attitude asked me if I wanted to walk back myself than had another associate come all the way to the front just for me to tell him what I needed when she could have told him to bring the item I wanted to save the trip. Very poor customer service.
