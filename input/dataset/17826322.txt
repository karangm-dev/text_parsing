Amazing. This has become my fav sushi in the valley. The fish quality is second to none and the rolls are well prepared. Add to that the fact that the owner is so accomidating (six buck bottles of top shelf sake, free miso and edamame, as well as other freebees) make this place a must go to. The decor leaves a bit to be desited, but with prices and quality this good, who cares?
