I give it 5 stars based on value.  The hotel is modern and clean. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. I think I received great value for the price I paid. I booked directly through their www.bookit.com.  I paid $49.00 including tax with their pre-fixed breakfast (which included 2 eggs, home fries, and bacon/sausage- with coffee or tea, made to order).  Someone on Yelp said it used to be a Holiday Inn. It's laid out just like one with underground parking, and small bar/dining area lounge.  Las Vegas was a stop over before heading to the Grand Canyon, so this hotel was perfect for our purpose.  It was clean, modern, inexpensive, and convenient.  I'd stay here again.
