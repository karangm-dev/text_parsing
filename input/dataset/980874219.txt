I don't even think my own mother could make soup better than Ravi.You may think to yourself that soup isn't a meal.  You may think to yourself that soup isn't worth basing an entire restaurant around.  You may even be so crazy as to think that you're not really that into soup.  Well, not only would you be wrong all all counts, you've clearly never been to Ravi Soups.You have options.  There are beef soups, squash soups, lentil soups, curried soups, everything!  When you order soup, it comes with a biscuit and some different jam type things that you can eat with it.But, I concede, sometimes you want more than a soup.  They've got wraps.  In fact they have a soup and wrap combo, which comes with a slightly smaller soup, and a smaller wrap, but which satisfies so thoroughly, that you really wonder if you'll ever be this happy again.  The answer is yes: on your next trip to Ravi's.The only downside is that it's not free.  In addition to not being free, it's not super cheap, either.  A soup or combo meal will cost you anywhere from $10-$13.
