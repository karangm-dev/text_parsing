It's sad that I'm giving RM's a 2 star review, but that's all that's deserved at this point. I came with a party of 4 on a friday night and it wasn't at all busy. We were seated quickly, but later asked to be moved to a more comfortable seating area where there was more lighting and a bit more lively. My husband started with clam chowder soups, which arrived luke warm to our table and was a major disappointment in temperature, taste and consistency. Then we ordered some sushi and rolls and it was another disappointment.In a nut shell 2 clam chowder soups for $30,  2 orders of 6 pc sushi for $38 and an $8 beer for a grand total of $76 and that was only for two people. I did a quick estimate of what my entire table had for dinner and I believe the bill came up to 150 + tax.So if this is what I'm getting for $150 smackaroo's I tell you right now that it's truly disappointing and not worth your time, money and taste buds...  maybe that's why the restaurants was a bit empty when we arrived.
