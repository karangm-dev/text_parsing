My husband and I ate here on a Saturday night around 830pm. There was a very large party, a couple of normal parties, and the bar was about half full. We were seated right away and were given water immediately. My husband and I don't get to go out often so we were taking our time and our server, Eric, never rushed us and kept checking until we decided. As I'm a nursing mother, my son had a dairy allergy so I have to be careful about what I eat. Eric made sure to double check the ingredients before putting my order in. Our food came out fast and hot. The sweet potato fries and calamari were cooked to perfection. My braised beef was so tender than it fell apart using only my fork. My husband got a shrimp and chicken pasta that was so big he had to get a box for half of it. My only complaint is the lighting was very bright...very very bright.
