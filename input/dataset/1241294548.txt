Fantastic work I had done. Plan on going back for a touch up and maybe some more ink. They have a done of ideas on the wall and the guy I sat with had his own suggestions to my design. Each artist has their own room for privacy. I can't remember the guy who did mine but he's tall and has a ton of Star Wars/Marvel toys in his tattoo room. My tattoo was military inspired and the guy who did it thought it was a cool idea. Both happy w results. I'll def be back again
