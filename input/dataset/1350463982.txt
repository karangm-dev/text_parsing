This place is definetly worth checking out. It is a small cozy clean environment with a friendly staff. Talk about needs to be on diners drive ins and dive. The food is outstanding and super reasonable prices. The macaroni salad doesn't make you feel like you're having a heart attack like some other places do. If you're a fan of garlic you must have their garlic shrimp in that extraordinary sauce. Check this place out and bring your friends.
