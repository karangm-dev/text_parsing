A patient for the past three years, with biannual check ups.  Every time I leave after my appointment I ask myself why?  Without a doubt the most screwed up business I have ever seen.  The majority of the time their computer system is down and can not schedule a follow up appointment when I leave.  Their "central" appointment center is a disaster.  I was on hold for over an hour and then before my call was answered, they closed!  The latest is I need a surgical clearance from CVC before I can have out patient surgery for a deviated septum.  Four trips to CVC over the past week and now their doctor wants a stress test.  They have supposedly been scheduling same for three days now.  Assuming I can ever get resolution for my surgical clearance it will be the last time I deal with this entity.
