I had such high hopes for this business idea. I called into the store and asked if I could rent a dress I picked out online for my birthday weekend in Vegas. I was staying at the Cosmo and thought it would be perfect! I arrived to Vegas and walked to the store, excited to see this hot little Herve number. Wrong! They had ordered the dress for the correct date, but incorrect month! My birthday party theme was ruined and I didn't bring a back up dress. I looked horrible in my birthday photos because I didn't match the color theme. They didn't offer to refund me right away, but allow me to choose a dress of my choice in the store. Unfortunately, they don't stock high end dresses there like Herve and their inventory was not attractive. Horrible - will not be counting on Rent the Runway ever again!
