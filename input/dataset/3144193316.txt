This is the second time I've ordered takeout and the portions were skimped on. One salad box was only half full, another 3/4 full. Our pizza also did not look cheesy like the photos here, it was a thin piece of cardboard with the bare minimum. I don't recommend ordering from here especially as they are also really pricey. The only upside and thus 2 stars is that some of the food is quite tasty. So disappointed.
