Was really excited when this first opened but was quickly disappointed after I tried it. The service and the presentation of the ice cream was great and the staff were nice but I thought the ice cream tasted too watered down. It tasted more like ice with some artificial flavors. It didn't have enough creaminess for my taste. I'd still recommend trying it once if nothing more than to see them roll the ice cream cause that part is really cool
