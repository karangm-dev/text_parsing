Sadly disappointed based on the Yelp reviews I read. In Charlotte for the summer and decided to try when my girlfriend came into town. Did brunch on Sunday afternoon. We arrive, restaurant is half empty and are sat immediately. Sitting there, just sitting there. Hostess realizes we could use water, then realizes we don't even have a place setting and she was the one who sat us there. Anyways, we wait for a good 8-10 minutes without any contact from our waiter, only an apology from the hostess. Finally waiter shows up, doesn't seem that interested  and just asks for our order. As a former waiter I was mildly annoyed by this since its usually best to greet the customer, ask if they any questions and make good suggestions. My girlfriend goes with cinnamon rolls/bacon and I end up with the B&G Steak and Eggs with a Bloody Mary and coffee. We wait, we wait some more. OUR FOOD ARRIVES BEFORE OUR DRINKS? Then our waiter finally delivers drinks and makes blunder after blunder after blunder. I seriously don't know what this guy's deal was.The food: Mine was excellent. Steak was perfect (asked for rare, got rare) and the cornmeal pancakes were an amazing addition. Blood Mary almost tasted sweet? Wasn't a fan. My girlfriend's sweet roll was tasty and gourmet tasting but DRY, DRY, DRY. Moral of the story: dropped $60 on non-bottomless brunch for an unusually poor dining experience. I think that was the first time in my life I tipped 12%. Won't be back.
