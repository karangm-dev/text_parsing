I have been wanting to try the food at Pizza Heaven since I moved to Phoenix from the East Valley 3 1/2 yrs ago. My first experience was not so good. I called in my order and the lady who answered was a bit rude. My food was supposed to be ready in about a 1/2 hr but that was not the case. One of the guys gave me and my brother-in-law a piece of pizza to sample since we were waiting so long. Apparently there was some confusion about my order being pick up or delivery. An hr after I called in the order, my food magically appeared. It was sitting on top of the oven. I was angry. But when I bit into the vegan delight, all my anger subsided. The BEST vegan sausage and vegan cheese I have ever tasted. My husband and I fell in love w the vegan menu and I'm embarrassed to say we went there 4xs in one week. It is that good!!! We picked up the same pizza 2 nights later and then dined in and our waiter was phenomenal. Not like the lady who answers the phones. The vegan starter w veggies and bread was so Delish. I think it was called the Mediterranean Medley. The next time my husband picked up vegan sandwiches and the veggie ball sandwich was out of this world!!! Food is fantastic!!!! Now if they could just give the phone answerer an attitude adjustment, this place would be perfect!!!
