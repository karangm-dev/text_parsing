YES!!!!!  An affordable venue in Las Vegas.  You seriously can't go wrong with pinball games and they offer a wide variety of classic video games from the 80s.  This isn't your new era kind of killing games, which thank the lawd I can't stand those.  There is always onsite staff available if your machine gets jammed.  Ample parking on the side.  You are able to get here via bus.  Open long hours.  Functional restroom.  You a fully all set to play away.  Make sure to bring money cash.  Oh and if you're a germaphobe, bring your sanitizer.  Looking forward to my next Vegas visit.  See you there!
