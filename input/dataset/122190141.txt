Since this was our first time, we started off with Top Dog since it's the starter level one. My husband, two sons and myself had so much fun working together as a team and were able to escape before the time ran out. Our escape master Kenzie was super nice and made it an awesome experience. Definitely recommend it and will be back to do the other rooms!
