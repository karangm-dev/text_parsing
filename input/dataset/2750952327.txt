I feel like Friday's food menu has gotten worse over the years. The alcohol menu - big improvements, I mean, who wouldn't want a 'Diddy Up' - right?!This particular location is hit or miss with the waitstaff - some act like they love their jobs, others look like they hate their lives. Past couple of times I've been there the food came out lukewarm at best. Yesterday, it just so happened that I found a lemon seed in my Brushetta Chicken Pasta, after almost cracking a tooth on it, ew. Although, I will say, I just moved that bad boy to the side and acted like I never saw it. It's probably better that way.The seating arrangements are like any other Friday's... booths, tables, a bar. Some of their 'four person' booths would probably be better suited for 2 people or perhaps small children - you won't find any arm room or a place to set your purse here.Sometimes they run dinner specials - an appetizer, entr√©e, & dessert - somewhere around $11.99 or they've got some 2 for $20 deals.I'll come back but only because it's cheap-ish & close to home.
