We got lucky and a table opened up on a Saturday night. Staff was very down to earth and helpful explaining all of the items on the menu. My wife and I split a salad, and the pork belly appetizer. The appetizer was unreal!  I had the duck and my wife had the shrimp entree. Both amazing. We will definitely be back again soon!  Be sure to make a reservation on weekends. There is a reason they had a write up in the Charlotte magazine....outstanding.
