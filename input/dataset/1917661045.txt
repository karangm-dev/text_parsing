I've come here on previous visits, and was looking forward to the Fire Ball  Wings.  Unfortunately, they are no longer on the menu and were replaced with regular buffalo wings.   They were small and very average.  Providing a tasty dipping sauce with the wings doesn't compensate for small blah wings you could find anywhere.  We went back again 2 days later and tried the Trash Can Nachos.  Ours looked nowhere like the picture and was overloaded with a nasty tasting cheese that overpowered the entire dish.  I never thought I'd use the words 'too much cheese', but this was just nasty.  $20 Nachos should at least taste great. I'll upload a picture of them after posting this review.Onto the good.....We had Spicy Bloody Mary's on both visits.  Worth the $15 price each and huge. It's a little inconsistent on toppings, but nonetheless really good.Service was a little slow on my first visit, but after seeing the Bloody Mary, I understood why It took a little longer, and I was fine with that.The take.......Bring those Fire Ball wings back.  Why would you even take something so good off the menu, only to replace them with something people can get anywhere?Either revisit the Trashcan Nachos recipe, or revisit the staff that are making it.  Who would ever expect Nachos to be bad?  How do you screw that up?  That cheese is pungent nasty.
