Terrible service! Took 2 hrs for a mani & pedi!   Waited in the chair for 15 mins before anyone came over (no water yet to soak in). When finished, sent to a manicure table and waited another 10 mins. I watched customers come and go while I was there. And this salon has 20 pedi chairs and 20 mani stations. Techs more worried about was was going on around them than the customer in front of them. Will never go there again.
