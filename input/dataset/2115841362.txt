The other reviews about not getting your security deposit back are completely true.When I moved in the place was filthy. When I moved out I scrubbed every corner before I left.I got most of my security deposit back but they took out $80 claiming that I didn't clean the toilet or  outside cabinets.  I called three times over two weeks to discuss this with management and she simply would not call me back.Finally I got her email address and then she responded saying that they would not return my money.  This is clearly a tactic of theirs to get extra revenue. To be fair, the staff located at Bear Run are wonderful but the management located elsewhere are not.
