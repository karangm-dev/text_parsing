i did not stay at this hotel but i did visit the hotel and the shops. Beautiful place!!!! not too crowded, very quiet and peaceful... I love this place. This hotel is located on the strip on the north end.. It's less crowded on the north and there is a mall right across the street. This hotel has many high end stores for shopping such as LV, Cartier, etc, but there is a regular mall across the street with Macy's, forever 21, etc..  The gondola rides are nice, but short!! it's 19.95 a person and it's 10mins long. They can stay in doors and out doors with the gondola. I heard out door is better at night because of the lights. Great overall experience, wonderful restaurants, awesome shops..
