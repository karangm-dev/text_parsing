Let me start by saying I grew up in Chicago and love pizza! Make no mistake - this is not Chicago pizza - not NY pizza - but, it is delicious! We tried to pies and could decide which was better! The mushrooms, fennel sausage, flavored onions were a fantastic combo. Prosciutto was also awesome! Wine selection was fair as well.It's a small place and will probably get crowded at night but, in the opinion of a pizza snob - this place ranks high on the must-try list!
