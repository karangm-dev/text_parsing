My Boxer "cousins" Rocky and Bandit Nutter (RIP) come here. Heather (the owner) is super sweet and has experience working in dog boarding facilities. I have experience working in these facilites as well, so I know for a fact that this place is on point! You can monitor your pets online through live cameras and the employees actually care about these "campers". This is the ONLY dog boarding facility that I would ever recommend people to leave their dogs at.
