Wow! We were recommended to go here from Victoria after riding on Slotzilla. When we went upstairs, the space was open and clean with lots of artwork framed everywhere. We were able to use the iPad to help us figure out what the best don't was for our tattoos. The receptionist was helpful in helping us print out multiple sizes to best fit what we wanted. Mark, Ryan, and Bill were available to tattoo the three of us and it was such a smooth process. Lines were clean. Conversation was great.
