Clean place, music , a little loud to sit and have a conversation. Ladies are pretty, service was acceptable, food was okay. Had chicken Caesar salad. Chicken was seasoned with some spice I didn't care for. Salad wasn't as much garlic as I was hoping for. I guess everyone around me this afternoon will appreciate it. Shannon was are server, very pretty, sweet girl. Would I go back? Probably, just not tomorrow.
