I think they changed the owners, new girls, long waits and sloppy workI had an appointment at 12pm and waiting 45mins before I left. Don't except walk ins and have people who made an appointment wait while on lunch. They care more about fast money than being a quality spa. I work down the street and will never return. Instead I'll walk another 5mins to a quality salon.
