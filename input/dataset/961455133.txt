This service experience was so bad, it actually made me join Yelp to warn other people. I took my car in for scheduled maintenance to find out that they charged a minimum of an hours work for a 25 minute job. The service ad visor (Paul) was short and rude on the phone and the Service Manager (Phil) didn't offer anything, even after I told him my hubcaps were installed incorrectly and cracked as a result. To finish off a good day's work, they didn't tighten my oil plug after a routine oil change. Thankfully, I saw the leak so my engine didn't seize up. I would select another Toyota dealer if you have to use one!
