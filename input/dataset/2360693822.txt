Something's going downhill with Rubios. Firstly, the food: their quacamole is nasty. I've been coming to Rubios for over a decade and I've never noticed anything wrong with the guac, but I got a bowl this time and the guac was separated... just foul tasting. Next, the service: As our food was delivered to us the worker asked if there was anything else she could get us. We were seated outside and so I asked for a fork. She told me I could go get it up by the Salsa bar. Why ask me if you know quite well that you're not going to get me anything? I'd rather they just call out a number like other fast food restaurants and I can go get the order and everything else I need. But if they're going to make a play of service and actually bring me the food like they do, would it kill them to bring napkins and a fork too? Otherwise I still have to get up and walk all the way to the front. Their bringing food and nothing else to me does me no good. If you ask me for "anything else," be prepared to follow through or don't ask the question.
