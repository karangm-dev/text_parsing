Came here on The Old Montreal Food Tour from Local Montreal Food Tours (wouldn't recommend). This spot which I was most excited for was the most disappointing. We had poutine and it was soggy, and mine had ton of chicken bones in it. While I get there's chicken in the dish, you'd think the chef could manage to remove the bones? I had two that were over an inch long I had to spit out when it jabbed me as I was chewing.The restaurant is also extremely hot. They had a number of fans going but the heat from the kitchen just infiltrated the whole dining room and was uncomfortable.
