Service sets the tone for a meal! It has been my experience that even when the food is ok, the service can ruin the meal and experience! That being said my coworker and I stopped into Applebee's for the Pick n' Pair lunch special. The hostess sat us at our table with no greeting and lucky for us she was our waitress as well...sarcasm intended and required. She took our drink order walked away several minutes later she returned with our drinks...asked if we knew what we wanted to eat and we placed our ordered. I chose the Fiesta Chicken Chopped salad and new chicken tortilla soup. Now, I don't know how long it takes to put soup in the bowl and throw some salad on a plate but with maybe two other tables occupied and it being late in the afternoon it certainly doesn't take half my lunch hour. And for those of us who try to leave the office for some peace of mind and freedom during the workday...when you are on your lunch hour every moment counts.When our food finally arrived with the few moments we had left on a lunch break. I scarfed it down I think it tasted ok. From what I remember, the salad was spicy and the jalapeno dressing was yummy! The chicken tortilla soup was just ok. It could have used a few more pieces of chicken and spice to take it up a notch. Overall, the experience was horrible. The service was horrible. The food was ok. I won't be running back to this location any time soon.
