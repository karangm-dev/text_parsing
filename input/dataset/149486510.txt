My one star review is based on my experience with reservations.I picked this place because the reviews indicated it was great for accommodating large groups. I called to make a reservation for 10 on the patio and was told it would probably rain on the day I requested, which was weird enough because I had seen a clear forecast.I was assured by the person on the phone that we would be moved outside on the patio, if it didn't rain.I arrived to be told they NEVER take reservations on the patio. This place needs to get their story straight. Luckily we moved next door to the Butler's pantry which was lovely and very accommodating.
