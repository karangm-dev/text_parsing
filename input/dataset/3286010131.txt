This place recently opened and is absolutely amazing! My boyfriend and I booked a one-hour foot massage for $25 each. Not expecting much, we very quite surprised when we were asked to remove jewelry (not on our feet) and jackets. Our feet in a bucket of warm water, we lied down on the comfortable massage beds, and so it began. Not with the feet, but with a face and scalp massage, going to the neck and shoulders, the arms and hands, and then, after the legs, to the feet which received much attention. Then, our therapists worked on our backs, stretching and pressing all the right spots. The room was dark and filled with relaxing music. We were fully clothed the entire time. This was one of the best massages I have ever had! The lady at the front desk was very friendly and professional, and so were the therapists. They know what they are doing! You'll leave relaxed and refreshed. A fantastic experience! We certainly will be back soon.
