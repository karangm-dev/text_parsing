If you never had Bosa Donuts .... you need to like ASAP. Best donuts I had in a while. Cheap too!!! Favorite location is Tempe on mill ave & baseline. Open 24 hours too  Not busy at all and fresh donuts every day I love the dozen donut holes for a Buck & some change. Totally worth the stop if in Tempe.
