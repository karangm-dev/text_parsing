Valet parking review only- OMG YES!When you pull up and you are trying to decide if you should pay the extra to valet? Yes! Do it! 1- If you don't you will find yourself parking lightyears away in a garage that requires maps to get you back to your family!2- And most importantly these guys are hustling like I have never seen before! They are amazing!!! So kind, courteous and professional. Tip- take a pic of your ticket and text them when you need your car, they will then have it ready for you right away when you come downstairs, air on and ready to go. They are amazing- well done Kimpton! ROCKSTARS- all of them!
