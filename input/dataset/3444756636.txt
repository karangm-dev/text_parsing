We were in a hurry and bought prepared food from there Saturday night January 31st. I ate pepperoni pizza and became violently ill. Stomach cramps and then lost everything on Sunday.  I am certain that this is stomach flu not only food poisoning.  I had stomach flu in college.  I know the difference.  Super bowl Sunday was ruined.  I have never eaten their prepared food. I never will eat or shop there at that location.  I am from Austin.  I know and like whole foods,  but this place is terrible.  Dont eat there! Ever!
