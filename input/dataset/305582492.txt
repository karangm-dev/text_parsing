Hopefully if you're reading this, you won't make the same mistake we did and book before reading reviews. We check in and get to our room. We were surprised at how big the room was - we had a double queen + sofa bed. Full fridge, table. Nice size room. And then. We notice the huge cockroach on the curtain. We call the front desk and tell them about the cockroach and the woman's response was "Ewwww" and then proceeded to tell me there was no maintenance on site for someone to take care of it. There were also no more rooms like ours to switch to. And if there's a cockroach in this room, why couldn't there be more in other rooms? We ended up killing the roach ourselves and scouring the room to see if there were anymore. Luckily we didn't see anymore but my skin is crawling just thinking about it. In the small area in from of the elevator, trash was just piled up everywhere and it's clear it hadn't been cleaned in days. No wonder this hotel has bugs. Free WiFi but good luck getting any bars for service. I would not stay here again nor would I recommend this hotel. I have contacted Extended Stay via twitter to put in a complaint and will be contacting Orbitz as well as that is who we booked through. Do yourself a favor and always read reviews prior to booking! The one time we didn't and this is what we get.
