Lexia charged me for everything separate instead of a package meal,  even the sauces and fries,20 wings instead of 24, the manager would not even come out to talk with me, Lorraine. Paid more for a lot less,  went to Pizza Hut for Wing Wednesday to make up for what I was shorted, then accidentally placed a great review for Pizza Hut here, trying to get removed.
