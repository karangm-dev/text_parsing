I have been coming here since 2001 I really really love their breakfast their omelets are pretty big actually enough for 2 people. They have the best crab benedict with hollandaise sauce. They give you a ton of crab meat and it's real crab meat not fake. If you love sandwiches there corned beef is incredible stacked super super high up. This is probably one of my favorite breakfast locations in Vegas I come here probably three to four times a month. If you're in the area definitely stop by and give Bagel Cafe a try.
