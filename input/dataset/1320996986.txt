Fried Chicken Heaven. We have been looking at the reviews for a couple of months.  Wow! Hands down the best fried chicken I have had.  We started with the cheese and charcuterie platter and that would have been enough food for the two of us. It had 3 cheeses a yellow cheddar a white cheddar and a blue cheese with two types of prosciutto and a meat spread.  The blue cheese was a little to serious for me (hints of horse hoof).  Other than that our platter was wonderful.  Our waitress (Lazetta) was very friendly and helpful. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and she was extremely happy.  I tried a bite of the waffle with the bourbon sauce and it was awesome.  I ordered the house chicken with a side of grits. I have never had a better tasting fried chicken in my life. The grits were cooked perfectly and were topped with cheddar cheese.  I liked them but I would have liked them better with a softer whiter cheese.  It is definitely a place that I will return to .
