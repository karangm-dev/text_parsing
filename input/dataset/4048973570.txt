Sams club is Sams club and don't expect the speedy checkout like Costco.  Poor selection of products, Slow customer service, and not to mention about their sluggish check out lines.   Someone needs to motivate the workers with higher pay and better system.  Feels like a turkey farm here....if Costco is nearby, Sams club is out of the question...
