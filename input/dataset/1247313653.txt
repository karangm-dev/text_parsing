Before I get into the food, the atmosphere is the first thing that catches your eye obviously. It's set up like a cross between a 50's diner and a casino lounge. The waitresses are dressed the part, too. My wife and I got there on a Monday morning around 10 and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a booth. And the food... restaurants always claim to have "huge portions." This place lives up to reputation. I ordered a veggie omelet, and was worried it wouldn't be enough food so I added cheese and also planned on splitting my wife's side of Canadian bacon. But then the food arrived. The omelet was enormous. I asked the waitress how many eggs, because most places make their omelets with three eggs. No, Peppermill makes theirs with ten. Yes, ten eggs. And it wasn't just a ridiculous quantity; the quality was good, too. Another bonus is the wife and I were both able to sub fruit instead of potatoes at no charge. And while the side of fruit wasn't nearly as big as the enormously sized fruit plate, it was still a lot. And freshly cut. Lastly, as if to cement the meal as great even more, my wife's eggs were perfectly poached to her liking. When we come back to Vegas, we will definitely go out of our way to stop here a
