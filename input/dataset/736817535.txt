I went last night for the first time with my boyfriend .  We ordered the Mexican pizza which was amazing! The food was pretty good, and was not too expensive.  The music was ridiculously loud and couldn't even hear our waitress or talk to each other...was so bad we had to ask the waitress to turn it down slightly. Service was probably the worst service I've ever had in my life, and my boyfriend also agrees.  Extremely slow, and waited forever for our food, bill, and drinks.  We had to continuously ask the waitress for more drinks. She also came around once in a blue moon.  The restaurant was too busy at all..possibly 10 tables there, and only one waitress working.  They definitely need to hire more servers...service was the worst I have ever seen.
