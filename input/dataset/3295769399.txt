Feeling so sad and disappointed.  Been so happy eating here until today.  Ordered a pie with sausage, a salad, two orders of garlic knots.  After we place our whole order the girl tells us it's a 45 minute wait for the pizza!!!!!!  Why not let us know in the beginning.  She said they have individual slices available.....I had my hungry husband and kids with me so we settled for the slices which costs us much more than buying the pie.  Felt ripped off.  Also the pizza was not really hot.  Don't know if I'll  be back.
