These stars are for cleanliness and for OK taste. Zero stars for customer service. I walked in happy with my small talk, the lady in charge wasn't understanding a word I was saying, then she asked what I was looking for. Then I asked is that was a restaurant, she said yes, and I told her: "OK, then I'm looking for food." I was about to leave based on her rude gestures, but I was hungry. Throughout my meal I completely stayed quiet, so she kind of toned it down a bit. Maybe it's a cultural thing, who knows. Some people are always on the defensive. I stayed, I tasted and that's my rating.
