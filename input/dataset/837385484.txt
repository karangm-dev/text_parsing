Great breakfast spot! Love that they advertise their use of cooking with cage free eggs and real butter and evoo. Makes the quality of food that much better! Came on a Saturday morning around 10 and with a party of 6 I expected there to be a decent wait but within minutes we were seated! Guy working at the front was awesome, very friendly and efficient! Our waitress was just okay but the food was great!! Hubby got the waffles and they were honestly phenomenal. And as for the bacon, I cannot wait to go back and get some more! Bacon was out of this world. Great food at decent prices, I'll definitely be back!
