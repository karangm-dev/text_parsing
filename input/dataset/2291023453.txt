I just purchased a new home that needs to have the wrought iron fence repaired.  I called and spoke with Monica after filling out their information form on-line.  Monica scheduled to have Angel come out to give me an estimate.  Angel was a no-show.  Had to call back into the office the next day.  Monica made arrangements to have Angel come back out that night.  I couldn't be there and had Angel meet and speak with my dad since he knew what I was wanting.  Angel told him that repairs could be made and called me after this meeting.  I then proceeded to call the office 2 days later (which was a Friday) and spoke with Monica.  She made arrangements to have Angel come out the following Monday to do the written estimates.  The appointment was for 5pm as was the 1st appointment that Angel no showed.  Again, Angel was a no show.  I was home until 5:40pm.  Angel then proceeded to call me at 6:30pm after I had left to run errands to tell me he was there at my place and would start measuring for my replacement.  THIS is NOT what was discussed.  Repairs are much different than replacement.  Also, what the heck happened to my 5pm appointment??  He told me that he was across town working on another project.  And, was told by Monica to by at my place between 5-6pm.  So, he couldn't call me to let me know he was running behind??? 5-6pm is not 6:30.  This is not the arrangement that I made and was told by Monica my appointment time was at 5pm.  Monica proceeded to call me the next day to ask for my e-mail address - which I already had to give when filling out their on-line information - so she could send over my estimate.  I'm still waiting on that.  I will be going to go with another company.  If this company's idea of customer service is any indication of the work they do --- consumer be warned!!!!!
