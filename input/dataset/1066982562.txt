This facility egregious acts has allowed my sister to get enormous painful open wounds on her back, buttock, and the heels of her feet. She's been left lying in her own waste / urine for hours... Refusing to sit her up in a chair, never taken outside to breathe fresh air and get sunlight because she can't walk. Atrociously over medicating my sister like a zombie after the family addressed the atrocious acts of "Abuse / Neglect after  leaving her wet from neck to feet for hours after calling for assistance. Extremely long wait before nurses to respond.No Occupational therapy because she has to be hoisted up with 2 staff, but this is not a reason not to give her good care. My sister is a human being and our Loved One!!!If you have a family member who is unable to walked you must visit daily and advocate for them... Please Help the Helpless!
