I've worked with Active Renter since 2011.  I've referred several of my investor clients to Rich.  As a residential realtor, its very important that my clients have a great experince with their investment property, as I rely on them for repeat business (home sales).  Each and every one of my referred clients have been thrilled with the service they receive from Active Renter.  Their fees are typical for the industry, and their customer service is top-notch.  When my clients are ready to sell, Rich refers them back to me for the listing.  He also notifies me of any off-market deals so I can give my investors as opportunity to buy their next rental at a discount.In addition to referring my investor clients to Active Renter, they also manage my personal rental on 15th Ave and Northern.  They do a phenomenal job. They found me a great tenant, who takes immaculate care of the property.  The home was built in the 1960s, so it has the typical problems you would expect with an older home.  Active Renter does a good job of responding to my tenants maintenance calls while still keeping my repair costs down.  My tenant is ready to renew their lease for a third year, which really helps my cash-flow.  My tenants have even asked if they can purchase the property.  Unfortunately, with a good property manager in place and a great tenant... the property is too profitable of an investment for me to sell.
