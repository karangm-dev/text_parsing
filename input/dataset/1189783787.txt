After reading the reviews here, I was truly stressed because I had already reserved a car and knew a refund wasn't an option.   I arrived on a Saturday about 10:00 AM.  I was the only one in line and there were 4 or 5 employees ready to help.  The employee who assisted me was friendly and helpful.  Yes, he asked me about the extra insurance but when I declined, that was it...no high pressure, no attitude...nothing.  I was in and out in 5 minutes.  I wasn't charged anything extra that shouldn't have been on my bill...easy peasy.  I received the car class I reserved and the car was very clean.  I wanted to let people know that they shouldn't base their decision solely on the negative reviews posted here!  BTW..I bid $8.00 daily on priceline and my bid was accepted!
