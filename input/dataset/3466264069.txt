I've always seen this place when I visit Ross or Target, but have never visited until recently. It's great! The layout is similar to Marshalls, maybe it's the same company? The store is clean and tidy and the associates have been friendly and helpful. It's priced similarly to Ross and they have similar items as Marshalls. They're also the only store nearby that sells 94" curtains.
