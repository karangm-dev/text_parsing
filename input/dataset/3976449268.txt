The name truly does justice to its cuisine. Ordered the spicy peanut curry (with tofu) along with a coconut ice cream, and both did not fail to impress with regards to the quality as well as the quanitity offered. I requested the curry to be extra spicy, which blended well with the flavour and taste and was not just a spicy dish filled with chillies. After savouring this dish, I had no room left for a second offering so chose to opt for the ice cream instead. The ice cream had a nice tinge of coconut to it and was not heavy on the cream/milk making it a good palate cleanser. In addition to this, the decor and friendly employees force me to visit again to try out yet another spicy curry!
