Reliable, affordable courteous and knowledgeable. Tereza and Ales go above and beyond in service and standards. This company cares for you and your car. Taking the time to correctly diagnose my car and saving me hundreds if not thousands of dollars in fake repairs. I highly recommend them. You won't be disappointed.
