One star for this place.  The receptionist is rude, unprofessional and has little knowledge of the products and what they carry.  Not exactly the person you want as the first point of contact with your customers.   When I arrived I walked in with my son who was clearly visible, (there's a reason for this detail).  Anyway, I told  the receptionist I had called an hour earlier and would like to see the Carrara marble.  She asked me if I had anyone with me when clearly she could see my son.  She then told me my son would not be permitted in the warehouse.  So needless to say we won't be doing business with these people.  Too bad for them as we needed at least two slabs for our current project.  We are headed over to Dente Marble where my son is welcome in the warehouse and their staff is knowledgeable and pleasant to deal with.
