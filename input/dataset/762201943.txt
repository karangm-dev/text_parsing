I stopped with a friend remembering how delicious it was when the owner was Italian. He served the best zucchini cakes in the city. His marinara was incredible. Every thing he served was a work of art. He was from Italy. The new owners told me Frank was no longer cooking. Needless to say, the food was less than mediocre. A step above eat& park, but way more expensive. The clencher was the white sliced bread with sprinkled garlic salt. The pasta was overlooked. Two dinners thirty seven fifty, on paper plates and napkins used at a picnic.l hate wasting money on BAD FOOD.
