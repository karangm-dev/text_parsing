ALICE was awesome at helping my niece pick the dress of her dreams. We walked in looking for a vail because my niece was going to use my mom's wedding dress. With the help of Alice, my niece tried on about 5 dresses and with her listening skills, my niece found the dress!!! Alice was super nice, helpful, and awesome!
