The store has a nice men's department downstairs.     The sale items are all the way in the back near the dressing rooms, check it out for great deals....The salespeople are friendly and helpful.    This store has a great coffee shop right by the men's department...where you can get a drink and a pastry.   Comfy seating makes it for a great little coffee spot.Club Monaco is a bit on the pricey side, but I usually find great sales that are a great value..
