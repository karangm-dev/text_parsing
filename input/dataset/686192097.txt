A fun atmosphere and cheerful, attentive service, but holy cow, the SALT!!!!!  I ordered the eggplant parmigiana and it was so insanely loaded with salt, it was quite literally inedible.  The server was good about removing it from the bill, and I hope the kitchen was advised of the issue.Seriously, it was as if the salt shaker had dropped into the pot of sauce, and they just shrugged and served it anyway. My companion tasted it, and agreed...so it wasn't just me!
