OMG - they just drop it off in the middle of a two-car driveway and run away (it's 7 ft wide).  No calls, no knock on the door.  I thought they were a no show until I went outside just now.  Cannot reach their local office either.  All numbers go to Florida (and they have about 3 different ones).  AND with IRMA/State of Emergency I am s#!^ out of luck. I will upgrade this to 3 stars if I can get them to come back and move the POD over or take it away.
