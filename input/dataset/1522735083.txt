Ordered basic Cheeseburger today and added a fried egg.  The sunny side up egg arrived on my burger still "jiggly" with translucent white areas.  It looked very unappetizing so I scrapped it off and ate the rest of the mediocre burger.  The fries were only mediocre as well.  Nothing spectacular at all about my lunch today with the exception of the waitress who was on point.  This place should be full at lunch...  I think the food is the reason why there's no wait  :-(
