I'll start by saying that I've never posted a negative online review in my life but the Range at Lake Norman has motivated me to change this habit.I'm a member who has been treated so shabbily, that with 6-months left on my prepaid one-year membership, I will never return.I could write an entire essay on the situation but just know that there is a customer service problem in terms of staff, and that the issue goes all the way to the top. I would recommend that you NOT make a membership commitment to this business. Based on my experience you will not be treated well and when you have an issue, they will ignore your reasonable request to make it right.If you stop in off the street, rent a shooting lane and have a bad experience, you can simply not return and you suffer no financial penalty. When you're a member you are stuck. In my case the ownership would not so much as reply to my respectful request for a pro-rated refund based a very negative membership experience.Its really too bad that they built a beautiful facility but don't have the commitment to a  basic level of customer service that would make it a really enjoyable place to shoot.
