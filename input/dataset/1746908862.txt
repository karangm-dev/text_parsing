This chain is taking old hotels and upgrading with some new furniture.  Meh.  The beds were comfortable and clean.  The place was quiet.  The breakfast was OK - rubbery eggs and cold sausage and those ubiquitous waffles.  But the dining area was dirty.  The carpets were worn.  The air conditioner flaked out and needed batteries.  The pool was closed although the hotel offered a shuttle to another hotel (are you kidding?  in 120 heat?)  Could not get hot water in the shower and was told "It's Phoenix.  No one takes hot showers."   The insult comes at the end when they add $5 for "service" -- the water when you arrive, cookies, paper, internet, breakfast -- all the things they advertise as amenities.  Oh, it's a bad neighborhood with drug dealers and street walkers.  OK for a night's stay if you have no time to look, but not the best.
