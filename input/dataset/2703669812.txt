I came here for the first time today, which is silly because I live so close. This place was a dream for me. I'm a vegetarian and my options for good veggie food in Phoenix are so limited. I had the jackfruit bbq sandwich and it was awesome. More food than I could even eat. Plus they sell cold brew in sizes up to 32oz! Perfect. The girl working was so nice. I'll definitely be a regular here now that I know what it's all about
