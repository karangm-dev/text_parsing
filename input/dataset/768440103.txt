I would suggest you to not go here first I went with a friend of mine to get acrylic full sets and when I was getting my nails done the lady kept on filing my nails and she was so rough and started filing a little bit of my skin and it hurt and I said ouch and pulled my hand back multiple times and she still kept doing it and me and my friend got the same exact thing done but they charged her 5 dollars more but I will not be going back
