Nothing but rave reviews for Dan and his team at Vivid Racing. They have always provided excellent customer service and their products are amazing! I've purchased a VR flash tune, RSR Coil springs, and a set of Work Wheels, and I can't get enough of their stuff!! I want more!!! I've dealt with many of their staff and they have always been very professional with the way they conduct their business, no games no gimmicks always straight up and honest. I only wish they were in Los Angeles so I can take my car to their shop and get more car candy for my vehicle! I hope you all contact Dan and his team at Vivid Racing to get quotes for all your aftermarket and OEM car part needs and compare pricing. They are hard to beat! They make me feel like I am their number one priority and that is hard to find!
