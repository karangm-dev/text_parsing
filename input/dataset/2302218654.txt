Located next to the Costco near Woodbine & Hwy 7.  Looks like lots of people go for dim sum and grocery shopping without having to move the car.  However, unless you take advantage of their early bird pricing (we did not), not that great a place for dim sum...better quality/price choices are readily available.  Our party of four paid $57 all in for 8 so-so dim sum dishes plus a noodle plate.
