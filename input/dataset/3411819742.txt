Got some coffee on a very busy day. Line out the door. I was looking for some honey to put in my joe and they didn't have any out front in the lobby. Roland (employee) asked what I was looking for and said they had some in the back but I said I was ok. Without me knowing he went in the back, got a to-go container of coffee and tracked me down on the street to give it to me. Will definitely give them my business next time in town. Roland is the man!
