So...I sent my son to WalMart for his eye exam and gave him a contact prescription for me to fill.  He called me from WalMart and asked "What color of contacts did you want mom?  Blue please....thanx Mom, that's what I thought you wanted. I got the contacts Saturday and they are the wrong TYPE...there are color blend and color changing.  They never asked my son which type...they ASSUMED - I tried to return them, and they said it was my sons fault!  I asked and he said they never asked him what TYPE, only what color.  Now they won't take the contacts back - they say it's HIS FAULT?  WHAT??????  You're the professionals - you did not ask the correct / all questions.  Now I'm stuck with over $100 worth of contacts that I didn't order.  Seriously?  WalMart didn't ask all the questions and they certainly are not acting like professionals.DO NOT GO TO THIS WALMART - THEY ARE IDIOTS!
