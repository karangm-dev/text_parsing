Had gone within the past few weeks for an all you can eat benefit, over 100 people.  They would bring out a 1/2 sheet pizza at a time, maybe 50 wings and that would be it for over half an hour. Beer and soda was included, you would have to find a server and they were rude. If you went to the bar for a refill you were told to find a server. Also there ice tasted like they have well water. All in all not good!
