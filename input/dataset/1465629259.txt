I frequent many Ten Ren locations in LA (I was here in town visiting family) and this one missed the mark on so many points. The minced pork on rice barely had any pork on it and there wasnt enough sauce to use over the rice.My hot milk tea was also very watered down and there was no tea flavor.Location looks clean and new at least and tends to be very popular amongst teens and young adults.
