This is the worst restaurant I ever ever been in my life. We felt like a DOG or wild. We received our food in a nasty plastic bag as plate with no fork, nothing just like a dog eating his food. Food is not very good I even couldn't eat it I was sick feeling humillated, offended. I am wondering if the city knows the way they serve the food in a unhealthy plastic bag!!
