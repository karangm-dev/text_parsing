Selection was slim based on what I'm used to. Also they have lockers at the front, where they demand you lock up your bags. Makes you feel like a child. Also, the customer service left something to be desired. I asked the woman at the front of the store, how many bags of hair would I need for braids. She states, "I don't know why you people ask me how many bags you need. You guys are the one who get braids!" Ummmm...excuse me..."you people?" [For reference, I am Black, she was Asian]. Well, I'm probably just asking you because you work in a hair store all day! Needless to say, I will not be back to this store, ever.
