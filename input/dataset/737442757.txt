Went there this weekend with my husband. You tell them your problem before being processed.Dr. Zima Pakzad did absolutely nothing to help him. She said that they did not have blood testing or any other type of testing he needed. An Urgent Care that gives NO CARE??? Do not go! They will take your urgent care co -pay (in our situation $150) for nothing. She told him to go to the hospital. So, I asked for the $150 back so that we could go somewhere that COULD help, she refused and then said " I am talking to him..." WTF?? How is talking to him going to help his medical problem. The place was dirty. Blood on the floor in the waiting room, right next to couch. Staff was very unprofessional (except for one lady) and they sat around and discussed their personal lives the entire time. They office staff even had bad appearance. It looked like 80% of them rolled out of bed and came in. The doctor gave a prescription for an over the counter medication, without even figuring out what his problem was... what a crock! Don't waste your time here. They don't help.
