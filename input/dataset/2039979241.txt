This place is a joke. I don't know how they operate. The manager won't ever speak to you even when you call to complain. News flash there is nothing honest about running your company this way. The first occurrence is when the sales lady convinced me to buy this Camo Queen lotion. I started going here on the 2nd and I've only been twice because it's one screw up after another. The lotion turned  my hands, inside my fingers and even under my jawline Orange. When I called I was told a manger would call me back. Never happened. I got a call from an employee that nothing but a discount on a new lotion could be given. I went back again on Friday to make use of the 30 day membership and the lady supposedly put me in for 8 minutes (I had done 6 the first time). Side note: The place is filthy and the employees are unprofessional. I closed my eyes in the stand up and rotated occasionally. About two hours later I started to feel very warm. Checked under my clothes and my skin wasn't even red it was purple. PURPLE. I spent the whole weekend in agonizing pain and went to the doctor and got diagnosed with 2nd degree burns. I called the place to complain and no ones called me back. I called again to cancel the membership and they told me I have to come in. This place is unprofessional, dirty and a scam. Don't waste your time or money.
