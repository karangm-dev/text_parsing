My consultants were Sam and Lea. They both did an outstanding job. I was running late to the appointment be was help prompted. I was looking for a dress for a cocktail reception and something I could wear to a ball I having later this year. Lea, walked me to the special occasions area where we picked out multiple dresses to try on. I found one that was beautiful but they didn't give me the wow factor I was looking for. Sam came in immediately told me about new arrival they had gotten but no one has wore because it just came off the shipment truck. I must say I wasn't sure at first but when I turned around and saw myself in the mirror I just KNEW that was the dress!!! I have never felt more beautiful. The dress is absolutely gorgeous! A state piece with timeless and endless beauty feeling to it; exactly what I was aiming for!!!!! I am so excited! Even my friends were like "Wow!" Lea and Sam ensured I had all the necessary accessories for the right fit and storage of the dress. Three more weeks until my event and I can't wait. As promised I will be returning to show pictures. Thank you so much Sam and Lea!!! I will returning if I need anything in the future!
