We went for breakfast yesterday.  There was 4 of us and they offer 4 different vegan breakfast choices so we ordered one of each,  We often employ this strategy so we can try different things. The place seems borderline cheesy to me.  The service was over the top good but the quality of food and coffee not so much.  Of everything we tried the French Toast was the best of the lot!  They had some sort of sweet potato hash brown that was undercooked and the coffee was on par with the quality of a convenience store.  Bottom line - gimmicky place with good service, below average food and lousy coffee.  I will not be returning any time soon.
