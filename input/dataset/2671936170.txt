Fat Ox is perfect! The restaurant is beautifully laid out with the floor-to-ceiling windows and the large, well-displayed bar. The servers are extremely knowledgeable and professional. The prices are high, but worth it. They served the best scallops I have EVER eaten. And their sign by the bathroom of "men to the left, because women are always right" put a huge smile on my face.  :)  Two thumbs up!
