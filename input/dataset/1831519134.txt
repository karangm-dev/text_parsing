Came for the cats, stayed for the food. It is really amusing to see them walking all over the place. A little bit on the pricey side but I think it's worth it for the whole experience.Ordered a sandwich and it came with a nice salad on the side, so its a nice way to try the both of them. I definitely recomend it and would come back again.
