Avoid this place at all costs. Most unprofessional rude people I have ever encountered. I was in an accident and the night of the accident I gave the highway patrol officer my key and he gave it to the tow driver. The guy at the tow office told me that the key was in my cup holder, when I went out to the car it was nowhere to be found. He told me to speak with Kevin so I did and he was a complete douchebag and refused to pay for my key that they lost, said the highway patrol officer "never gave him the key" Horrible place, horrible people do yourself a favor and choose any other towing company
