Horrible service-weird lady (wendy?).  Laughed when I told her she was rude.  They came out to give a quote on my fountain-wanted to charge $250 for a quote (you can use it for the work).  Didn't show up when they were booked.  Walked into my courtyard without ringing the bell or announcing themselves.  Overall, all staff I dealt with was unprofessional.
