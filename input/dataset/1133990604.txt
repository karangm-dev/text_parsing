Went here a few months ago for first time for work event and it was awesome. Defiantly nothing like a regular driving range at a golf course. Awesome atmosphere and great music playing. Will be going back for sure. Highly recommended even if you don't know how to golf or never really golf no matter how bad you think you may be you'll have a blast. **Note- you don't need to take golf clubs they will provide for you, lefty or righty they have both. If you take your own you can only take irons. Can't take your own drivers or hybrids, which was a little bummer but guess you have to keep playing field even I suppose. Still give five stars for sure
