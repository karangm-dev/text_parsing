I originally booked this because of their lower rates for a "compact" car, which is their lowest priced offering.  When I got to the counter at the airport, they were going to put me in a Volkswagen Bug. I declined this, and moved up to a "mid-sized" car....I ended up with a Toyota Corolla.  However, they charged me $18 more per day,  plus a whole list of other charges - this is directly from my receipt:  11% Fee, Customer Facility Charge ($6/day), MTNC Facility Fee ($1/day) & Energy Recovery fee (.60 cents/day). And then, on top of all of this, I got hit with tax and a county surcharge.  I paid $87 more (total) on top of my basic rate of $62/day (3 days), which brings my total bill to $91/day.  So, I really didn't pay that much less than if I'd gone to a better known brand, and they were a hassle from the very start (tried to up sell me on EVERYTHING, and I watched very closely that they didn't slip something onto the agreement). I probably will not use them again, if I can help it.
