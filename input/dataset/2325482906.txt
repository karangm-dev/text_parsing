Awesome spot. Their sheesha is probably the best in Mississauga because they actually take the time to clean the sheesha's unlike many other spots. The water is always clean and you never hey any filth coming out of the pipes (that's the worst). I have been a regular customer for quite some time now and this has become my new favourite spot. The customer service is always great, the environment is relaxing and the food is delicious.
