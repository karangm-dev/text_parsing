The Thumb was recommended by a local for breakfast or lunch and we were really happy we stopped in.  My daughter had the pulled pork sandwich with vinegar slaw and baked Mac. The pork was tender, juicy and great smoke flavor. Mac was delicious and the slaw was perfect for the sandwich side. My wife had the smoked chicken and it was amazing. Juicy, fall apart perfection with enough smoke flavor to compliment, not overpower the chicken flavor. Her cornbread was homemade and the baked beans were sweet and rich. The star of the show was the Brisket Stack. Tender, juicy lean brisket with a gorgeous smoke ring, over homemade hash browns topped with 2 fried eggs and a chili aolli. Bring your appetite because this thing is one of the best bbq combos I have ever had. The multiple dining areas are very nice and clean and the folks here are very friendly. On top of all that, you can fill up your car, get it washed and detailed, get baked goods, beer, wine and chatchkies out the wazoo.  The Thumb is absolutely one of kind and worth the trip. If we come back to Scottsdale, it will be on our places to visit again.
