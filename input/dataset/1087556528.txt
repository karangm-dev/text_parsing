This is the worse service ive ever had to deal with. It wasnt busy AT ALL!!!!! It was almost good until we ordered our food. Once the food got there we had to wait like 5 minutes to eat because Priscilla forgot to bring us our damn utensils  I ordered a mango and lemonade drink that was not good/sweet at all. She didnt bring us refills for water and as soon as we were done eating she seemed to kinda rush us out by bringing the bill, but we wanted dessert so we ordered and ice cream after waiting 10 mins for her to come back to the table. After we ate our sundaes she didnt bring us the new receipt with the new orders on it. And while we were waiting for that she sat down a whole different group and we overheard her making the same mistakes to the next people. We got tired of waiting so we used the receipt she first gave us, while we were checking out i guess she was clocking out and left the new guy that didnt know how to work the system split our bills
