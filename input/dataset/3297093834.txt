Life Smiles is a very convenient place for me, but I also came because they have received multiple good reviews and now I know for myself why! From the moment I walked into this office everything and everyone was beyond nice. I have always been afraid of the dentist, and this was one of the first times i have felt comfortable and happy on that chair. I got THE best teeth cleaning dentist, her name was Kelly. I recommend everyone requesting for her because she takes care of your problems, talks you through them, and makes you feel like she's just your friend! So, I'm definitely coming back to this place!!!
