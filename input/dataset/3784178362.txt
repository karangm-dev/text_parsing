Delicious! Have been here several times and now love bringing family and friends when they are in town. It's where my boyfriend and I had our first date and we tend to revisit often. The food is perfect, we've never had a dish that is less than wonderful. The beer and cocktail selection is plentiful. The environment is laid back and cozy, with servers that have been wonderful every time.
