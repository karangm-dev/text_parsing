This place blew junks tonight. Take out order wasn't ready because "we ran out of chicken ",  missed completely two ordered items which we didn't know until home. Don't go there. Not going back.Upon review of other commenters on Yelp, my experience last night at Pita Jungle was not unique. Not going back.
