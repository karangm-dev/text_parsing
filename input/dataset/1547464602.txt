Wowza.  I don't know how good the tacos were.  I ate several of the carne asada and the carnitas tacos, so I'm sure they were good.  I mainly used the tacos as a means to transport the absolutely amazing condiments to my mouth.  Tacos Chiwas has a large case of different types of salsa and veggies to add to your tacos.  There is a light green salsa that tastes like buttermilk and cilantro.  It's probably not actually made of buttermilk and cilantro, but it's incredible, and I drenched all my food in it.  I also drank it straight from the provided cup and made "tacos" out of cucumbers with grilled onions inside and covered in the buttermilk/cilantro sauce.All in all, this is probably my favorite new taco place in Phoenix.
