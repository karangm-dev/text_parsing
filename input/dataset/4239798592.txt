Toby Keith I Love This Bar & Grill... Ha!  Ridiculous!!! We walked two miles down the strip to get here. We expected country music (perhaps our mistake?? Toby meets Vegas... No thanks!!!) but we got pop music and a bartender that spent more time throwing the bottles around (attempting to look cool) then actually pouring and serving drinks. We're from San Diego and we have some great (country) bars there... This was so far from what we expected. Booooo!
