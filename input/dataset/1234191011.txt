I've never experienced discrimination as I did last night at this place. I was with 2 other females...we had on dresses and heels. The place was very diverse as far as how everyone was dressed. Dresses, heels, jeans, flip flops, shorts, etc. Immediately we noticed large groups of people of a particular race coming from the back of the line and going inside. We thought nothing of it...assumed they were all on lists. Then it just got weird. We noticed the guy working the door was walking back and fourth scanning the line for people he would pull out and let go inside. Every time it just happened to be groups with Caucasian people. 4 Caucasian girls were in front of us and behind a group of 4 black males. The girls were pulled out of the line and taken to the door to go inside, no talk of any lists. The guys were told they must be on a list or leave. The guys left. We watched this happen quite a few more times before we just gave up here and removed ourselves from the line. We were standing in the front for a really long time with no acknowledgement from the guy working the door. Funny thing is he didn't make a big announcement that we must be on a list to get inside. He was walking up to particular groups and telling them in a low tone so they would leave. I know it wasn't because of how we were dressed or looked....they were letting people in with jeans and flip flops. Ultimately we were let in by a bouncer at a side door. There was nothing so special going on in there that they had to be "picky" about who they let inside. It was like a night at Suite.  Safe to say, I will never step foot in this place again.
