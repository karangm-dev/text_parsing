This is my new favorite at the lake. Good menu and great service. Emily is the best! The French dip is the best I have ever had!  I have been here 8 times since it opened ( less than two miles from home!). Everything I have had has been excellent.  Try the Oreo Ice Cream Sandwich for dessert. You will not be disappointed.
