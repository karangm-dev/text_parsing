Hello? Umm Hhelllow? Person here ready to pay. Waited at cashier for close to 5 minutes for 2 lousy buns, there were almost nobody at the bakery at the time , i guess the empoyees decided to go play hide & seek. Finally paid my buns looked fresh was still warm and soft so far so good, took a bite into my bbq pork bun or supposedly , umm hello? Taste and stuffing where are thou? Like Target this place does nothing for me.
