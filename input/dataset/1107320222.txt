Shrimp Risotto was terrible...all I could taste was salt like I was eating a microwave dinner- it was definitely NOT fresh which you would expect at these prices. All the waiters but one treated you like you were at a food-truck. Their demeanour is like they don't care about you and they're just doing their job. I will not be returning.
