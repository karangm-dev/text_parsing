The three guys that they sent out took about two hours to empty my house, and about 1 1/2 to move my stuff into my new house.  Very professional the entire time, personable, and they took impeccable care of my stuff, nothing was damaged, they wrapped each piece of furniture with pads or plastic.  Under $800 for the move, and it was so great to not have to do it myself. I would recommend them to anyone.
