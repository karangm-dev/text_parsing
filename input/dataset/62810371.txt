A first rate way to spend an afternoon with the family.  This zoo is run entirely through endowment funds, and is free to the public--though donations are appreciated.  Great exhibits, with new ones being added.  The surrounding park and arboretum are beautiful.  Bring a cooler and a grill and make a full day of it!
