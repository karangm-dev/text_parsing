From what I can tell this will be Joe's Audio's first review. I don't understand how that could be. His business seems like it's been in the same place for a few years now but I think after doing business with him he's just too nice of a guy and doesn't market himself aggressively.I found him on Craigslist and to be honest I was apprehensive because the auto services part of CL can be a little shady. My primary motive for using him was he was fairly priced and he was close. I had many other quotes but he was the lowest. The others that were close to matching his price were located on the other side of the valley so the drive and gas kind of ate up what ever little profit margin there was gong to be.I had just bought a new used Tundra. The stereo was stock but I was looking to upgrade to a touchscreen with a few extras. I wanted a rear view camera, my steering wheel controls and a Mira box installed that allowed me mirror my cell phone onto the touch screen. I don't know a lot about installing stereos but I thought it was going to take a lot of time to do everything I asked...and it did. It took Joe about 5 to 6 hours. Once the job was done, it exceeded my expectations. The stereo looked great, the rear camera worked well and the steering wheel controls responded like they should. We were kind of fumbling through the Mira box but it was more the fact we hadn't read the instructions and not because it was installed incorrectly. The best part of the experience was Joe. He responded quickly to my phone calls, emails and texts. He was even kind enough to provide a part I had forgotten at his cost. He showed me the receipt. I had a very positive experience with him and would recommend him to anyone that was looking for a stereo install. He's extremely reasonably priced and a nice guy to work with.
