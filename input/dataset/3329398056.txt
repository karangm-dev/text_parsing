Awful! We were here for nearly hours due to slow service, several orders of cold fries, drink mix ups, and waiting 45 minutes for our check. Waitress said fries didn't come with our meals so we ordered extras. Turns out every meal came with fries. It was a huge mess. Had to go out of our way to confront the manager by the end of it because it seemed she purposely avoided our table. Will not be back
