Just another strip mall sushi place. Kind of run down looking inside and out. Sushi was on par with that from your grocery store but higher priced. Wait staff was horrible! Our waitress sat next to us and erased used menus and wore a t-shirt two sizes to small, exposing her butt cleavage. I regret not going to my regular sushi place. Either those who have reviewed this either haven't had real sushi or the business is writing their own reviews. I was not impressed and will not be returning.
