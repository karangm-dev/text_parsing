Me and my wife go there every Saturday and we always have the same waitress. Food is great and the staff is very friendly. We usually get the just about the same thing every week so they know what we want. By the time we sit down w/in about 10 mins our food is out. When your there ask for Ashley b/c she takes care of us and is the best waitress they have over there and friendly as well.
