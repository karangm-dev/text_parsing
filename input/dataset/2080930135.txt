My husband and I visited the Arizona Science Center two weeks ago on a Saturday to use a Groupon for the DaVinci exhibit. We like museums. So why only two stars? Parking was confusing. Apparently you can get parking validated if you park in a specific lot, but there weren't signs or directions to let us know that. We parked across the street next to the Diamondbacks stadium for not an obscene amount of money, but considering we are in Phoenix and not San Francisco, it was excessive. Plus there was some other event going on so we had to drive up several floors and there were annoying cones blocking off most of the available parking. WTF! Then we got to the lobby. The line was waaayyyy worse than the MVD. And the lobby is also pure concrete (think bomb shelter), so if you're trying to pull up a Groupon or something on your phone... give up. The cashier was kind enough to pull up our Groupons on her computer. The line was also complete with more than its fair share of impatient, screaming children who needed their naps. The actual exhibit was interesting. The only way to get from the ticket counter to the exhibit was a small, slow, in-the-corner elevator. We looked through a few of the permanent exhibits, and it was ok, but nothing special.
