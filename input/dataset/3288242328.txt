The worst salon experience ever!! They speak loudly non stop in Hebrew not egnlish , screaming over your head, especially Maria.. If you are not part of it you get really second class treatment.When Maria (who probably not even  experienced, "combed" my hair she was litterely terried them apart) Never on time, my appointment for coloring roots (no style) 11 am. left salon at 2.30. The product was not the same as was discussed over the phone, as a resoult dull hair. Went outside with wet hair, they did not offer to dry my hair. Terrible!!!
