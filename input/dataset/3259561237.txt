My wife loves this place and give it 2 enthusiastic thumbs up and loves ordering lunch online for pick-up. While I understand that's very convenient for a busy elementary school teacher, I just don't get what she sees in it beyond that. It's a convenient location, although the parking lot is inadequate at peak hours due to the dead-end drive thru. The interior is very neat with all the wood trim. The employees were very nice and helpful. But that's about it for the Pros. If the food were better, I would have no problem giving it 5 stars. It's not horrible food, but The Perfect Pear is far superior. it's just basic food, dressed up in a really nice setting. I got their signature dish - Croque Monsier.  First time to a restaurant, I always try to get a dish it's famous for. I really didn't see what the big deal was. It's basically a Monte-Cristo-type warm sandwich, no different than Chompies. My big complaint is when restaurants make these ''elite' sandwiches and the insides (meat, cheese, etc) are a big lump in the middle and the rest of the sandwich is plain bread because they couldn't take the time to actually spread out the ingredients so you'd get a good bite every time. The second big issue is since it's warm/heated, as it sits on the plate, the bottom can get soggy. Mine must have been sitting for a while because the bottom of the bread was mushy. Yuck. So their 'signature dish' was fairly tasteless, I had to spread the insides around with my finger, and it was soggy on the bottom. Triple Yuck. The pasta salad side was really good but the meal was already on the downside by that time. Or course I have a very small sample size of one visit and one dish, but it WAS a signature dish. Since my wife loves it, I'm sure I'll be going back, so I'll try the crepes next time and hopefully have better luck.
