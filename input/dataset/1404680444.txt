So Grateful for Healthy Tails!!! I have a cat that has stopped eating and has been very sick.  I have tried everything to get him to eat to no avail. A friend of mine told me about Healthy Tails so I went right away. The staff was very helpful and friendly. I explained my situation and she gave me some samples of food to take home and try. I was so relived when he actually ate some of it! So thankful. I WILL be buying my food from Healthy Tails
