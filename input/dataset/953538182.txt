You know when you enter some stores, you feel like you're getting bombarded with an associate after associate asking if you need assistance finding anything. It can be a little overwhelming sometimes when you're in the store to browse and not looking for anything in particular.Fry's is like the opposite of that experience.Maybe it's because I don't give the appearance of being a 'serious' customer, but in the several times I've visited this Fry's over the years, I think I've only been asked once if I needed help finding anything. The employees here just seem like they don't want to be bothered at all, or how dare you interrupt their important group conversations. During my last visit, my friend and I walked around almost the entire store, seeing if anything jumped out as a possible impulse buy. It was later during the evening, so there weren't as many customers in the store but still lots of employees to be seen, but none asked if we needed any help. Actually we walked by several who were in groups talking, but pretty much nobody made eye contact or even acknowledged our presence. I don't expect to be treated like royalty, but the fact that we made a round throughout the whole store without one employee even greeting us says something. (Even the guy at the exit stand couldn't seem bothered to make eye contact since we left the store without making a purchase).Oh well. At least they sell an aisle full of designer fragrances.
