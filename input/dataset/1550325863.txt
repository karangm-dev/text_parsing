The good and the bad of this place  (read to end to hear the good). The decor is typical over the top Vegas. Even though the exterior does not look like it. Quick service at first, but that is where that stopped. Once our food came,it was hard to find our waitress. We saw more of the photographer hacking snapshots on cheap postcards. (If I wanted a photo of myself here, I would take a selfie). What bothered me most is the pricing. Pancakes are $10.50 and with it made into a combo they charge $13.50 a $3.00 upcharge. If you have a waffle $8.95 and make it a combo. They charge $13.50. A $4.55 charge for the same combo as the pancakes. I brought this to their attention and I was told that its their pricing and couldn't do anything. They have other pricing discrepancy on the menu as well. The manger asked if my meal was OK. I told her the truth that it was less than. She didn't seem to care or offer to make it better. Pricing here is on the high side, but you get Vegas casino feel.. I could of ate next door at Denny's for half the price. What they do give you is much larger portion. 3 eggs instead to 2. And the sausage links were fat and juicy. I don't know if that justifies the cost. I did mention the lack of service to the manager when leaving. And once again no response, not even a "I'm sorry to hear that". She just rolled her eyes.  My vote next time. Save a couple of bucks and eat next door at Denny's.
