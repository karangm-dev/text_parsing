I went in today to check it out and as soon as i walked in i knew this was the gym for me. It has tons of free weights and free weight equipment. A couple squat racks and designated areas for deadlifting. They have a turf area that you can do sprints, tire flips and push weighted sleds. They also have a nice variety of cardio machines. The locker rooms are kept very nice and clean. Overall it's a great gym and reasonably priced.
