On our first visit to the Chandler, Arizona location, we waited 45 minutes for our food.  We asked for help from several managers, each said they would check on our order.  No one came back with our food or even an update. We finally had to ask for our money back, leaving hungry and upset. It's a shame.  I remember this restaurant from the Scottsdale location many years ago and wanted to try it again.  Unfortunately, we will never step back into the restaurant.  Horrible service, and horrendous management.
