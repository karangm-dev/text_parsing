One word to describe my experience . . . OUTSTANDING !!!Got a Kenwood DNX9990HD bases on the manager's recommendation.   I was kinda hesitated since I have read some unfavorable reviews on the unit. But John assured me that those reviews it's just that, someone's opinion which everyone is entitle to their own. Anyway, I drop a bundle $$$ and had the unit and all the other toys that are available installed in my son's new 2012 F-150 "redneck mobile". Conclusion:  the unit looks great and work great. It was a good but!  Thanks John!
