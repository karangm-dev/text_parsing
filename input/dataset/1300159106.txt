This place is super cool. We had a large group with children and opted for the couch tables indoors. It's a great set up and the staff was wonderfully accommodating for our kiddos. We shared a pitcher of the Diego margarita which was a great deal. The Brussel sprout nachos are a must do for any future visits. Delicious! And I enjoyed the watermelon salad although I found that I couldn't make a dent after all the tasty appetizers - I saved the rest for the next day. My only complaint might be that the fun selection of sauces at our table were all very bland. I'll come back every trip to Scottsdale for sure!
