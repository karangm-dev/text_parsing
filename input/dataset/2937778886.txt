I randomly spent my 30th birthday there on accident because my friend left his credit card there the night before. And we had SUCH A BLAST! It was so much fun! I loved that they all switched off, and they all had great voices! Krystal was amazing! Every time I go to Vegas, I now always want to stop there!!!!
