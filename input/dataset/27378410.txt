Swan is one of the major players on the Toronto brunch scene.  I finally had the chance to come here this past weekend.  We approached the restaurant a few minutes before they opened and they had diners eagerly waiting to come in, a great sign.  The diners decor is so dated but it works in a queen st west hipster way.  The breakfast plate is a great way to gauge any restaurant, and Swans is a little different than most.  First off they don't offer bacon, they offer pancetta, and weirdly capicolla.  I chose the smoked trout with a $3 supplement, but it was well worth it.  The fish was delicately smoked, and it was firm, but not tough.  The eggs and toast were standard, the addition of the broiled tomato was unexpected, and quite charred and smokey.  The potatoes are my favourite part and if they arent good, the whole experience is tainted.  The potatoes were reminiscent of a salt lick.  My sis also had potatoes with hers and she complained to our waitress about them, so she went to the kitchen and asked if they could do anything about it.  She returned with an excuse that all of the potatoes are made the same way and if they gave us any replacements that they would have the same level of saltiness.  This was slightly baffling considering we were the first guests, so how could all of the potatoes be prepared already?  Anyways, she suggested a side salad which was appreciated.  Another waitress first brought the salad to the table beside us, and than realized her error and put it on our table without a word.  I appreciate the solution however if felt very disingenuous.  Overall, Swan has a hip vibe to it but with the poor service and issues with our food, i doubt that i will return.
