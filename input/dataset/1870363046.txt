I expected a lot more from this establishment. I ordered the ribs which being a burger and bbq joint I expected the meat to fall off the bone or at least to be able to cut it with a knife easily not the case. The meat was like elastic hard to cut and extremely hard to chew. Service was mediocre at best.
