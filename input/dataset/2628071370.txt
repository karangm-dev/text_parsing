It's true. Severance Hall is one of the most beautiful concert halls not just in America, but the entire world. It was completed during the Great Depression and features a majestic classical fa√ßade that hints at the Art Deco grandeur that lies inside.Throughout the interior, you'll find lots of aluminum accents because the Severances were friends with the founder of Alcoa, and lots of lotus blossom motifs, a nod to Elizabeth Severance's favorite flower. The breathtaking, soaring grand foyer is filled with dozens of Italian marble columns and additional bronze, brass, and marble adornments. You can imagine it as the perfect setting for an event or reception involving lots of formal waltzing.If you haven't already spent lots of time gawking in admiration at the aforementioned public spaces, you'll be immediately drawn, upon entering the concert hall, to its glittering aluminum ceiling, with intricate detailing that, according to legend, evokes the lace patterns of Elizabeth Severance's wedding dress. You'll also notice the grand 6,000-pipe organ behind the stage.Although the hall didn't have the best acoustics when it first opened, it underwent significant improvements under legendary conductor George Szell, plus additional renovations in anticipation of the year 2000, creating an acoustically magnificent space that complements the aural firepower of what many consider to be America's finest orchestra. Well worth a visit, particularly as a patron of the Cleveland Orchestra and/or special events like the Cleveland International Piano Competition.
