Went to this SAMs today to have a battery purchased and installed... The super tatted up chick Jess helped us pick out the battery we needed and was super awesome!Battery came with a 3 year free replacement and installed for 100.87 out the door. While they installed it, which took about 45 minutes we walked around and got dinner and beer. Great service! Thanks Jess!
