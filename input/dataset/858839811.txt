I just love Ladybug. The service is always friendly and fast. The place is very clean. The food is yummy. I had the "Charlie Brown" and the Cheesy Potato Soup. Very fresh. I love that they put cucumbers on that particular sandwich. What I like is that they will deliver just one sandwich with no minimum. The prices very reasonable.
