I work in Station Square now so, after 3 weeks, I'm finally stopping by to try their fudge.  I can't believe I've managed will-power this long!OMG!  They had several to choose from -- all made here.  Once I saw the sign for dark chocolate with caramel and sea salt atop the fudge itself, that's all I needed to see.  I sampled (like I wasn't gonna like it?) then purchased a 1/2 pound plus a bit to finish off a row being sliced.  That and a diet coke came to about 10 bucks.  Expensive?  I dunno; don't care.  It is wicked decadent and a danger to my lunch hour.Oh, yes... they have ice cream, Sarris candies, gum, mints, cold bottled sodas. too.
