Took our slightly husky cat "Butters" to his first real vet visit and it couldn't have gone any better!! Great facility! But most importantly, great Staff!!  From the walk in, being greeted by Meredith to meeting Raquel, the Veterinarian Nurse, who was amazing with our ButterBall. Very welcoming and comforting to us "Humans" but most importantly, our little big guy. Very knowledgable about cats, as I can guarantee they are with dogs. So much great advice and care directions. They will soon enough have two more patients.
