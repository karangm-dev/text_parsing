Mostly Mod is a smaller retro store on 8th street. This place doesn't have a quarter of the selection of Who Knew?, but the stuff is a ton cheaper. We saw two retro coffee tables we liked that were in perfect condition, both were under $30. We bought a pair of couches there that were perfect to fit in the small space of our apartment and he threw in one of the tables we liked for free. Also their delivery service is only $25. Super friendly, super knowledgable owner - this is a great place to stop in for that hard-to-find piece of retro furniture
