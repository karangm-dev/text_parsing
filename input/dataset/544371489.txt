Joined a girlfriend here for a quick bite after hearing so/so reviews.. neither one of us knew much about the place other than it was good food!We sat at the bar upstairs at 5pm on a Tuesday; the bartender quickly and very happily made us two (delicious) mocktails (both of us are pregnant) and we were off to a great start. Not even close to a Shirley Temple; freshly squeezed juices and everything!! From there we split a burger, crostini with goats cheese/tomato salsa of some sort and the calamari; hands down best happy hour menu i have seen in a long time. there were so many choices to us those were the top three, well at least that our diets will allow at the moment.To top it all off when the check came we were not left mind boggled as it totaled out at $23 and some odd change. It was a complete breath of fresh air from the likes of the fancy-pants places that think because they have fancy decor and are "trendy" they can change you upwards of $40 just because and don't give a hoot about "happy hour". We both left with full tummies and making plans for the next time to swing by! We will definitely be back, and hopefully next time sans babies.. their actual cocktail list looked amazing!
