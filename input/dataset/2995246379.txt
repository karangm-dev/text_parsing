I both attended and hosted multiple events at Sigmas - training, executive offsite meeting and a retirement party.  The staff are professional and very organized.  Every detail  has been considered - from extra insulated windows to keep out street noise to decaffeinated ice tea.  All the touches a trainer or meeting facilitator could wish for in the technology and variety of spaces (whether board room, lunch cafe, formal reception area, or training room).
