Truly some of the best frozen yogurt I have ever had! I dropped by on a Saturday night and was surprised to how full the place was. I went in and tried a couple of samples - sample cups were on the counter by the frozen yogurt and I just grabbed a couple of the small cups to try 1-2 flavors. I wanted something fruity and something more creamy so I went with dulce de leche and pomegranate raspberry. O M G The dulce the leche did not disappoint! It was so delicious that I hope it sticks around for a while so I can keep going back and getting it. Topping-wise, they have a great variety of toppings with different fruits, chocolates (including kit kats which I love!), chocolate chips, nuts, and sauces. I will definitely be going back to try more of the flavors in the future!
