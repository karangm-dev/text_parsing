I know little to nothing about biking and was looking for something to use on the Rail Trails and around the neighborhood.  The girl that helped me was super knowledgeable and did not make me feel as though my questions were silly (I can assure you to a pro biker I'm sure they were!) I never felt pressured in the least and was given all the time I needed to test out my options.  The entire staff was friendly and super helpful.  I will definitely be returning when I need any repairs or tune ups in the future!  A+ for their customer service!
