Because I had a Groupon and because we generally like Mediterranean style foods we decided to give it a try even though it was at the other end of town and a 20 min.  We were generally disappointed.  There was nothing in the website that would have tipped me off that it was a simple, small fast food place with plastic plates and utensils.  But we were game for the meals.  The food was OK, though the staff could not explain what shwarma meant and how it was different from other similar foods.  I had the steak shwarma plate with had reasonable sized portions of rice and vegetables, and carrot sticks soaked in a spice liquid (which I did not care for or knew about).  My wife got a chicken shawarma on a bread roll, which was filling.  The staff messed up her order and gave her fries to another customer, told us the fries would be coming out soon (even though the other customer received an added plate of rice to make up for screwing up their order.  We never received the fries even after mentioning it again at the counter.  Needless to say the quality of the service undercut the quality of the food and we shall not be going back.  And as a tip to the owner, we observed the male who appeared to be in charge, taking the orders and payments, opening the cash drawer on his own when there was no payments.  The rest of the cooking staff and the manager would vanish into the back leaving all the customers (3 small groups) alone in the front (and us still waiting for those fries) feeling abandoned.  My wife commented that if this had been her franchise she would have fired all the staff.  We were not told about the card for 5 meals.  All in all very poor service.  Even if I was in the area I'd not go there.  There are too many other good places for mediterranean food to waste time going here.
