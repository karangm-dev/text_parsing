I am a frequent visitor of Pacos Tacos, my husband and I usually come here every Sunday after church at 11 and are the first customers to open the doors. The food is always amazing (I have never had one bad item), the service is good, and we enjoy the music selection. Since I come here so often one of my friends gave me a gift card to here for my birthday (she knows me well). That next Sunday we put it to use only to find that the money she put on it did not register on the gift card. The manager came over to let us know this and was very apologetic. I spoke to my friend in regards to the amount that was on the card and the manager put that amount on the card and more for our troubles, no questions asked. The customer service she provided went above and beyond what she needed to do. We thought we loved Pacos before but now we know this is the best place in Charlotte. Since this is my favorite place I will also give some recommendations on the food I love here: Veggie fajitas, enchiladas de dennis (I usually see if I can get it with ground beef instead of chicken), the beef chimichanga (we get this with queso over the whole things instead of the half and half sauce), chopped salad is amazing as well as the chicken tortilla soup, the guacamole is made fresh at the table, the queso is amazing, the tacos are amazing I love the pacos taco, gringo beef, wood grilled skirt steak, and we love the BBQ buttered Corn. Again I cannot recommend Pacos enough, thank you for showing quality customer service and the best Mexican food in town.
