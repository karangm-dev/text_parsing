These guys literally saved me.  I had a RFP due during the holidays.  With my computer and printer crashing, I was in a serious bind.   I usually go to Staples Printing Centers-- but, they couldn't get it done in time.   So, I got on the Peoria Chamber website and International Minute Press/Desert Sky Printing came to the rescue.  They finished my printing and the RFP was turned in with 1 hour to spare.  I recommend them highly!
