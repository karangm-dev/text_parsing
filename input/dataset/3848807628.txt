Upon arriving, we stood at the host stand looking for someone to seat us since there was a sign that said "please wait to be seated". It took forever for someone to come to the front even though we could see into the kitchen and the staff was just standing back there chatting. After finally getting sat, our waitress came and had a bad attitude. She looked like she would rather be anywhere but there and she never smiled and was just unpleasant. I think her name Adriana or something like that? If you can't be somewhat friendly, and think customer service means being snappy, then you're in the wrong line of work.
