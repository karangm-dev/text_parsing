I purchased a groupon and was sorry the minute I walked in.  They were rude.  I had polish on and was told that it was 10 dollars extra to take it off.  The manicure sucked and the skinny girl filed my cuticle until the skin came off.  I told them I wanted a hair cut she did not even wash my hair and she charged me $35.00.  She then had the nerve to ask me if I wanted to book another appointment, I almost laughed in her face!  I don't know why people are in the people business and know nothing about customer service.
