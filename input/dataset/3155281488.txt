I have taken my dog to this clinic for almost 5 years, the latest vets have been there for a couple of years and I continued to take my dog there. They will take good care of your animals.  My issue stems from needing to take my dog in for his rabies shot, they won't give him his shot without a wellness exam which is an extra $40. He had a wellness exam there about 7 months ago and is perfectly healthy. I really don't want to spend an extra $40.  I can take him to the Petsmart clinic or humane society clinic and get the shot minus the wellness exam, and my vet said "fine"!!!! After many years and $100's of dollars spent there, I was surprised and disappointed  that he wouldn't let me take him there and just pay him for a rabies shot, after all he'd be going back in in a couple of months for his other shots and ANOTHER wellness exam!!!!! I wll be leaving this clinic after almost 5 years. I thought a relationship with the vet was valualble but not to me just to him.  Loyalty goes both ways......
