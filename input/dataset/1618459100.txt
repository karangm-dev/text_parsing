Once again I am completely "under-whelmed".For the price point you'd believe it would be fantastic. Not so much.Ordered the butter fish which is a Roy's classic and received a "new" version on the presentation.The fish was flat and a tad overcooked and the rice was in a shaped triangle.Where was the version atop the forbidden rice?Took two colleagues there for a dinner after a meeting and the bill was right around $300.I am quite sure for $100/person there are better choices in the valley.It seems on more than one occasion at the 2 Roy's in the valley the service has been off. Not, bad per se. Just not what you would expect for a place of this "expected" caliber. A good example would be; the waiter in a clueless fashion interrupting speakers in a business meeting to ask "how the bread tastes?"Why? because your server just started at Roy's last week.Perhaps they have issues with employee turnover as well.Over priced, unprofessional, simply just not that good.
