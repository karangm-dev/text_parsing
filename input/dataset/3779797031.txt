My little girl started at SpringStone Montessori School in Ms. Rosemary and Ms. Adriana's class right when she turned 2. The care and education she received there was nothing short of exceptional, as we watched her bloom from an extremely shy baby into the confident, intelligent and assertive little girl she had become. From my many observations, what really sets SpringStone apart from other schools is the nuture, patient reinforcements and individual learning plan that their students receive. We also appreciated our (parents') daily interactions with the teachers - this helped us immediately reinforce any teaching subject or course-correct any behavior that needed working on. Ms. Jennilee and Ms. Chang, who help manage the school have also been extremely helpful and accommodating.  My daughter had since moved on to The Meadows School. SpringStone prepared my daughter well academically and emotionally up to and through the transition. Even though she is now one of the youngest children in her new class, she compares well with her peers.I am grateful for the love and care that my daughter received at Springstone, and wholeheartedly recommend SpringStone to any parent looking for a nurturing environment for their little one's educational experience.
