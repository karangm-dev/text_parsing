My husband purchased a gift card for a spa day for me and my niece as a birthday gift and it was nothing short of fabulous. The amenities and staff were top notch. Started off with a wonderful facial followed by the relaxation room which had soothing music, subtle waterfall, snacks, and dark lighting. We then enjoyed the steam room, jacuzzi, and then pool. What a view! We are residents in fountain hills and would highly recommend this place for a spa day. The services purchased (massage, facial, etc) come with all day access to all the amenities, which also include tennis, gym, and all other activities mentioned above. S.
