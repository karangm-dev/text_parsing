What's not to love about Lamesa?!? Everytime I come and bring new guests with me, they're always blown away by the flavour and of course, the garlic rice. On the weekend, it's exactly the type of brunch I'm looking for - something uber savoury and casual. I'd highly recommend both the steak & eggs or the langonisa.
