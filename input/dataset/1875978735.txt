Moved quite a bit farther away from my regular shop so I decided to search Yelp for a possible replacement. It was a tough decision as I feel a good auto shop ranks right up there with a good dentist/doctor/lawyer in importance.After two visits I can happily say that I now have a new regular shop.Terry is a straight shooter who really knows his stuff. I also like the fact that he is detail-oriented, and takes pride in his work. You couple all that with very reasonable prices, a friendly atmosphere, and a great location made my decision a no brainer.
