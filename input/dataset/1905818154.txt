When I moved out of Arizona, it was hard to find a company that would manage a single house. The team at Active Renter have been attentive from Day 1 and continue to be so, despite having much larger clients. Richard is knowledgeable in the Phoenix real estate market and makes recommendations, based on years of experience that I know I can trust. He has gone above and beyond in helping my family with other real estate matters, as well. I highly recommend him and Active Renter Property Management.
