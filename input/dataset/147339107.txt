O.M.G. Heaven. A tastebuds' Utopia! This small boutique shop specializes in fine chocolates and caramel. The chocolate and caramel are both so soft they literally melt in your hand within 20 seconds of holding it. The Coconut Curry Cashews are to die for. And the Vienna Hot Chocolate is rich, creamy, the consistency of pancake syrup, that's how exquisite it is, folks! Apparently, this chocolate is processed and refined right in Montreal. If I heard correctly, it's done from Cacao 70.Won't bore you with all the intricacies, will just insist that you stop by this independently owned business. This is a perfect stop for a gift or an indulgence. Either way, somebody's going to be very happy!
