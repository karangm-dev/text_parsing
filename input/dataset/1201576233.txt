We stopped in for a quick bite before an appointment. Unfortunately that ended up our undoing. We had a lovely meal but it was served with a marked lack of enthusiasm on a very different timeline than ours. Hubby had an omelette that he said was absolutely delicious. I opted for an overpriced novelty drink and small side order of French fries. The menu looked promising. As a point of reference, check for the omelette, fries and my novelty drink without tip was $45.  With so many options around the hotel and the strip this wouldn't be my first choice especially if time is an issue.
