All the people that give Lou's a so-so review are first timers who don't know the place.  I eat here at least 2-3 times a month and the service is always friendly and fast.  The food is very solid, especially if you stick with items that you would expect to be good at a bar oriented place - burgers, cheese steak, wings, sandwiches, and fish n chips are all very good.  If you order a prime rib special or a salad at a bar, I am surprised that your surprised it is "just OK."  Lou's knows what it is - a bar with food - and does that very well.  The food is much better than what you normally get at a local watering hole and the service is great.
