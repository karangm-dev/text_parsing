The uptown location is AWFUL. We ordered wings, BBQ chicken pizza (no onions) and garlic knots. The estimated arrival time was 45 minutes. An hour and a half later we called the location and were told that they "forgot to print our ticket out" and that the order would be no charge. Another 45 minutes later and our order finally showed up. They forgot our garlic knots, and we were charged for the order. This location is lucky that it is conveniently placed with this kind of service. We will NEVER use this location again.**Forgot to mention that our pizza had onions on it. Disgusting.
