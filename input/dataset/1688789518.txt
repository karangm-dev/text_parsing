While this place does provide large portions of food the quality of it seemed subpar. My favorite part of the meal was the breadsticks and the salad, they were actually very tasty. The unlimited wine tasted watered down, but it's free so I didn't expect much out of it. In conclusion the food was pretty pricy considering how bland it was. The service was good, although, when I made a reservation the night before, they had no recollection of my reservation when I arrived :/2.5/5 would not go again.
