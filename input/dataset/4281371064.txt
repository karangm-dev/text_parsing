This place is my introduction to Cleveland's food culture. It is beyond-my-imagination wild. Checklist menu makes me wonder if their servers are all lazy or if the owner wants to save money by cutting down more trees. Then putting sunny side up egg, peanut butter, pork bean sauce, fruit loops, Spaghetti O's (and a million other things) on hot dog makes all their hot dogs struggle because they are having identity crisis. They do not know if they are hot dogs, or hamburgers. Same thing with Barrio in Lakewood. Their tacos do not know if they are tacos, or burritos. The pinball machines, on the other hand, are classy and saving this place. Please put yourself in the shoe of a hot dog, and let them be simply happy hot dogs instead of mutant hamburgers.
