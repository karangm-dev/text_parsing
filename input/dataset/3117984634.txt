My son has playing football for this league and SNYSA for over 5 years now, I've been trying to call them since before the dead line with registration so that i didn't run into paying the late fee of $35, and absolutely no luck in staff answering the phones, I work 12 hour shifts and can't make it down there, I FINALLY got a hold some one today and he had NO remorse at all because i didn't leave a message.. All he could say " Well it's a month into season and there's nothing i can do now" Meaning waiving the late fee because there staff NEVER picks the phones up.. My son WILL not play for this league ever again!! Mind you every season at least 4 teams want my son, so i hope your $35 late was worth losing a valuable player!!
