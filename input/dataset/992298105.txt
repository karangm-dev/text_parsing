$$$$$$ for Boho? No thanks! I've been shopping at Anthropologie in Beverly Hills and NYC since my teens. While it was always a little pricier than I would have preferred, I splurged for pretty, unique and well made garments. Since bringing the chain to Canada, the prices are DOUBLE that of American stores. Not to mention that the American stores have better and more frequent sales. After browsing a few times, I refuse to shop there in Toronto. The store itself is cleverly set up like a nice thrift shop, but the prices are astronomical for ho-hum things made in China. I have honestly found more beautiful and better crafted Bohemian clothes in the finer thrift shops downtown. That is the style Anthropologie is venturing after; a vintage Boho look. At that price, I'd rather look cookie-cutter.
