Ordered via Uber Eats. One side was incorrect (gave French fries instead of Mac and cheese). Food was not split correctly as all of the bread was packaged with one meal. Two drinks and two meals = one straw and one fork at Slim Chickens apparently. Food quality was good.I don't believe I'd order from this restaurant in the future, especially with a Cane's so close.
