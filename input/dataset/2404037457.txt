Bre is a gifted physical therapist who uses a holistic approach to understand the core of the issue rather than just treating the symptoms.  I've left every appointment in sheer disbelief at what she has been able to accomplish as compared to a conventional physical therapy approach.  I'm grateful for the important, healing work she does and the relief she has been able to give me in only a few sessions.
