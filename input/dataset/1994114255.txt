Absolutely fantastic. If you are looking for a quiet, relaxed, and delicious dinner...this is the place. We went once for dinner and it was fantastic. Loved the BYOB, food was great, and our waiter was very knowledgable with the menu. Recently we returned for Carmela's Cooking Class. Can't say enough about this experience. Delicious food cooked right in front of you. What other restaurant owner shows you how to make their food and gives you the recipe? Carmela sat with us after the class and talked about Italy. She made us feel so welcomed and comfortable. It felt like we were at a friend's house for dinner. It was a great experience!If you are looking for authentic Italian food, you have to go. If you are looking for a fun date night, you have to go. You must try La Travola Italiana!
