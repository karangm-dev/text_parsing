Omg I love the food here. I go here weekly for the chicken Penang or the pad Thai or the fried rice or any of their wide noodle dishes (can't remember their names). It's amazing food and very sweet Ruby with her wonderful customer service. Oh and sometimes I get the chai tea and that's pretty good too. =)
