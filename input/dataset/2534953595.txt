Waited over an hour to be served.  Knew going, there would be a wait.  Ordered the 2 meat plate with sides(Brisket and ribs). The meat was cold. Not even a hint of it being warm.  The brisket was just ok but the only real flavor the ribs had was of pepper.  Sides of beans and grits were also served cold.  For the price of the meal at the very least you'd expect it served warm.
