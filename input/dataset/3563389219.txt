OK so I just called today at 2:00pm to get a one month old check up for my son to be scheduled for next week some lady named Amanda said that newborn's don't need a check up until they are 2months. That's false....  I had an appointment previously scheduled with my pediatrician in the east valley but, I'm moving to the west valley and needed a new pediatrician so I thought to give them a call but obviously there staff don't know what they are talking about. Well she doesn't.. So I scheduled one with a different office that said they do.
