I was relieved it wasn't chaotically busy as I anticipated for a Suns home game. Tried the pretzel & cheese appetizer and the hummus...both very savory! Ordered the filet mignon which was cooked perfectly. What sent me over the edge were the desserts! We shared 3 amongst the group: the peanut butter cup, the salted caramel pudding, and the molten chocolate cake. I couldn't decide which one i loved the most!
