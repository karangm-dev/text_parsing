I'm very picky when it comes to eating, ackee salt fish and dumpling from others.. but oh my goodness. There ackee salt fish and dumpling makes me happy! The rice and peas is good, and so is the jerk chicken.. although I had better jerk chicken, I'm giving this 5 stars because the ackee salt fish and dumpling and banana tasted so good
