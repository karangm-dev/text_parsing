Definitely one of the busiest stalls in the food court of the Faubourg building. I come here once in a while in between classes. Their noodles are always freshly made, and cooked to order.This is one of a few locations in Montreal where the noodles are hand made and freshly made every day. Protip: it's cash only, and ask for some of their home made chilies they keep behind the counter for regulars.
