I had a similar experience as one of the other reviewers... mainly that after the work was done the tech informed me that the invoice was nearly triple what was quoted prior to the work being done, but there was nothing in writing and that it was my misunderstanding. On top of that, the work was done incorrectly. I had a couple of relatively heated arguments with Sun Devil, in which they assumed no blame or responsibility, and proceeded to belittle and insult me. I do not recommend Sun Devil Pool Supply.
