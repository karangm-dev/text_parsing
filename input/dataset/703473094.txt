Went there last night for the second time since it opened. And just as impressed with the food. Hubby had the san tan devils brew on tap (they also offer four peaks on tap). Started with the crispy egg rolls. They serve them with fresh mint and lettuce leaves and encourage you to wrap the rolls with them. Yum! Hubby had the shaken beef and cleaned the plate. I had the caramelized salmon dish. We both really enjoyed the scallion broth that both dishes are served with. People of Surprise! Don't miss out on this restaurant! We need to keep them in business since we have far too few independently owned restaurants to choose from! Besides, it's delicious!
