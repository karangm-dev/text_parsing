So I normally rent from enterprise.  15 years of rentals, and I've never had an issue.  Great company and great customer service.  This week, enterprise was out of cars so I decided to give hertz in Las Vegas a try.  I drove the car from the airport, to my hotel, and back and forth on the highway to a hospital.  That's it.  Today I returned the car, and the manager, erma I believe, insisted I had taken the car off road and that it would need to be detailed.  She then proceeded to charge me $100 for washing the car.  She would not listen to my protests.  This is criminal, and I was irate.  I took pictures of the car, which I am happy to provide these as proof that all this car had on it was some dust from the highway.  To the manager who was sure I took this mini van type car off road, I have news for you.  Las Vegas was built on a desert!! There is dust in a desert.  I think Hertz should be held accountable for this predatory practice.  I will never rent from Hertz again.  Beware!
