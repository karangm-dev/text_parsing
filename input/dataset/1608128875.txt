The first time I came here, a little over a year ago, the food was great. I went back yesterday and it was just ok. I came in an hour before the lunch buffet was going to close, so that was probably part of the problem . I am Vegetarian and they only had 2 vegetarian dishes available that were edible. The Vegetable Marsala had been out all day and was clearly dried out. The rice was good, but some of it was very hard and dry. The Pakora was also not fresh. The only highlight of the meal was the hot, fresh garlic naan. This visit reminded me why I am not a huge fan of buffets. In the end, I paid $48 (for 2) for mostly dry food and naan. If you are coming close to the time they are switching from lunch service to dinner, you'd be better off ordering from the menu :/
