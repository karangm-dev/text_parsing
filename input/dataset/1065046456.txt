No thank you. I don't like sounding like a snob or suggest that it is not possible to run a successful Japanese restaurant if you are not Japanese, but this place is horrible.  These folks aren't Japanese and their inexperience with the food shows.  The sushi rolls are very sloppy and loosely rolled, the crab is not crab, but Krab... Fake for sure.   The worst was the yakitori. Don't bother, because it is really a teriyaki shishkabob with broccoli and squash. The meat was over marinated and under cooked.   Run away and don't look back, there are plenty of authentic places around that don't cost any more than this place and will give you real Japanese food. The only thing Japanese about the place is the beer.  Very disappointed and won't bother a second time.
