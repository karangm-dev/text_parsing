Dr. Mary Deka is an amazing gynecologist! She makes you feel comfortable and at ease. I always look forward to seeing her. I am sure that sounds strange when one is talking about their gyno. :-) The office is extremely clean, welcoming and modern. The staff at PV OBGYN are amazing as well! Dr. Deka's nurse, Grey, is wonderful.  If you need an annual, or are looking for an amazing DR to deliver your baby, Dr. Deka is your girl! I would sincerely recommend her to anyone!
