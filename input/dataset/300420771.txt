I would have to say this is not only one of my favorite places to go have a great, fresh, and authentic made meal but also have a drink after a long day! They offer both great meals that always so fresh & right from the kitchen to your table but they make some delicious drinks as well! The restaurant has such a unique layout with the open kitchen which makes it a very nice place to sit & eat. The customer service is always great, Bryce the owner doesn't just own the restaurant but he is also the one who will take your order, make you one amazing drink, & wait your table!! It makes your experience there very nice to see how much pride everyone puts into their work!
