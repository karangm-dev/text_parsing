I visited with my friends again, this time to try the boneless fried chicken. To my surprise, the chicken pieces were juicy and not dry at all. I also liked the grated parmesan cheese and parsley that enhanced the overall flavour of the dish.Compared to the last visit, it didn't smell bad any more, and it appears the men's room was working fine now. The server was still prompt and responsive, and I enjoyed my time here. I would love to come back.
