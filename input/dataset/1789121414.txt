Worst experience of my life! Dr. Thomas redid an old filling and chipped my tooth next to it. Had to go back to fix it. He sliced my tongue on the drill. I ended up having to go to another dentist to fix all his mistakes. He left a filling to high and messed my bit. He is very rude and unprofessional.
