I heart sephora! This is a relative small store when compared to one in a mall but I enjoy shopping on walnut more than I do in the mall so I love this location. I've gotten a one on one session and left with a heavy bag full of things I knew looked good on me. If you join the beauty insider you get these appointments for free. The session that I scheduled was during a super sale- while others were waiting to talk to one the of sale associates I had someone helping me exclusively. I was in and out with everything I wanted and a makeover. I find the employees here very helpful and patient. Returns are a breeze and they will order for you if something is out of stock.
