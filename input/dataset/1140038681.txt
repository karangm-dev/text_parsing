I am building a home in Peoria and moving away from Southern California. I was in need of a color and cut, and knew I had to start locating a new stylist. Being in my sixties, I knew this was not an easy task, coupled with the fact I wanted to cut my hair short for lower maintenance.After conducting research on Yelp, I found Tonia. I called, and immediately was impressed from the start. I set up the appointment, and was not sure if I was ready for a new hairstyle. My fear was looking like the woman my age who have short hair and look matronly and frumpy. Upon meeting Tonia, I found her to be a beautiful, funny, smart, and interesting woman; it would be easy to sit in a chair in her presence for a few hours. I discussed my hesitant desire to cut my hair short. She asked me several questions (a subtle interrogation I learned, as she is no dummy---not smart to cut someones hair off short and be dealing with a freaked out customer whom she does not know...:-) Voila!  I went short, and I LOVE MY HAIR! She gave a precision cut that fit my style and face, and I have never had so many compliments on my hair. She is a truly skilled stylist (also with color), and I am grateful I was able to locate a new one who is so talented, and a joy to be around. After all these years, I have moved around alot with stylists, and loved my current one. It was dreadful to leave her, but I was blessed to have located Tonia. She is truly a professional, reasonable, and aims to please! You will not regret using her!
