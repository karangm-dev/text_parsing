Horrible horrible shipping service. Ordered three textbooks from amazon, free shipping for two of them and one required the normal shipping price. Was expecting to have them shipped through Fedex or UPS, and was surprised to see Ontrac, which I had never heard of. I begin school out of town next week and the textbooks were pricey, and I still have not received them. Ontrac tracking says that it was delivered this afternoon to my front door.....weird because there is nothing on my porch and I never heard a knock or the doorbell. None of my neighbors have received it either. I emailed their customer service and received a relatively quick reply, however she just explained that my issue would be sent to the more local Ontrac representative and they would get back to me.I just want my textbooks! Who knows where they are.
