man went at brunch time (11am) line looked long (out side past the restrooms) but only took about 20mins to get inside.$26 for brunch (breakfast and lunch items) was solid, waffles, eggs, really good bacon, soups, sushi, pizza, roast turkey salad and fruit bars, dessert bar area, cereal bar area, pretty good amount of food, and i feel its cheap for a big hotel buffet, great before a walk down the strip!
