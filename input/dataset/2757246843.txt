The service by store manager was very rude. I wanted to buy something from their store that was on display and wanted to know why we could not buy the item. She was extremely defensive and I wanted to give her feedback that it made no sense not to sell something that was on display. She was very un appreciative she even said that she has so much experience as a store manager that she knew better and client feedback was unimportant.For companies who do not learn and take feedback from clients is a company that will fail. I was very discouraged from the experience.Clients who care enough to tell you are trying to make you improve. There are many stores to shop at and Muji does not have an edge I'll rather spend my money elsewhere. The store manager should have better customer service and a simple " let me take your number so we can call you when the product is in store" is simple 101 customer service
