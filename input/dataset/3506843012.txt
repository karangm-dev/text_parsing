So this was an interesting experience. Pros: very fast service, no wait, friendly staff. Cons: very fast service (like was this food even made today?), no wait (is that because no one wants to eat here?), friendly staff (when you can't understand what your guests are saying, just smile!). Overall, we had fun and I guess that's what counts. Rather than get into everything little thing that went wrong, I'd say...just go with it.
