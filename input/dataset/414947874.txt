I've used this warranty company for years and I was frustrated with how they wouldn't repair things when they were not "installed properly" even they did a inspection on the house before I signed up.  Now they are charging $600 some dollars to replace the water heater at my rental due to "other costs".  $600 is enough to buy a brand new heater and installed by a plumber!  I am switching warranty company to Fidelity Home warranty where if you get comprehensive coverage, they would repair things that were not installed property.  Hope Fidelity won't disappoint me :)
