Oh puh-leaze!  The good reviews must be written about excellent headliners or by shills.  Got supposedly "free" tickets that cost the three of us $40.  They included one watered down drink each.  Yes, even my bottled water (that is clearly labeled $4) cost $10.50, plus a $2.50 upcharge, plus tax, plus whatever else it took to get to the $40.  The MC was horrible, and I never heard so many genitalia jokes in a 60 minute period before from three different comics.  If you go, take lots of money and buy lots of drinks because the only people laughing were drunk, drunk, drunk.  The venue is very mediocre and, as might be expected in Vegas, you have to walk through the casino to get to it.  Showtickets4locals sure was a rip off on this occasion.  Never used them before and never will again.
