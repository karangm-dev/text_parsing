The only reason this place gets one star from me is because I am a huge fan of Guy and I know that if it was by HIM, he himself cooking it, no one would have a problem. His recipes are excellent! First off, there are not places to sit for people who are in a 2 plus hour wait in line. The girls at the hostess booth were more into their own conversation rather than making us feel welcomed. One we got to our table of four we immediately noticed only 2 sets of dining utensils. Okay fine, the waitress will come back and give us more later. FAIL. We asked for water with lemon. The waitress came out with 4 dirty ass glasses and the water tastes like chlorine. Then she forgot our lemons. She looked so irritated when we kindly asked her for lemons which she grabbed from the bar and put out in a glass cup. They were soggy as if cut from days before. I ordered the bacon mac and cheese burger. It was delicious. But still no knife, fork or napkin. I had to get up and grab my own napkin. I caught the waitress eyes and she just ignored me. So when she finally came back, I asked her for two more damn sets of utensils. Pathetic. We always tip but this lady was rude. If you can go anywhere else DONT GO HERE. staff is RUDE. not with the money.
