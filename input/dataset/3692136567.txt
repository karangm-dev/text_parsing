Luckily we looked on yelp and found one of our old favorite hot dog places offers a vegan and vegetarian options. The hotdogs are made from soy beans which are cooked on a completely separate pan specifically for soy bean hot dogs only. I ordered the mac & cheese hotdog with homemade mac & cheese with cheddar and a herb blend. Which was amazing, seriously, couldn't t tell it wasn't a real (meat) hotdog!! And my wife ordered the vegetarian, hotdog which comes with close slaw, tomato, cheddar, green onions and honey Dijon mayo, which she said she really enjoyed. We even had to ask the waiter if he was sure that wasn't meat hot dog!!
