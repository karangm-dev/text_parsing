. Cant remember servers name sorry and i did not let manager know about food issues. I dont like to send food back to the kitchen. I have heard about to many bad experiences when people send food back. It seems crazy that i should have had any issues like this from a Hard Rock Cafe. I appreciate your quick reply and i hope the cooks in the kitchen learn to check the food before sending it out. That is restaurant 101.
