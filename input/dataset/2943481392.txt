This review is for the service dept. Like most businesses that have a monopoly, this one does not give a shit what you think. We were lied to many times. We were told repairs that were not there when we went in were now needed. The work finally was done but we left unsatisfied. They count on the clientele having so much money that they will agree to any repairs without question. If you plan to drive a Land Rover in Las Vegas, know you will have to deal with this service dept.
