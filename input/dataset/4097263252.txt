Crappy place to game, spent $300 while watching my chargers win Monday night and only got soda comp. Then got ripped off from the waitress, put $40 in for a $32 bill then she took it to the other side of the bar and when we are at the door says we didn't put money in for the check. Total crap! Do not waste your money on these rip offs!
