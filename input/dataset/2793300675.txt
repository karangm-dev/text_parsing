Expensive bad airport food. Panini is only hot on the outside and cold on the inside. Have to tell them they forgot half the order. Pizza made me gag. Better off getting food from somewhere with a lower price that matches the quality of the food. Metro supermarket serves better fresh2go. This place needs a restaurant takeover.
