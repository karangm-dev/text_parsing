AMAZING! Tamar is so knowledgeable, professional and careful that I would trust NO ONE ELSE!  I had zoom laser whitening in 2004 and it was horrible- I had extreme sensitivity for many years and it didn't last, my teeth were yellowed again in a couple years.  The TG process actually helps remineralize your teeth, it is gentle but VERY EFFECTIVE!When I first came to TG, my teeth were yellowed- I drink a ton of tea, they had a gray tone- bleaching strips and trays we're wrecking my enamel, and the edges were looking clear.  After my first visit to TG my teeth were beautiful!  Not only were the Hollywood white, the enamel was much improved and they just felt better too!  I was blown away and very happy!Because I still drink tea my teeth will lose the Hollywood white in about 10-12 months but they are still much whiter than average and have never gone back yo how the were on my first visit. I stop in for a touch up once or twice a year because I like to have that "OMG, blinding, glowing, white" type of white and the process has done so much to help my teeth.  Tamar is a great professional!  She is very attentive, extremely careful and she takes great pride in making her clients look amazing! I send everyone I know to her and they love her!  My aunt went to another place when she was out of town and it was horrible- they burned her gums to the point she has to have a graft to repair them and her teeth are so sensitive she can't eat with a fork or drink anything with ice.  Worst of all, they didn't even get her teeth white.  I have gone to Tamar for years and I have never had anything but a great experience and incredible results. People stop me to tell me how great my teeth look. Tamar is very careful and very knowledgeable- there is a huge difference. THE BEST EVER!
