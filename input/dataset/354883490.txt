We were not greeted at the door so were confused about seating, where to sit, so we decided to sit at the bar. After waiting for a few moments, the bartender comes up and asks"what can I get you?" Well how about a menu. What a dumb question. The menu was kind of odd, over priced for the area, nothing really interesting on the menu. The place was disorganized, absent of a manager. I will be surprised if they last a year. Too many better options in the neighborhood.
