So, time is 10:20pm, and its friday, 9/30/16. I could walk, but I chose to save a little energy by riding my bike. Now im used to other employees letting  me leave my bike up front when i ride it, and that's understandable. I've had 2 1000 dollar bikes stolen in Tempe. They hack sawed a u bolt lock. Im not getting my last bike stolen from me. I come into this shit storm almost on a regular basis. The only girl actually putting in some effort around this time, isn't even old enough to sell liquor. Now for some reason the pale skin, soul-less, ginger, wanted to refuse service to me for simply exercising. I don't know if it's because he's never touched a bike, or what. But when I asked for the manager, first off there was nobody  in the store but him and the manager, he got all pissy and refused to talk to me. All over a bike... all this over a bike and me wanting some ice cream. I see little to no customer service at this time. I'd be firing people  if I were a manager. But, I'll continue to try my best to shut stores like this one, the fuck down. Pardon my french.
