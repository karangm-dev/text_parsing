We have had clear protection since May. Initially, no issues. However, about three months ago the garage stopped responding to the commands we were sending from the mobile app. For the last two months I have attempted to get assistance in fixing this issue. Roxanne has promised myself and my husband follow up regarding when someone can come to the home to fix the issue. However, no follow through on this. I called a man named Tony to try to go around Roxanne after she told me someone would come to the house and when I called to follow up she reported that the person she was sending out was actually in California that day she asked me to make myself available. Tony came out to the house, said he didn't know how to fix the problem yet, promised to have someone follow up with us. We haven't heard back from him since- despite our continued efforts to contact him. This week we called and complained and were told that someone would come out in the evening. Again, we made ourselves available but no one showed up. When we called Clear Protection again Roxanne again took down our availability and stated she'd call back within minutes. That was three days ago, still nothing. Awful customer service. Clear protection has been paid for three months for a service they aren't providing.
