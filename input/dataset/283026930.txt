Beware! Their return policy sucks. If you shop early for Christmas and what you buy doesn't work for some reason, your screwed. I bought my hubby a Star Wars lamp a few months ago, I saw that the inventory of the lamps was dwindling, so I didn't want to wait any longer. Sure enough they didn't have any more during holiday shopping time, so I  was glad I got it early. Well the clock on it doesn't work correctly. And the staff at Fry's was like "oh well, too bad for you".I usually only go here if my husband drags me along. So I could totally do without it. I get all my electronics elsewhere, and I will continue to do the same. I will certainly never by a gift here again. I hate the fact we bought a TV there, I hope it doesn't break.BTW I hate the receipt check Nazi's at the exit.
