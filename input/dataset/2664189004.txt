Yikes don't try and get a burrito without meat and cheese you would have thought I asked for the moon!  I was told that the cooks would do it this one time but don't come back on the weekend and expect that to happen again.  How hard is it to remove something from an itemThat has to be assembled anyhow?  Our waitress made a huge deal out of it and that we should be pretty grateful they were willing to do it.
