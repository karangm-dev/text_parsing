Absolutely love this tricked out playground. I think the name should be "Games I Like" and not Gold Spike. What is there not to love about the things to do here! Free wi-fi, pool, tic tac toe, connect four, life sized chessboard, Giant Jenga, beer pong on steroids - and an airstream. I mean, really! If you're looking for an upscale vibe that's smokefree and ching-ching-ching-slot-machine-ring free, this is the place to be. Drink prices are more strip like and there isn't a happy hour (Damn it, Jim) but the ambiance and free games somewhat make up for it. But, a happy hour would be nice - just sayin! Food prices are fair - we had a happy grilled cheese that wasn't all that happy (the bread is more like a brioche and the cheese doesn't melt into it very well) and the portobello mushroom sandwich (delicious!). Everything else looked good on the menu and we will definitely go back to try a few of the 50 different sauces available for wings. I don't eat chicken so maybe they will add a popcorn shrimp or something for pescetarians like me. If you're looking for a place that makes you wish you had a basement - and that basement was a pimped out game room - this is the place to be!
