Been going to Brookstone for years, have always felt well cared for.  Dr.G is awesome, obviously caring and honest.   In the past he has done both cosmetic and more need-based stuff on me (root canal, etc), both with good results.  My front crowns have me smiling for pictures with more confidence....a good thing for sure.  The staff always looks like they love working there too, which says a lot to me.   I thought it was time I left a review as they have been taking care of me for awhile with no negative incident.   Good stuff here....and I am critical.  lol.  --Mel
