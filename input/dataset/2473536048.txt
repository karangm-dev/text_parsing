I had a wonderful experience with Hannah at Brilliant Bridal's Mesa location. She was so sweet and attentive to exactly what I was looking for. After trying a couple of dresses Hannah ended up pulling the perfect dress for me made by the designer I was hoping for and I said yes quickly because I could just feel that it was the one as soon as I put it on! I appreciated her enthusiasm and could tell she was invested in making my experience special. I also love the special offers that Brilliant Bridal offers on their facebook page and the incredible value their dresses hold. Overall, I could not have asked for a better experience and I will be recommending Brilliant Bridal to other brides in the future.
