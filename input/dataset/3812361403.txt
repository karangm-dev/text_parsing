Wow. So disappointed. This place used to be one of my favorite spots. They had great food and happy hour. I went a few times after change of management and felt like their prices were poor and their service had tanked. BUT, I decided to give it another shot (twice). The first time was for reverse happy hour on a Saturday. Not too busy, however we literally sat at the bar for 10-15 minutes (in front of the bar tender walking back and forth) and were not once greeted or given menu. We walked out and didn't go back until today. Now I will actually never go back. We came for happy hour and it was pouring. We were  told by the manager the happy hour is only outside at the bar. Fine. But absolutely no room and there was an adjacent table (literally almost in the bar) free. The waitress was kind enough to ask the manager if we could get happy hour at that table since it was pouring and no other outside area was open. He came by and very rudely emphasized that happy hour was only at the bar and then walked away. The poor waitress was super apologetic. He seriously should not be a manager with that attitude. If he was even remotely friendly, this would have been a totally different ending. Needless to say we left immediately and went to a much friendlier and reasonable restaurant.
