I've frequented a few times before, and have enjoyed the food here each time. The last time I visited was no exception. My donair was completely satisfying, and I loved every juicy bite. My veggie samosa was an even match, a wonderful combination of spice and flavour. However, shortly after eating my meal this time, I experienced dizziness, headache, and a light-headed sensation.  I'm no stranger to MSG since I eat at Chinese places often enough. I'm also no stranger to being dosed with MSG at said Chinese places. I'm saddened, but I will no longer return to this restaurant. There's a reason why every bite is so delicious. None too good for anyone.
