Although I have been going to DeFalco's for years, my last visit was a waste. Two orders of side salads were not included in my take out order. So I returned and received them. Only to return home and find out my 4 orders of meatball subs were not even correct. How do you get meatball subs mixed up? SMH. Not worth the drive since I'm coming from Mesa for what use to be friendly and exceptional service and correct orders of what I order.
