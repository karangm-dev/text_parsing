Customer Care/Service means everything to mewhen it comes to salon services.My experience with Waxing the City and my aestheticianCourtney have been nothing but exceptional. In fact, all staff have been really attentive and pleasant.Courtney is extremely attention to detail and never rushes No a high pressure sales pitch at the front counter and they offer Black Book packages I highly recommend Courtney and the "Mint to Be" sugar scrub
