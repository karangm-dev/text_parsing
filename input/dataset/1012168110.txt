in the past 12 months alot of staff turn over. Some of the care givers are very unprofessional, talking to residents like their little children.   Also, the staff do not wear name tags, they should,  communication problems, between family and staff, no writes anything down, creates alot of confusion. Also when you first arrive the entry is so nice, and so is the sitting atrea with a fireplace, but where the residents spend 24 hours a day, locked down indoors (can not use the back patio, I guess its for "show" ??, is very depressing decor and colors and the place smells too.  We will be looking to move our family member out of there if things do not improve soon.Its gone from bad to Worse.  Do Not rely on their literature believing your loved one will have a room with an "assistance needed" call button, or anything in the bathrooms. A resident could slip and fall in their private bathroom, and lay helpless for up to Two (2) hours!  Don't chance it, skip this facility, for $6,000. + a month, this is pure corporate Greed at its Worst.
