I was glad to hear of a new restaurant coming to Parker CO so I recently tried Kneaders. I have gone 2 times and ordered a sandwich once and a salad the second time. The food is good, but I can't get over all the plastic being used. It is crazy how wasteful this is. They really need to start using dishes for their salads and have utensils that aren't plastic. Can someone explain why they they don't use real dishes?I would rather stick with Panera instead.
