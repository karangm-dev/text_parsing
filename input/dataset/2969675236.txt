I went here for the first time on Saturday, and was pretty excited about it.  I'd been looking forward to trying their hotdogs since I heard about their opening!I went with a Sonoran...  and I've got to say it was lacking.  The bun was plain, no real flavor to it - tasted like it came straight from a grocery store bag.  No real punch to the flavor of the actual dog either.  :/Maybe I'm just spoiled to the dogs at Jack Beagles.  They've always tasted amazing and have loads of flavor.Two dogs + two beers (no sides) came out to $17.I really wanted to like this place, and even bought a Groupon for it that I haven't used yet.  Any takers?  :P
