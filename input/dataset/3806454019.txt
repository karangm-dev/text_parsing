I'm a fan of Aroma as a chain, just not this location.  Not very clean - saw a fairly large bettle move across the table where food orders come, bathrooms could use a refresh.  Food that didn't need to be made to order was a bit too tired ( I had a fruit salad I probably wouldn't serve guests if it was in my fridge).  Try Aroma, just a different location.
