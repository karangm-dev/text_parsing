I give it a 1-star rating for a simple reason:  it is ridiculously difficult to end your membership (which auto-renews once they have your credit card details).  I am a big opponent of this type of business practice, and find it shamefully unethical (see my review of Extreme Fitness for another example of this).  You can't do it on their website, or by email.   You have to call, and you have to dig and dig to find out what number to call. After you call in and get to an operator, you are told to mail or drop off your membership card with a letter of explanation.  There is small print on their website about a penalty of up to $500 for failing to return the membership card (yikes!!  where did they get that valuation from???)  I asked the operator on the phone:  "after I send it to you, how can I confirm you've received it?  What happens if someone on your end loses it, will I still be billed for it?"   The operator told me "oh, we never do that."    Wow, that doesn't put my mind at ease:  I'm Canadian, I've been dealing with Rogers and Bell my whole life, I am too jaded to trust in your company's integrity (especially since it was so hard for me to find any info on how to cancel my membership).I got a company car, and I no longer need your services.  Making it so difficult for me to leave has turned me into an evangelist for Zipcar, and I don't even know anything about them.  Go Zipcar!!!
