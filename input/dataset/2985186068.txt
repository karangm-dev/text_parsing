Great tapioca cafe.  All the standard stuff: milk teas, variety of "bubbles" to add to them, fruit teas, slushes, and popcorn chicken.  Probably some other stuff too, they had a big menu.  It's a big place too, probably the biggest I've seen.  It's also packed with asians, which is a little odd for this part of the country.  I think we saw more asians in this one cafe than we see in all of South Carolina.The teas were great; it was out of the way for us (about a 15-min drive) but worth the trip.
