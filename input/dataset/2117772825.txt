As of a few days ago I never knew this amazing place existed!  I found it after searching Google for local lowrider bike parts to finally start rebuilding my '81 Schwinn Stringray.  I met Henry at the door and he gave me some basic info about the place.  I briefly told him about what I wanted to do with my bike and informed me I came to the right place.  He directed me to the owner of the place for additional info.  Later, Henry, showed me all the parts I needed in their massive facility.  He seemed enthusiastic about helping me build my bike which was cool!  The museum area upstairs was occupied by a private event, so I was only able to look from the doorway.  Claims to have the largest collection of bikes and parts  in the country and after a tour of the place you would definitely believe it!  Loved this place and I'll be back often until my bike is finished!
