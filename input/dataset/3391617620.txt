I have been at San Paulo for 2 years now.  I have never lived in a gated community where the staff have been as friendly.  The maintenance staff as well are very friendly and finish work orders very quickly.The pool and common areas are very clean.  The gas grills at the pool work great and we use them often.  I have nothing bad to say about San Paulo.  I will be renewing my lease again.
