Would concur with another reviewer - food is bland and nothing special.  Had the stir fried pork with black bean and it was underseasoned.  The fish with creme sauce came with frozen vegetables (peas, carrots, corn).  One meal was served first, and the second came about 10 min. later.  As well, the HK milk tea lacked flavour and was warm.  Wasn't worth the $22 for lunch, and will not return.
