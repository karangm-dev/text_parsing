We came hoping to get some healthier fare. Vegan food should be at least that. Everything on the menu was fried and we had very little to choose from. While others would call this "comfort food" I disagree. We ordered the comfiest of comfy foods, mac and cheese, which turned out to be overcooked elbows swimming in vegan cheese sauce. I love salt, but this stuff was over-salted to an extreme. We ordered a salad because there just wasn't anything else healthy on the menu. Since we were only in town for the weekend, we only hit a few places in TO. I understand that vegans may want to experience what bar-b-que places can provide for meat eaters, but they also want healthy food. I'm not sure you can do both. Ultimately we were disappointed that we had wasted one of our get-away meals at The Hogtown Vegan.
