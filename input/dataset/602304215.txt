Like the atmosphere With the remodel. Went to see a band on a Friday night very good music.. REALLY REALLY HORRIBLE service inside at the bar two girls that did not have a clue behind the bar.. Very rude and slow 20 minutes for a drink is absurd. Then when u ask nicely they give u an attitude like its not there problem
