We were in search of the famous kouign amman ( pronounced "queen yah manh ") and hurrah, we found it in this fun neighborhood with too many lovely restaurants to sample on our short trip to Montreal. I've tasted my fair share of these pastries from Bretagne and these are right up there although I've never seen them served in pie-like wedges. No matter- the taste is there. My son got a chocolate tarte and it was so rich he couldn't finish the small portion. The staff are very kind and even let my daughter use their restroom although it was not for customers. And they let us watch as they rolled out the dough and laminated it with butter for their many pastry delicacies- croissants etc. This is a must visit!
