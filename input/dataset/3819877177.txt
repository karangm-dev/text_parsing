I just moved from Oregon and really needed a place to wash my dog after going to Lake Mead. This was the best experience I could've ever asked for. The workers were kind and genuinely nice people. They not only helped me figure out what I was doing, but they also remembered my dog the next time we went in. There are amenities galore, and I truly believe this place is one of the top self dog wash places.
