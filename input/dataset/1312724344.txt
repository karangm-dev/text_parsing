The waiters are amazing and very attentive to their customers needs. We never felt like they forgot about us and didn't have to ask for refills. The food was amazing! The lighting is perfect and the seating? Oh my goodness.. Amazing! Overall I loved my time there. It was my fianc√©es first time and we'll definitely return. Thank you Waverly's!!!
