Great concept, unfortunately it's expensive and they make it really difficult. You have to get a membership card and then load money onto that card. Of course they only let you load in increments, and the increments don't match the cost of the golf. Therefore , you always end up having too much money on the card. If you loose the card, they'll reprint it for you after waiting in the long customer service line, and they charge you to reprint the card. C'mon, why all the hassles?Next time I'll go bowling and spend 1/3rd as much with none of the membership card hassl
