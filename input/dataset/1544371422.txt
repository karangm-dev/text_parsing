Extremely pleased with Barefoot Organic. We've used them 3 times and each time I'm impressed with their work.  Our carpets were clean and fresh and dried quickly.  We even had the carpets in our van cleaned this time and they look brand new.  I really appreciate their professional and service-oriented approach to business.  They tell the truth about pricing and the price quoted is for full service - they don't try to up sell you once they get to your house.  Shantell is very friendly and sends out a detailed confirmation prior to the service.  Justin (who cleaned our carpet) is very kind and professional.  I've had a lot of different carpet cleaning companies over the years and Barefoot Organic Carpet Care beats them all!
