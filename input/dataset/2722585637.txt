What's up with the people who work @ this mall? Besides Renee @ New York and the dressing room attendant guy @ Ralph Lauren; everyone else was snobby, not helpful, not friendly. I understand that most people who shop here are tourists but some like me are locals and if treated well, will return and recommend to others.
