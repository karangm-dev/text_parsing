I went to Dr. Goth for a couple procedures, including wisdom teeth and to have a suspicious oral growth removed. Only one word - fantastic! His staff is excellent, and his art in dentistry and patient care unsurpassed. Cut and dried - Dr. Goth was outstanding. He is the man to see in the Pittsburgh area.
