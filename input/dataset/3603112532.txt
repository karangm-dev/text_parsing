We stopped in here for dinner because it was very close to our hotel and we were able to be seated immediately. They have outdoor seating, which we chose since it was a nice evening. The seating its self was lacking. The staff was nice but not on top of their game. They did not come around often enough and made some errors.I was feeling like something simple so I ordered the Breakfast Burro. It comes stuffed with scrambled eggs, green chiles, potatoes and cheddar cheese. I chose to add sausage. It was good sized, enough to fill me up. The flavor was a touch bland, but I was able to overcome that with some hot sauce.This is not a bad place. If you are looking for affordable bar food, then it probably will be ok.
