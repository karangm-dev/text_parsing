I like going to rito's because of their fresh bread, but the women that work their are not very nice.  Every time I come in they seem to go in the back and hide. The one lady (who I think is the manager, but not quite sure) never ever smiles and is actually quite rude. I do like their lunch meat though, some of their cookies are great. Some of their desserts are not very fresh though, like their cupcakes. All in all I do go their because my family loves their Italian bread, but they need new employees.
