This hotel is by far over-priced ($175 night) and not worth it. The rooms are average and not roomy. The sink outside the bathroom has bad placement considering the walkway. Having multiple women trying to get ready at the same time is ridiculous. The actual shower area has sub par caulking around the inside and shows it age. The room had only three large shower towels and when we called for extra, took two phone calls to receive them. Parking and thr price of it sucks. No pool or hot tub area either. The worst was hearing the boxy floor heater making hissing noises all night long.
