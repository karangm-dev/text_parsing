I do not know how I should start to revile this hotel. I'll try to be as unbiased as I can. First off, my dad has made a reservation on booking before he let me know. In spite of lack knowledge, I did not intend to google this hotel.  This hotel is located in downtown  that's only thing that I could say as a positive about this hotel. There's no bell boy to pick your lovage up to upstairs, you gotta carry them to your room, which pretty uncomfortable particularly you have heavy and lots luggages. Thankfully hotel has its own closed park area, however it is not available by escalators, you gotta climb stairs and go outside, thereafter you'll enter hotel. That's pretty uncomfortable in winter time though distance is short.Hotel has free wifi that's true, probably they won't mention pace internet, which is really so poor. Rooms are not clear enough. I'd not even suggest this hotel to my enemy. Stay away from it, before you regret it like me....
