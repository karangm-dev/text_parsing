This may officially make me a germaphobe or a bona fide movie grinch, but I can't handle these theaters. Ironically, on our way there, my husband asked, "Is it clean?" Well, the answer was a big fat no on this evening. In the ladies' room, I found two stalls out of order. There was trash littering virtually every aisle and at least 1 or 2 crusty chairs. We finally found two safer seats on the side, one of which was missing an armrest. I kept my coat on as a protective shield. Granted, another couple there told us it is generally cleaner, and they thought the general disarray was a result of a missing manager. Perhaps I visited the worst theater of the bunch?Regardless, people were coming and going, talking, calling and generally being disrespectful throughout the film. Boo! Plus, the picture and sound quality reflected the price tag. 5% of the screen was cut off. Yep, my movie starred Chael Ouglas and Ia Bouf. I know. I know. It only costs 1.50/person, but 3.00 goes a long way at the Red Box. The Box accepts credit cards! And, my couch is not crusty, my screen is great, and I can watch in my PJs with a blanket. From what I have been seeing, the movie selection of recent has also been pretty uninteresting. Yes, it could be cool if they showed classic or cult films and put a little more effort into keeping the place nice or hip or cozy or anything besides not clean.  Maybe if you have kids, this is a great way to save money and take them out. Or, if you just have to escape your house, this could be an okay hiding spot. For me, watching from home will be my preferred cheap screening! In fact immediately following our evening here, we went to the Red Box and picked up a great foreign flick. Phew, that was better.
