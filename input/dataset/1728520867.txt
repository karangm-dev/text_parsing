One of my favorite places in Scottsdale to grab some pad Thai or shoji noodles and a Thai iced tea.  The place is set back in a strip mall setting. When you walk in you will notice the love of elephants because they are everywhere. The restaurant is kind of quiet but the service has always been excellent. I love that there is so many different Asian cuisines to choose from.  I had a taste of their Roger roll the last time I was there and was happy with the quality of sushi although not a large variety but still a good menu. The staff was very accommodating for my sister who is a vegetarian too. This is a great place to have a quiet intimate meal, business meeting, or group get together.
