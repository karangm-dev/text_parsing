"Sorry I'm taking so long to choose, it's just that I've never been able to eat EVERYTHING on the menu before!"  Quote from my wife as she looks over the menu at Green.  It's wonderfully refreshing to hear her say that (and feel that way myself) but that's the case at Green.  Burgers?  Sandwiches? Bowls?  All vegetarian/vegan?  Yes!  I had the "Big Wac" she the "Coconut Curry", both were very tasty and really hit the spot.  And the thyme fries?  Yeah, totally awesome.We live 3+ hours away but will be trying to stop in every time we venture down to Phoenix it's just that good.
