Slowest service ever. The waitress was unattentive. Took food away while I was still eating. My taco was cold. She slammed my plate down when after we asked what was taking so long. Since we waited two hours to get our food. And thirty minutes to get a drink. You'd get better service at Taco Bell. Don't bother.
