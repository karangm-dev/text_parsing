These guys are professionals and did an awesome job! We had a LOT of heavy and/or awkward furniture to move into a three story house. My husband had to work and was a little nervous leaving me to handle the move alone. Move Right showed up early, worked hard and was able to stay over the reserved time to get the job done (at additional hourly cost of course). The whole time they were incredibly respectful and kept sunny dispositions. They really know what they are doing, work well as a team and even bring all the pads, dollies, etc that are needed. I would highly recommend them to anyone!
