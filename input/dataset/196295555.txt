We were here around 12:00 pm and waiting for about 1 hr in line to get the pager. We got the number 27 and the server told us it takes about 60 mins to get the seat.   HOWEVER, the pager DO NOT have any response after almost 3 hrs. Therefore we decided go back to the reception to find the reason.   The receptionist extremely UNPROFESSIONAL and NO ANY APOLOGIES, even the guests before us already finished meal but definitely there is something wrong with the pager!   Even like this, they didn't give us any solutions and response, No apology and with cold face. We have to stand there about another 20 mins to get the seat!!!!Will NEVER EVER come back and do not want to pay the tips!
