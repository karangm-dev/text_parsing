Worst walmart in Phoenix. I hate that this is the most convenient location for me. Every time I go I leave exhausted, shocked, or irritated. The bathrooms are always a riot-no supplies, gross, etc. I was using the sink while someone was essentially karate chopping and punching the paper towel dispenser. People shopping have approached me or harassed me inside and outside the store. Last time I went it looked like the zombie apocalypse had happened because the parking lot bomb had gone off with carts and trash littered everywhere. There were more carts in parking spots than cars. Also, this particular walmart only has the bare minimum of barely human cashiers open. I've waited 20+ minutes for a quick stop late at night. I think there's just so many people rolling through this store acting like barbaric rabid filthy animals that the store cannot keep up. Avoid at all costs.
