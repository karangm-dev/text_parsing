Terrible terrible terrible. Not only can you not even get a car wash without being pestered into a detail, and once you decline the guy he's rude. Another guy comes up telling me my windshield is cracked and asking me about my insurance when I had already told them twelve times I just wanted a basic car wash because I was in a rush. My car then sat there for 20 minutes waiting to be dried while everyone was standing around talking. My car didn't even come out clean. Pretty frustrating and safe to say I won't be coming back.
