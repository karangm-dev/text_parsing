This is by far my favorite starbucks in Summerlin!!! I come in a few days a week to get an espresso before the gym, and the baristas are always nice - not just a few of them, but every barista I've ever encountered. Whether they're busy or slow, they have a great attitude and have always made my drink correctly (I add a little milk and a tiny bit of syrup - they always put the right amount!)None of the other starbucks in the area have the service that this store does - good thing it's right by my house, because I would want to go out of my way to get coffee here. FYI- there's no drive-thru.
