This is the worst place I have ever been to. They have terrible customer service and not enough staff. They made my mom wait an hour soaking her feet and no one ever attended to her. We walked out mad and my mom was unable to get a pedicure. They even continued to help people who came after to do their nails and kept saying it will be another 5 mins. I wish I looked at reviews before coming to this location. Heed my warning and go somewhere else!
