I would not be going back.. personally. I have followed Guy Fieri on "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives" and this was not my cup of tea. This restaurant represents his inner spirit I believe- a biker would love this place. I had just eaten at Gordon Ramsey Pub and Grill in Cesars Palace the night before and if I had the option between the two- thats where I would be going back! Here I had the "Shareables"- Sashimi Won-Tacos (sashimi-grade ahi tuna packed into crispy wonton shells with mango jicama salsa, sweet soy, scallions, wasabi cream) and Vegas Fries which I was so excited to try as they were featured on his show and it was his first popular recipe so it must be good right?... (crispy sidewinder fries tossed in spicy buffalo seasoning and topped with blue cheese crumbles served wit house made buffalo sauce and blue sari dipping sauce (which is a mixture of blue cheese and wasabi)). The Sushi Tacos, although an interesting concept, and seems as though they would have lots of flavor- had none! You would think they would be spicy with the wasabi but absolutely not. The salsa didn't even have any flavour. The fries were the opposite end of the spectrum they were TOO spicy and you couldn't even taste the blue cheese..
