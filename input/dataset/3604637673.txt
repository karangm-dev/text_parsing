Littering my neighborhood with stupid flyers stuffed into front doors is not welcome.  I called and asked for someone come remove the unsolicited flyers.  I was transferred to someone else who said it would be easier to just throw it away.  When I said I'd report it as littering as they were blown about the neighborhood, he said "I'd like to see how that goes for you."  That's a great way to earn business.These flyers are unwanted, a total waste and create a more negative brand impressions than positive.
