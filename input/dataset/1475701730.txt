Well Dr. Haymore did 2 root canals for me...one was fine the other i have had so many problems with. The root was not sealed so i have had pain for years (9 1/2). This root canal was 1 root canal, then a second one...and somehow 2 stitches were left in..that got so painful because i could not see them. Now i need to get the tip of another root done and finally sealed. I have spent years trying to figure out why my gum is always infected, and lost my back molar (behind this tooth)  I can say i am so far past frustrated...for this last one i am going to Urgent Dental.  On the upside neither root canal hurt at all. However years of pain made up for that.Yes you did a root canal as well as the one through the top. No i did not go to a competitor, actually 4 dentists...and one(Dr. Tratos) traced the problem and did a film of it.  The tip of this root is still there and has been infected now since being done 9 years ago.  Yes there were 2 black stitches left in...because they got infected....no competitor "from a FORD dealership" sold me the idea....I have had to press the infection out of the top of my gum for 9 years,...I have the traced film that clearly shows this was not sealed...the material clearly passes from root to outside of gum... While i understand you want to soft pedal around...I am not here to go tit for tat....at this point i am just trying to save what is left of this molar.  As i said i did not have any problems with the other tooth done in your office.
