This place has very poor customer service.  We went there for lunch, it was not busy was not greeted by a rude hostess that we were obviously an inconvieience to her.  She sat us at a table.  Other tablkes were being served and taken care of.  None if the customers in our section had anything to drink nor had placed their order.  After waiting for 10 + minutes we got up to leave , I spoke wiuyh another waiter concerning our service, he also did not seem to care.   This is one of the worst places I have been to ever.  I don't think they will be there long.  Save yourself some time and go to firebirds
