I kept going back, hoping it would be different... but this is the truth: the cupcakes have nothing special about them. For $3.75 each, I would expect them to use "better" or gourmet ingredients, but they taste too regular, too sweet, and even.. boring. I would rather cross the street to Sprinkles for a cute, tasty and satisfying $3.25 cupcake.However, they do have a good location for those who need a quick sugar rush while shopping. It is located right outside of Nordstrom on the 3rd floor.
