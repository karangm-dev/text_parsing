I had a great experience here shopping for a mattress.  I checked out several mattress and furniture stores looking for the perfect mattress at my price point.  This place definitely had the most options in the price range I was looking at.  Brian was very helpful in answering questions and I'd definitely recommend this location for any future mattress-buying needs!
