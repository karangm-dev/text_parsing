My wife and I came back last week Friday bringing our 15yo grandaughter. The place was again not crowed but that isn't unusual for Scottsdale when high school football is in season. Parking this time was good we were only a few steps away from the door.  We were seated instantly at the same table as last time.  Gil came over and chatted with us. Gil mentioned that we should park in the back alley and come in that way next time. (He reads the reviews). We order more extensively this time as we trusted how the food would be.  Again excellent excellent.is the best way to describe Indian food done correctly.  We again ordered medium with hot sauce on the side so we could bring it up to the level each of us liked individually. Gil's wife was there and we chatted and found out she was also originally from N. Cal.  If you like real Indian food done perfectly this is the place for you..  Again we ordered additional food to go so I could have it another day.
