I have never been more disappointed by the care I was provided with at MountainView Hospital. I asked to be paired with an OB-GYN that came especially recommended by a friend. Unfortunately that doctor was unavailable so I was paired with Dr. Howard. (I also was put into a residency clinic, which the front desk never informed me of.) I was diagnosed with hyper emesis for the first four months of my pregnancy and had to be hospitalized. During my hospital stay I had an allergic reaction to the medication I was administered. (Medication that contained an active drug that I was allergic to.) Then soon after Dr. Howard left the practice and I was passed around to three different doctors. The experience was horrible and the quality of care is non-existent. This hospital does not care for its patients nor their well-being. It's disheartening that this was the experience I had to go through during my first months of my pregnancy.
