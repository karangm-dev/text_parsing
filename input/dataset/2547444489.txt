I've had lunch at Umai four times and each time it has been outstanding!  Not a sushi lover so thoroughly enjoy the chinese menu. My favorite dish is Basil Shrimp with extra basil! We received excellent and personable service. Bobby was our waiter and made sure we were well taken care of. I live nearby so thrilled to find this excellent restaurant! HIGHLY recommend!
