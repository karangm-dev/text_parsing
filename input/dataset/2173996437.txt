First time there... Christopher's big cherry was apparently opened (found out later at home).... Claeys fudge was the worst fudge ever (pitched).... my wife bought the bulk taffy, and it was as old as the hills... On our way out I saw the owner and wanted my two boys to meet the guy since I see his picture on the ads... He walked right by us without saying a word. Looked very grumpy. Won't be going back.
