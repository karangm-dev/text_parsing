What a great company...John Kubacki came out himself! On Memorial Day! Of all days to have the air go out, mine had to go out on Memorial Day, when my family was gathered to enjoy my son being home on leave from the US Army for the holiday. The best thing? The work was diagnosed quickly, problem solved for less than $200! No charge for Holiday, in fact, John even gave a discount because we are a military family. Love the Orange work van, and the Rebel Charge Airhorn blast when they arrive and when they leave. Just a fun company, really nice people at the office and in person! NO HESITATION in using this company again! Well done Duke's! Well done! And, thanks for your support of our troops!Respectfully,A very cool and happy Chandler customer
