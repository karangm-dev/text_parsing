I can't say enough positive things about top shelf. I went to 4 other shops trying to get a place to do some custom work on my escalade. 2 shops said they couldn't and the others quoted me 4 times higher the price. Jeff did the research, found a solution that none of the other guys could find and had it installed in a matter of hours. Plus they even detailed my escalade (I have 2 toddlers so you can image the scope of cleaning they provided) and the outside looked as good as the $100 detail I normally do. I highly recommend this company to everybody. I wish I could give them 10 stars. They deserve it. Bringing my bmw in next!
