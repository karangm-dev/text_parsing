pizza is pretty descent. I was about to 're-order something I got before - the same exact thing and yet they're charging me $20 more..(yes, $20.00 more) they said their price are higher now...hmmm, I checked their price on the menu, asked the lady for price of their "anytime special" and the ones on the website ....still, its exactly the same one I have in my hand....they keep records of your order history at least they could've honored the price they've given me previously. Right?.. Yet, I  still placed my order one last time  but feeling sad because of this incident.... Plus, There's so much pizza choices around our place anyway. Message to the Buss. owner/manager, try to keep your customers....  (You just lost me, what about my in laws, my cousins, my aunt's and my best friends....who all lives 4 mile radius from your business?) Just a thought. Tip: be prepared to add $1.00 for credit card processing fee charge, $2.50 for delivery charge,  sales /food tax and ur tip for the delivery guy.Lastly, $1.00 misc. Charge for switching a tomato topping to spinach.Just order a pick up special if u want to save some money.
