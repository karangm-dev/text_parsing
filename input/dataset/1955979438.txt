I am becoming disappointed in Asahi. The last few times have been, not the greatest experience. As i mentioned in my earlier review, this is the go-to sushi place for me and my co-workers, as it is seconds from the office. Really though, the service is terrible lately. Not to fault the servers, as they are rushing like mad.. there just are not at all enough servers on. Three servers for two floors is ridiculous. The average wait times for meals has skyrocketed. Today we waited over 35 min for our meals. The sushi came out before the salads and miso soup "appetizers" and they completely forgot my Sriracha even though I asked for it Twice.My coworker ordered his sushi combo at the same time the rest of us did, and he never received it. 45 min later, our manager had to leave (after scarfing his meal rapidly in under 10 min) and sushi-less coworker was left waiting for his meal. When he flagged down the waiter, they had forgotten to enter it into the computer. Our manager paid for the entire team's bill, but our one coworker whose sushi was MIA was presented his own bill on the side. He complained, obviously, as it was not his fault that they had forgotten to put it on the company bill and asked if he could get any sort of discount. They refused. My $7 Hamachi sashimi was not the highest quality today and tasted very "frozen". Additional minus points for disposable chopsticks. Disappointed, as we have been there so many times.. but it really is getting considerably worse. New sushi suggestions for Y&B welcome!
