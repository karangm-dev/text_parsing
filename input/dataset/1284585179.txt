A few years ago I used Rick Campos to sell my home and I can only say he was unreliable and completely unprofessional. I felt like I had hired a new realtor with no experience and I was his first client. He was too lazy to send anyone to take pictures and requested that I supply any pictures I had, which were very few with no people in the rooms. He made numerous errors in the listing information and description of my home listing a 5 bedroom home as a 2 bedroom. I contacted him multiple times a day to get the information corrected (it never was). Needless to say the showings were terrible as people were expecting a much smaller home. We had 2 showings in a month. He ended up bringing me an offer, that was very low, almost insulting, from a buyer that he was also representing. I commented that I believed this was a conflict of interest so Rick brought his daughter who is also a realtor into the transaction to represent the buyer. Rick was insisting that the offer was excellent and that there wasn't a lot of interest in my property, maybe if he had the listing right there would have been. I lived in a very popular area with a modern, updated home, which was less than 10 years old. He pushed and rushed the transaction and I feel almost bullied into excepting an offer that years later still bothers me. What made me finally write this review was a conversation I had with my new neighbor who had just moved in next door. They were describing an almost identical experience with this same realtor, Rick Campos. How can we let this person keep doing this?
