Just what Charlotte needed!!! Such a pleasant surprise to find Vanessa and Blue Hem, this girl knows her denim.  I found them looking for Raleigh Denim, but noticed they also had 3x1, thought I might be the only person in Charlotte to know that brand but I guess I was wrong.  If you have a thing for denim this is the only place in Charlotte you need to go.  Such a nice surprise to find a place with raw, washes, different weights, etc most places around here may have one pair of selvege in a size 29 or something random, not here they have a full run of sizes in their denim!   Anyways I'm a novice denim snob and they had just what I was looking for, a must visit for jeans but you can find some other cool stuff too.
