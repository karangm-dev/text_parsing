I was in town scheduled to leave in a few days and in dire need of highlights.  I Yelped and found Joni.  She replied and booked me right away.  Very pleased with her technique, the products used and with the color results.  Charming salon too.  Don't hesitate to reach out to Joni; she knows her stuff!
