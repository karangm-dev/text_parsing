This was our first time eating Indian food and the whole staff made us feel really great about trying new things and helping us along the way.  The food was AMAZING!  We ordered the Tikka Masala and the Fish of the day and they were both very flavorful and super tasty!  We also tried the garlic naan which was out of this world!  We liked it so much we signed up for the rewards program because we will definitely be coming back!  I would totally recommend this great restaurant!
