Uh who messes up pancakes? Thin cold pancakes on which the butter would not melt. I had the special and it seems the pancake batter was old or over beaten, and she served them and the bacon cold. I usually opt to not eat here especially for breakfast BUT HOW DO YOU NOT MAKE FRESH PANCAKES WHEN YOU ONLY Have FOUR PATRONS DINING. NOT a good idea ...the replacement pancakes were hot thin and a bit raw. Boo
