I was visiting from out of town and wanted to see what was on offer here. Stopped by and grabbed a coffee, cause I'm always down for organic coffee. Asked for a coffee then decided an almond milk latte would be better. What did I get? A dairy milk latte. Not what I asked for, not what I wanted. I'll take the drive to Luna's in Charlotte next time, even if it's just for a drink.
