I visited Beltway for the first time during the Hunt for my first Handgun at the beginning of the year. From my very first interaction with Branden, I gathered that they are more honest and forthright than several that I had visited. They are well informed but might not have answers to all your questions. However, they would help search for the proper answer rather than mislead you. I have bought a few guns, several accessories and a Scope from here after (offcourse) doing my due diligence. I have been extremely satisfied with all my purchases.You can expect Friendly personnel, Reasonable prices and Great communication at Beltway.
