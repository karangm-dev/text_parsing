I like this Lee's. Its very conveniently located close to my home and they have pretty good wine selection. Today I wanted to buy just a cheap little bottle of wine and noticed they were having a closeout sale on the wine. So I figured that's harmless, they're probably trying to get rid of it BEFORE it goes bad. I get home after my purchase, taste the wine and all I tasted was straight vinegar. I poured all of it out, looked at my receipt and noticed the "all sales are final". Lee's should at least have some stipulation when it comes to that policy because I bought the wine to drink wine, not vinegar. I returned to the store to make another purchase, not on the closeout shelf, and mentioned to the cashier that the wine I bought was straight vinegar. He shrugs his shoulders, hands me my receipt and sends me on my way. Terrible customer service. But he really didn't look like he wanted to be there anyway. In conclusion, I just may boycott this Lee's and advise everyone who goes to choose carefully of what they buy if it's on closeout. Even if its not, beware.
