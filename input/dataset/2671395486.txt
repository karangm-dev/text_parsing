I wish a negative rating was possible...I still have not received my car. It has been sitting in a lot for nearly a month. Nearly every day I call and I am told the same thing "we are waiting to hear back from the dispatchers, call back around 4:30. I know they are trying their best to get it assigned ASAP" .... I continue to email and call my sales rep Bernie who assured me that I was making the right choice trusting them with my grandfathers 1995 Acura Legend. I leave him voicemails and have sent multiple emails and haven't heard from him since he took my payment information over a month ago. I emailed headquarters. I was told my vehicle was being marked as a priority and added to their Escalated list.. I am not sure this means anything, because today my loading date and estimated arrival date was pushed back yet again. I have no clue where to go next. If anyone has suggestions on what to do please let me know. I feel as though I am being strung along, and as far as I know, my car could be lost or even stolen. If you are even considering using this company DON'T. Their word means nothing. That is if you can even get them on the phone.
