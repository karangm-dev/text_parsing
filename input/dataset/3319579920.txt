I love that is off the strip and next to an indoor starbucks On a hot summer day really you won't even feel like driving out if you are already staying in the Rio.There is no wait, minimal crowd even during breakfast time. The service is a bit slow, i must saw. I never got my plates or utensils so just had eat of my hands or use my kids. OH wait, those are mine! That is what you'll be saying once you bite into their waffles or potatoes or whatever it is you ordered.  Silence is golden and so is the wonderful golden pancakes and syrup staring at me.. OH man.  Breakfast is the start of a great day.Portions are generous and frankly very shareable...but hey this is mine!! Even the hot cocoa was spilling with marshmallows and gooeyness.  I wonder if other chains are like that...but definitely will be back.
