Service is great! Food is absolutely delicious and the ambience is just perfect. My wife brought me  to dinner for Father's day and from start to finish the staff and food were just consistently great! Jason is the epitome of what a server should be! We will definitely  be back! The rack of Lamb and Halibut are cooked perfectly! Seared Ahi as an appetizer and you will not go wrong
