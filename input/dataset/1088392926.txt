Totts, our go to take out Chinese and it's oh so dang good! We stumbled upon Totts on the Door Dash app when we moved back to Chandler. I am beyond scared to try small, shopping center, Chinese because I'm very sensitive to MSG and dairy. To my surprise this place was not only delicious but I did not get sick. We have ordered Totts about 10 times and every time it's always hot and delicious. Our go to order is Mongolian Beef and Sweet and Sour Chicken (it's seriously award winning!!). If you choose to go in and dine, the people that work there are so friendly. It's just a great family operated business. The pricing is amazing too, very fair and far less expensive than other "faster food" restaurants.
