There's a lot of dessert places in the area, but their aesthetic presentation really blew me away! Everything they bring out is instagram worthy. Also, the pricing is competitive (in the field)I got the perfect parcel crepe, which was a brownie, vanilla gelato wrapped in a crepe with walnuts, strawberries and lots of chocolate drizzle. My only complaint is the crepe was kind of tough. My friend got the C'wow (the coveted melting chocolate dome!) so props to them for offering it first. Lots of footage to share.
