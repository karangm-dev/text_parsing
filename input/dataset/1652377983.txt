What a pleasant and attractive place with great food.  My wife and I have been here 4 or 5 times in the past couple of years and have always received great food and courteous service.  I can vouch for the quality and taste of their meat, fish and sides.  You get wonderful dishes, large portions, cooked perfectly, according to your instructions.  Not only do they make their meat and fish dishes to excel, but you can't improve on .the flavor or consistency of any of their side dishes, making the veggies sing and dance in your mouth and their desserts take a curtain call!  Add reasonable prices to it all and you will have a wonderful and memorable repast at Fleming's.  You can't miss and they won't either.
