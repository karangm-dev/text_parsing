Decent food. Too bad I couldn't enjoy it because of the loose strand of hair in my spicy bulgogi. We went for my daughter's 15th birthday, as she adores the Korean culture. So, of course we were looking forward to a peaceful, delicious meal. ..but that hair...ughhhh! Just RUINED the entire experience. I know things like this happens..but nonetheless, it was disgusting. Will I go again...? Maybe. But I'd definitely try to find a different spot first. They were really friendly and apologetic about the incident. They offered me a free drink; but I declined. Not sure if they knocked the price down from my total..I think I got a discounted price. I don't know..I wanted to pay and leave. #bummer Aside from that- nice and clean environment, overly priced food-but hefty servings and great K-Pop music on the television. My children did enjoy their meals.
