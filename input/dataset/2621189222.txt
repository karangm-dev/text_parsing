For a fast food place, I really enjoy their food. Their California style burgers are amazing. The few times I feel like having fast food, this place comes to mind because of the quality and service. When I first moved to Vegas- I always wanted to try places I didn't have in my previous location. This was one of the first food spots I tried and it hasn't let me down since. In addition to their burgers... their desserts, French fries, and dipping sauces are delicious. If you're into dipping sauces, try their fry sauce and their jalape√±o fry sauce. You won't be disappointed!
