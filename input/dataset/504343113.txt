I have been using Steven Vogt for the past 4 years.  They used to be down the street from my house, but have since moved.  I continued to use them as they did supply good service, and I felt I got value for my money.  This year, my experience was drastically different! I completed their tax organizer as requested.  The Tax Preparer sat with me for 5 MINUTES! He asked 1 question and I explicitly told him about a big change with my business.  5 minutes after my appointment, I got a survey request, where I expressed my concerns, but did not hear from anyone.  1 week later I go to get my taxes, and sure enough, there were mistakes (A tax preparer who used ASSUMPTIONS!). They were good, but have grown and they lost the personal touch.  I fail to see how they are any different than Turbo Tax (other than price).  I fill out my organizer, they fill out some paperwork and electronically file it.  Last year using them.
