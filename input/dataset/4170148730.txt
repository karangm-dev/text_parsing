Remember when you were a kid, pinball was such an awesome game? Then came the xboxs and playstations of the world and you got over it. But sometimes you just wanna reminiss and see true craftsmanship in a game that wasn't done on a computer. So you head to the Pinball hall of fame. Now saying they have a lot of pinball games would be a total understatement. They have every pinball game I could ever remember playing when I was a kid and then a ton more that were made before I was even born.There was one game that was like air hockey but with pinball where you played against one of your friends and the board tilted back and forth. granted it was super slow, but it was a really cool interesting thing. Even the gumball machine is a pinball game, so when you lose, you actually win because then you get your pinball. Love this place, made me feel good inside just being there.
