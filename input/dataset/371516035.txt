As the owner of a car hauler that uses mobile home tires, I was horrified on a hauling trip to walk around my trailer and find a tire missing on one axel. After exhausting leads in tire stores to get this unusual tire INCLUDING the rim, I started randomly calling mobile home companies and Kathy answered my call at 7:30AM on a Saturday AM after the holidays.  I explained that I needed an entire tire, rim and all, and could not seem to get ahold of one.  Kathy assured me that she WOULD get me a tire and before 10AM, the retired owner(?) of the company, Bill, told me to stop by and get my tire.  When my friend and I arrived, Bill was able to diagnose why my tire had fallen off (they need to be torqued to 100PSI and mine had not and wobbled off), and he helped us install the tire, substituting one of his rim clamps for a bad one of ours. He then checked the torque of my other bolts, gave me a nifty tip about using spray paint to check if there's slippage on the tire rim, checked and filled all my tires and took us on a tour of other options with those tires.  Bill gave us not only his time but his expertise, and he also suggested some other safety fixes that I should have  my home-town trailer shop look at.  Bill had obviously come in on his day off, but he took the time to really make sure that we were safe on our trip and knew how to keep ourselves from having that problem again.  Highly recommend!!!! - Wendy from Snowflake
