Little gem tucked away in Pilgrim Square mall, close to 750ML wine bar.  I picked up divine individual creme brulee and tart-sized apple/cranberry/walnut pies for a small dinner party. I ogled the beautifully decorated cakes on display and pictures of their creative cakes (including wedding cakes).  They also carry vegan cakes and other desserts.  A great local bakery with a small lunch & breakfast menu (that I must try).
