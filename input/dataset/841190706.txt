I start this review during the long wait for my sandwich. So far my experience is negative. I knew exactly what I wanted though the cashier couldn't get it right. When he asked if I wanted mayo, mustard or Italian dressing I replied Italian. Then when he said "so you want everything". I repeated no that I did not want mustard or mayo. At this point the guy in line though he would jump in and educate me on how to order a sandwich. I have some angry words that I am holding back from my review about this guy. I told him I knew what I was doing and he continued to mettle. I told him to stop. I finalized my order and was trying to pay when the cashier instead turned to ask the guy behind me what he wanted because he assumed we were together!!! 30 minutes wait and my sndwich arrives. The bread was delicious and all was fresh. Not enough cheese though. The menu should list that the sandwich I ordered is comprised of the spicey hot meat. It was not as I expected. The bread was yummy.  Overall though I have had better thus the two star rating.
