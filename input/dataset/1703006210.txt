So highly rated yet really disappointing.Named one of the top 10 Chinese restaurants in America by Travel + Leisure magazine and  "Best Asian Restaurant in Las Vegas" six times by readers of the Las Vegas Review-Journal? Really? They sure did not sparkle on 8/13/13. My date said "They must be resting on their laurels".The food was just ok. Nothing special there. The floor was sticky. Gnats buzzed around our table all visit. Uniformed employees ate at the table next to us.The thing that stuck in my mind is the terrible service. The (Spanish?) server who took our drink order did not know the name of the only chardonnay on the menu. Our meal server never returned to ask us if everything was ok. In fact she disappeared for good after our order was placed. Eventually we had to flag down some one who was serving other tables in our section to help us. It is not like they were over busy at 8pm on a Tuesday night.I even passed on dessert, completely un-heard of for me, due to the lack of attention we received.
