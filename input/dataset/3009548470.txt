The food is amazing. They make their eggs taste insanely good. I've never had eggs anywhere else taste even remotely as good. The banana nut muffins are a must have. They are so buttery and they just melt in your mouth.  They have an awesome sausage patty that is like old school mcdonalds on crack. They also make a delicious BLT
