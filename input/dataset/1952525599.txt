Staff was very helpful, but you could see the stress and several customers complaining. Some of the rules are very bad for customer service relationships.  1. Standing in line for gaming card, most places have free standing machines that take your money and give you a card. 2. Standing in line for Id check and beer, with empty bar seat next to it dumb.3. Saturday and Sunday when you make your most money, you need more staff 4. Less staff durning weekend means sticky tables and lost repeat business.
