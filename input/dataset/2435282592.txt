DAS IS NOT LIABLE FOR UNDERCARRIAGE DAMAGE. The bumper, splash guard and inner wheel well lining were torn apart when I got my car back. Clearly, DAS did not take caution to avoid bottoming out. Their employee was rude over the phone. One star is given for DAS emailing me to review them. Thanks for the reminder! ;)
