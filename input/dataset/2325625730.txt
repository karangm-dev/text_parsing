My AC guy Bill, with this company is AWESOME!  The rates have always been fair and he is always honest with what is wrong taking time to show me exactly what the problem is.  I have been with this company about 10 years now.  Since I'm a single woman now it is scary what company to go with in these areas and I have always been treated well.  One weekend about three years ago the dreaded summer situation finally happened to me.  Mid-day on a Saturday POOF!!! No air, No more.......  I called Bill, voice shaking thinking the worst and he said "I'll be right over".  What a great guy.  Fortunately it wasn't the whole unit dead only something else. Their prices are reasonable and I appreciated that he was compassionate to drop what he was doing and come over on a Saturday and get my AC working again.
