So I'm not the kind of fan that is a walking advertisement, unless I'm at the ball park.  But my amazing hair stylist said he would "just die" for anything from the Elton John Store emblazoned with "The Bitch Is Back".  Having just seen The Red Piano for the second time, I made a point of going into the store filled with all things Elton to pick up a gift for the magician that keeps my tresses so soft and red.  No problem locating the desired item, the problem was that surprisingly, I found things I wanted as well!  This store is filled with seriously high quality things, like the t-shirt I just had to have.  Beautiful soft cotton, perfect fit,  maybe the best t-shirt I've ever had!Washes up great, didn't get all short and boxy looking like t-shirts so often do, you girls know what I mean!Seriously, next time you're at Caesars, wander in here.....if you like Elton John at all, you WILL find something you have to have!
