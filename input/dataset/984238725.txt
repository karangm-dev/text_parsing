Just left this location and was asking about prices, they said they had a incident with a mastiff and if they board mine he'd be in a cage all day. So because our dog is a mastiff he'd not get any socialization and would be in a cage all day... please do not take your pets here, if I could give zero stars I would!In response:You should better educate your staff members, due to that is not what they told me and my husband when we visited your location today!
