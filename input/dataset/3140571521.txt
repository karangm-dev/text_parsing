This Starbucks is the slowest that I have seen in awhile but, the service of the staff is amazing. This Starbucks has the vibe of ones past that have surrendered the customers experience, but it's alive here and it is not fake. It's funny this Starbucks is in a touristy area but it is better for the service than most local neighborhood stores.
