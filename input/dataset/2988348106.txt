I called to get put on the waiting list before I headed in. When I called I was told they don't have a waiting list but I can make an appointment. I told him I would like to avoid waiting if possible so he told me to come on down no problem and they will get me right in. I was there within 5 minutes and was told there was an hour and a half wait before they could get me in. Something they should've told me before saying come on down we will get you right in. Poor customer service and lack of communication on their part.
