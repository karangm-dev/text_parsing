So, this place is no longer my fav.  They messed up my order a few times, but the straw that broke the camels back is as follows:  there was a mix up with delivery services and my condo, and long story short we got someone else's Lucki Thai.  We called to let them know so they could redeliver the food to the right person, and they asked if we could REPACKAGE the food and deliver it ourselves... umm what? That is just weird and could lead to an unsanitary situation.  Gross.
