OK, this place has only been open a week. However, if it wants to be known as a "steakhouse," it will be competing with Mastro's, Fleming's, Grill 44 and Ruth's Chris among others. Measured alongside these restaurants, Black & Bleu's management has a lot of work to do.The menu is a little bit of this and that. It creates the impression that this eatery has an identity crisis. Most steakhouses will bring out a basket of warm bread or rolls. At Black & Bleu, we had to ask for bread THREE times. In the end, we were brought two slices of toasted white sandwich bread more suitable for toast points than anything else -- and with NO butter. All this in a "steakhouse" charging $44 for a 14 oz ribeye and $42 for lamb chops.The wine list is relatively small and mediocre, There are a number of cabernets and pinot noirs but only one merlot. On the bright side, the barmaids are easy on the eyes and the broiler station knows their stuff. Our flatiron steak and NY Strip came out exactly as we ordered. That said, the Lobster Bisque was scorched and the grilled asparagus was limp. In the restaurant world, it's inexcusable to serve your patrons burned soup.Service was needlessly slow. The waitstaff does not know the menu. Example: they constantly referred to "crabcakes" when, in fact, the dish was a single crabcake. The entire waitstaff needs to be trained in the basics. Yes, Virginia, diners should be served from the left and plates removed from the right. The waitstaff has yet to master this basic tenet of service. See: www.chefalbrich.com/etiquette/ In sum, the menu needs to be rethought and the staff trained in proper service. Until that time, competing as a "steakhouse" in a market that has so many first-class steakhouses will doom Black & Bleu.
