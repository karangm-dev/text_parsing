Over-priced and under-cared for, the Sport Center is a memorial to what could have been if Vegas residents used this place or if the owners took care of it.  The building houses a Cross-Fit gym, batting cages, climbing wall and basketball court.  The basketball court is in great condition and is used for basketball camps.  The climbing wall is decent, but there's no marked climbs and the cost is pretty ridiculous ($8 a climb v. $10 a day in another climbing gym).  I went for the batting cages which have a great set up with a mock field and mock home run background.  However, the machines are old and not maintained well (4 out of every 14 pitches are low or deeply inside).  The batting cage cost is a little high too ($2 for 14 pitches).  This place could be amazing with the fake field and wall, but the poorly maintained machines and bad pitching ruin the place.All in all, this place is a monument to what could be an amazing local sports place/community center.  Instead, it's just a rundown place with moments of genius.
