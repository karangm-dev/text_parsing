This place has the worst wings. Few years back my friends and I would frequent a few times a week. But after the renovation before the fire. The prices went up over 3 bucks for a dozen wings. Plus the wings are horrible, as if they get them from KFC. I wish they would go back and purchase quality wings. My advice, go to Doc & Eddy's in tempe. Those wings are amazing and only $8 per dozen. Order them grilled, you will thank me.
