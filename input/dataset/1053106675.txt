Love the Peppermill! I love the old school vibe of the Fireside lounge, it is not a pounding music blaring nightclub, its a place to hang out enjoy a drink in a comfy booth and still have a conversation or cuddle!Hubby and I enjoyed a cocktail and appetizer platter was way more food then we could eat as a midnight snack!Loved the Watatini (watermelon martini) very yummy! can't wait to go back and try all the rest!Yes for the 20 something set it may seem old or not the "in" thing but we think its a great place for a date or a nice evening with your sweetie!
