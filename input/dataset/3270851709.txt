I have been a client at Glo Medspa for over year, mainly for botox.  Yesterday, I saw Megan for micro-needling.  Megan did a great job!   She was very thorough with her explanation of the procedure, attentive  and highly professional.  I would certainly recommend Megan if you're searching for an aesthetician.
