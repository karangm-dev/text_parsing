I have been on a quest, since moving to Arizona, to find NY Style Pizza. Other places just add "NY Style" to their storefront, but fail to deliver. I tried 1 slice with Xtra cheese and meatballs...and I literally pictured myself walking in NYC eating a slice of NY Pizza. They delivered on their claim and the service was wonderful! Two thumbs way up!
