Ordered delivery... told 1 hour. 2 hours later, they claim they came to my work and it was closed, tried calling, and no one answered. Weird, because i work in a 24 hour hospital and the phones go through me. So had someone called or come to the door... would have seen it. Finally another hour later, they showed up with my meal. Philly was cold and stale and the fries were also cold and soggy. I'm sure it could have had potential but that disappointing 3 hour wait made me feel gross trying to eat it. Plus, you Shouldnt eat food that has been sitting at room temp that long.
