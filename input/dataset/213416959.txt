Casablanca Express did everything they said they were going to do in a timely manner. They even offered us an upgraded hotel stay at a fraction of what it would've cost us if we had tried to book the reservations on our own. We were even able to use the $50 deposit we paid towards the cost of upgrading the hotel, which I didn't even know we could use that. We had a wonderful experience with Casablanca Express & also had an amazing trip to Disneyland, where we were able to take our 2 small children for the very first time (while we also had one on the way!) Aces all around! Great job Casablanca Express! We were extremely pleased with our interaction with this company.
