We made reservations for Thursday evening at 6:15 and upon arrival were immediately seated though we were 15 minutes early.Within a 1/2 hour the restaurant was packed. We were a party of 3, wife, mum and myself. The waiter quickly brought us a wide variety of breads and some butter. We ordered some waters and I checked in for the free glass of white wine.We looked at the happy hour menu and decided on a couple appetizers: the meat balls with gravy, garlic lemon bread crumbs and buretta, and then the bucatini which came with basil pesto, charred zucchini and pecorino Romano cheese. The two meatballs were very tender and covered with plenty of sauce, we actually used the leftover sauce to dip the bread into. The bucatini tasted refreshing and light, the thicker noodle combined with the pesto was a nice combination.For the entree's we chose the pappardelle bolognese which came with san marzano, pancetta and a red wine sauce. The pappardelle noodle is house made fresh daily, is very thin and combined with the aforementioned sauce was superb. My mum ordered the wild mushroom risotto accompanied by mascarpone, truffle butter and chives and topped with spinach and a mix of vegetables. Delicious was her response.Service was very good, they are very attentive and with a mention of my wife's birthday, they were quick to bring out a tiramisu topped with chocolate shavings and a candle with a couple of chocolate dipped cookies. Tim to the last spoonful. The perfect way to finish a great meal. We will be back again. Thank you Bottiglia!
