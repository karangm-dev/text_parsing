Great product of course but that is not the problem.  Cashiers!   Can your hire some?  I've been at this store three different times since thanksgiving and the lines are at least six people deep.   I put down my purchases and left.  I guess I am impatient but i would rather not wait that long.  Get your multi staff on the floor check out devices so that they can ring a customer out! Or add another register at the front.
