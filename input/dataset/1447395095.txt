I have been there twice (so far) and both times have been great experiences. Excellent service from each and every staff member. Courtney in particular was great, very professional but also funny.Appetizers are very interesting and are good sized portions, enough to share between 2 or 3 folks.Miso servings are generous & very satisfying. Food has a light healthy taste to it, i had PLENTY to eat but didn't leave feeling stuffed.
