Thought I would give them another try... Mistake! Waited over 30 minutes when I HAD AN APPOINTMENT!  The nail tech claimed she had 16 years experience, but did a less then professional job. After the 3rd attempt to get a simple design down I gave up correcting her. Polish on my cuticle and under my nail. Uggg, hate paying for work that my granddaughter would have done better and she is 9!Next time it will NOT BE THIS PLACE!
