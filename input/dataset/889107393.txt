Yardbird is a great restaurant in the Venetian providing some great upscale southern cuisine.I was sold the moment I saw the fried green tomato BLT online prior to visiting. My initial plan was just to stop in for a few pieces of chicken and some fried green tomatoes but ended up ordering a mini feast for myself. Going through the menu I saw cheddar waffles...CHEDDAR WAFFLES!!! with spiced watermelon and chicken. I'm use to the traditional chicken and waffles so I had to give these waffles a try and I was blown away. DELICIOUS!!! Adding maple syrup to the waffles didn't take away from the cheddar flavor mixing quite well. I glanced at another table and saw the mac and cheese so of course I wasn't leaving without ordering some also.Funny story for kicks. I came to Yardbird after drinking on the strip with a friend and ended up going into the restaurant next to Yardbird thinking it was Yardbird before realizing it wasn't. Ordered drinks and everything only to have to leave and go next door. This actually gave a couple of staff members who were very nice by the way at Yardbird a good laugh when telling the story.Glad I finally made it to the correct restaurant and will be paying future visits because those chicken and waffles are awesome.Dinner 2/12/2015
