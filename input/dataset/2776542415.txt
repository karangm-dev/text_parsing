Amazing food and service! We ordered a causa de tuna, tiraditos, a chaufa, and a couple of desserts! We loved everything especially the tiraditos! The sauce was amazing. The causa de tuna was a definite favorite too. The chaufa was delicious and had plenty of shrimp and chicken in it. We liked the desserts as well but I would recommend their ice cream over the flan for sure.
