Don't waste your money or your time. Super disappointed. Horrible service, food less then mediocre. There were only 6 tables, I had to bus my table. We were only non-white people, not sure if that was factor. Taco plate definitely not worth $11. We ordered chicken tacos, veggie tacos, green Chile burger and flautas. So, we tried a variety of items. Not a lot to choose from. Not worth it. Go somewhere else.
