This is a great place.  Friendly and inviting staff.  Maybe a block and a half from the convention center and an easy walk even in June.  The rooms are new and very clean and, the food is surprisingly yummy good  Next time, I will stay opposite pool side so as to avoid the thumping good times by those six floors below.  I know the staff would would have moved me but, if I were some years younger or in much better shape, I would probably joined everyone poolside.  Thank you Palomar staff for a really great stay.
