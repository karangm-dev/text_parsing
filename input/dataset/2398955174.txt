I used to buy stuff at this Booster Juice all the time. But like many places I frequented, it's under new management now. And the people who run this joint now don't seem to really care for the quality of their "juice". I got the Matcha Monson once & the taste was just awful. Most recently I got the Soy Milk Slam & man did I ever get sick! I don't know if they didn't check the expiration date on the soy milk or what. I won't come back here again unless the owners change again.
