Curry Pot is conveniently located in the Venetian but the food quality is below average. We ordered a veg thali and got a naan, rice and daal with side of salad. The naan tasted like it was frozen. You can get much better Indian food at India Masala which I just left a review for. Be prepared to wait about 20 mins to get the food.
