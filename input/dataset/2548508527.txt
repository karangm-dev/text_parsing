Why did I give this place one star...a. I ordered a medium rare cause I'm low on iron (yay pregnancy) it came out medium..barely any pink. The man ordered medium and it was medium well so it wasn't a mistake. b. chili was so dry and lacklusterc. $30 bucks for to subpar burgers, fries and a shakeYou should trythe bacon milkshake, which does taste like apple jacksthe spicy pickles from the pickle bar.
