Visited here today on a whim and I'm glad I did. I was worried they were going to be expensive but was pleasantly surprised. I had the falafel wrap deluxe (falafel w/2 slices of fried eggplant and fries) and my husband had the chicken schnitzel. The restaurant was clean and the staff was pleasant. Everything we had was tasty. I have had falafel in quite a few restaurants in AZ and this is by far the best yet! Also, the eggplant was cooked to perfection and served hot so the texture was still spot on. My husband was just as happy. The chicken was breaded evenly and it was fried up perfectly, nice and crispy breading! As a bonus they gave us a sample of their potatoes and meatballs. Quite good and probably what our little guy will order when we come back! Definitely, worth giving a chance if you want to try some place new. :)
