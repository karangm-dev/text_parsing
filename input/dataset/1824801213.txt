I was looking for somewhere to eat on Yelp and after reading a few of the Yardbird reviews I wanted to try it out! They were out of reservations for the night, so the next day I was able to obtain a reservation through Open Table for a party of 2.We arrived for our 8:15pm reservation and were promptly taken to to our table.Out knowledgeable server, Kenneth, gave us a great run down of the entire menu.For a table of two we ordered the following to share:Mac N Cheese: It was super cheesy and amazing we had it come out first like a mini appetizer.Short Ribs: They came with green beans, corn, and mashed potatoes. This meal was good but didn't compare to the chicken.Chicken and Waffles with Watermelon: Order this! The chicken was so moist and flavorful. The watermelon added something different and the waffles and bourbon syrup were great also! The portion was pretty large.Overall it was a great experience! The food, service, and ambiance made it a nice relaxing evening! Tips: Call early for a reservation! If they say they are booked for the night check Open Table!Order several entrees and share! The portions are pretty large and the food is very rich.
