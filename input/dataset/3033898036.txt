Great spot. Out of town from Portland Oregon. Came in late and hungry and a worker named Angelo greeted us and served us really well. He was attentive, patient and polite with everything we needed. We ended up sticking around later than we planned and he was still super courteous. He made our experience worth it and we plan on coming back for sure.
