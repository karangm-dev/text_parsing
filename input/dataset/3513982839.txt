OMG NO!   Beyond disgusting.  I can't even begin to  describe the filth. Stained curtains?   Really?   Black mold in the ice maker?  There were a pile of towels in the hot tub and a puddle of vomit next to the hot tub until about 3pm the day following.  The most horrific, gross, place I've ever had the misfortune of staying.  Ugh.
