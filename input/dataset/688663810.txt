okay...it's been quite a while since my last review.  I appreciate the owner feedback and had meant to get back sooner.  Again, I came for lunch with a coworker and I must say the food was very, very good.  As was the service.I'll start with the service, first.  We got there about 20 minutes before noon.  This was good as the place started to really fill shortly after we were seated.  The hostess was friendly and seated us right away.  The waiter arrived shortly and was very polite.  He clearly new the menu, ingredients, and great recommendations.   My only complaint, if I had one, would be maybe a little TOO much attention.  It wasn't bad - not "hover-bot" but, put it this way, we KNEW he was paying attention to us and wanted us to enjoy the food.  No, I did NOT tell him I was reviewing the food.  I observed similar treatment at other tables.  Service was also classy, always serving and addressing my female coworker first.Food choices - I had the Jambalaya and my colleague had the barbecue chicken platter.  Unlike my previous experience, the portions were sized very nicely for lunch.  We both finished but, barely.  At another restaurant, I might have left some food behind but, it was too yummy.  The flavors, peppers, spice in the Jambalaya were very well balanced though, a bit on the "low heat" side for me.  That said, the server offered, before I even asked, to provide a variety of pepper sauces, which I took him up on.And, my biggest pet peeve in a restaurant?  NEVER NEVER NEVER make a customer WAIT TO PAY!  The waiter's timing was very appropriate, friendly, and even inviting us to stay after paying the check.  Prices were quite reasonable.A really nice experience.  Will definitely come back.  Nice Job.Hint:  Plan on showing up EARLY and, if you have ANY size of a group, make a reservation.
