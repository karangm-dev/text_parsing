I was referred to AW by the Honda Dealership after some stupid lady decided to hit my driver door while I was parked at the Greenland Korean Market. Tom was the adjuster that I worked with during my initial visit, and he was more than able to get me a quote even though I just walked in the door right before they closed. During the entire process, Tanya kept me updated on the status of my repairs. Although there some delays, none of them were AW's fault. They made sure that everything was done the right way. Their customer service was very good. More than I expected from a collision shop given all the horror stories I hear from people. I highly recommend this place to anyone who needs their cars repaired.
