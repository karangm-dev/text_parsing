Sat down ordered water and a Arnold Palmer and got tea and a lemonade mix for mixed drinks. Very sour!   Got are "Meats" and as they progressed they got more and more salty. The lamb I didn't finish b/c it was so bad...  If less salt I think it would of been better. Used Restaurant.com and the manger tried to say he wouldn't except are coupon from the website.... Was $45!!!! A plate... Insane and not worth it by any means for 45$ a plate! $20 a plate would still be high.... Will not return here and I recommend you go ELSE where!!
