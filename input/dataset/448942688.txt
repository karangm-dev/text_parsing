Wasn't overly impressed with the food or beer selection. Being named "the French quarter", my husband and I were expecting French inspired food. It's run of the mill pub like food. I had the grilled chicken gryo that was ok and my husband had the corned we'd sandwich. Both looked delicious as they were served to us but there wasn't much in the way of flavor.
