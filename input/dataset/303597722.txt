This place deserves more reviews!! I came here because the bf had laos friends who lived in Vegas while we were visiting. We now come here every time we go to Vegas, even taking taxi from the strip if we have to! It's a market with basic necessities and a small togo area with little seating in the back (maybe 10 seats). I'd never had Laotian food before this place, and I've tried one more after this place in Hawaii but it doesn't top this place! I LOVE the beef larp dish and papaya salad here. So damn delicious and medium spicy is perfect for me. I recently tried the Nam Kuao dish and I'm in love.... Their Thai iced coffee is also super yummy and perfectly sweet. I wish there were Laotian restaurants in San Jose!! ):
