Nook is the place to go and hang out and eat delicious and when i mean DELICIOUS, the food is Delicious on so many levels! But let's start from the beginning, when you walk in the hostess welcomes you with a smile so pleasant, sits you down and for the first couple of minutes you just stare at all the amazing architectural of this resturant, which is vintage,yet modern. Our Server Jason welcomes you and hands you the menu and asks if you have any questions. Looking at the menu is very easy to see why this is their second location. The food was  spectacular.  I ordered the Monroe Burger, really didn't know what to expect, since it was my first time. But when it came out our whole table reacted in "OMG that's a huge burger". I was stunned! The Monroe Burger was more than i had expected in a burger, soooooo many flavors, so many textures, it really took me on a culinary experience all in one bite!! Nook is the only place that i have been to that a burger takes me on a culinary mouth-watery adventure. And will highly recommend it to anyone! So do yourself and your stomach a favor and go try this amazing place. And on top of that the people make you feel at home, just in a fancier/yet casual way and you are supporting a great local business!!Thank you Nook for a WONDERFUL experience! Surely will go again!!
