Not much to analyze....this is more Sysco slop straight off the truck.  Minimal prep required with minimal generic taste to match.  Salads drowned in dressing with the dressing full of enough MSG to swell your ankles up for a week.Dazzling array of beers tempered by the knowledge that half of them aren't very good.  Must echo the review on this page noting that checking IDs of people obviously well beyond age 21 insults the intelligence of all concerned and tends to sour the relationship with the bartender from the word go.  Smug buttons with 'We ID everybody' don't compensate for legal overkill, intellectual laziness and a lack of common sense.Too many of today's parents of young children believe that any place serving food is fair game for the little darlings even if the establishment in question is primarily a bar.  One mother, who apparently was an employee but off-duty, brought the little heathen 'Crawford' (groan) over to sit him on the bartop where he grabbed straws and napkins out of the caddy and hurled them in random directions.  Of course, mom thought this was adorable - adults trying to enjoy an adult beverage somewhat less so.I don't smoke but perhaps a rethink of smoking bans is warranted if it prevents every establishment from becoming a branch of Chuck E. Cheese.it's a shame that local places have fallen prey to the same assembly line mentality as their corporate competition.  Duckworth's tastes like Chili's tastes like Applebee's tastes like Friday's.   Given that all are buying the same raw materials from the same vendor this shouldn't be a surprise but it is nevertheless discouraging trying to find a place where they actually use recipes rather than reading directions on the side of a box.  The quest continues.
