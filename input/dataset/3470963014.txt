This place impressed me. It is in kind of a bad location not noticeable from the street on Pleasant Valley and Broadview road however through word-of-mouth I've heard about this place and when I went... Wow. Some of the best sushi I've ever had, The Chinese food on the menu was much better than 90% of the Chinese places in the area.  The quality of the food was exceptional. I keep on craving this place but just haven't got back yet. I will be back for sure
