Love this store.. The Fashions are up to date of of high quality. Nothing over 2.99.. Located at the corner of Rainbow and Oakey...Strange thing is, I was on my way to another store when I saw this one.  It had everything from children's clothing to clothing for adult of different ranges.   Their maxi skirts are very conservative and of a variety.There are sweatsuits, legg'm, stretch pants, sleeveless tops, sheer tops, shoes, even costume jewelry.  Jewelry ranges from bulky to dinky.  Shoes are sandals to sling backs.Now it's be about a year since I've been there.  You may want to take a look for yourself and bring me up to date.
