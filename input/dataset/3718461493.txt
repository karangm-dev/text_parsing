Don't order anything other than the Creps.  Everything else is too over priced for the microwave quality food.  You are safe with the crep because the girl makes it in front of u and it made to order.  Oh and their juices suck too.  The orange juice had a hint of rotten.   Don't even ask how much I paid for that, you'd call me stupid.
