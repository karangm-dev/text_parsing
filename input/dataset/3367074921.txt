The worst pedicure I've ever had! 15 minutes and my SPA pedicure was done. They have no clue on what they are doing... Usually I prefer to keep silent if I don't like something.  I only praise and if I have nothing to praise ... oh well... I hope next time I will have a better experience. .. But this time it exceeded all the limits! Beware! !! If you are planning to waist your time and money that is the place to go.
