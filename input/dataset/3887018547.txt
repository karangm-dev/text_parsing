*Red flag when the pharmacy technician confuses acetaminophen for psudoephedrine. So dropped off a prescription at 2pm on Thursday was told 1 hour. Went back at 5:30 and was told that the prescription was written wrong and that they need to get a hold of our doctor but since it was after 5 there was nobody in the doctor's office. Why they waited until 5:30 to call is frustrating as well as not calling me to let me know. Now it's Friday 1:45 p.m. and they still have not contacted the doctor and im On my way out of town without my daughter's meds.
