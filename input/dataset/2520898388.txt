I will rate this establishment due to their process in getting people to come buy a timeshare. They tell you the process will last 2 hours. We were there for 3.5 hours and some of the people told us they had been there for 5 hours. They started off by offering us a deal for 44k, then 15k, then the last offer before we actually got to leave was for 5K. At the end of the day, we waited for 20m for a shuttle to come and pick us up and it never showed up. Many of us took an uber instead. Funny- they were so ready to get us there on time but zero courtesy in getting us back home on time. The sales guys doesn't even give you a chance to think about the offer in private. They are just nonstop yapping. I feel bad for the people who actually stay here because it would be a pain in the butt to deal with tons of people they're trying to scam coming in and out of the building! Even the goodies you guys gave us were a joke. There were many different rules the casino told us about when using the chips. You guys are a**holes. Go get real jobs. Who the hell comes on vacation to spend 40k without given the time to research or discuss with families?
