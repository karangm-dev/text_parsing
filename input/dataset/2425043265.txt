After 4 hours and hundreds of dollars spent on an unnecessary CT scan, we still have no cause for my symptoms. I tried getting in to my PCP, but was referred to this Urgent Care since my PCP didn't have an opening for a month! I came here because I truly needed medical care and I got scammed. I heard through the thin wall that the NP on duty was counting down until his shift was over. The consequence of this is that I was not listened to at all and I received improper care. The staff scared me into thinking I had a medical emergency just so that I would open my wallet to pay for an unnecessary procedure or go away to the ER. This way, the NP could mentally check out while still covering his own ass.4 hours later, I feel scammed and I still have to spend more time and money tomorrow finding out what the real issue is. They didn't listen to me or my primary care physician and led me down an expensive and stressful path. It's so sad what healthcare has turned into!I feel like this place is open 24 hours, close to the strip, just to scam tourists maybe? I don't know. Not a good experience :(
