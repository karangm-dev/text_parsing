Be very careful when having your prescriptions filled at this location and ALWAYS double-check your prescriptions. I found the wrong medication mixed in with my pills. And the explanation...."we don't know how that happened"..."mistakes happen". I will never get a prescription filled at Shoppers Drug Mart again.
