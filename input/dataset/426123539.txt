We went as a group of 15 people. Most of the items we ordered were frozen and/or from Costco! My son's pizza was burnt hard. One of the servers were giving our kids the evil eye because they were being kids and talking loudly. Right before we left, she made sure all the kids did not leave with their dollar store fake candles.
