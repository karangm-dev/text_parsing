Wow, I don't believe the bad reviews because this place was wonderful!!! Steve is the best! They fixed my Volkswagen's oil leak and were honest unlike most other shops that just wanted to up-sell me! I will definitely be back in the future and I recommend this place to anyone who has been misled and ripped off by other shops. Steve explained everything to me and I picked a day to bring my car in and the leak is all fixed! If you're looking for honesty, good customer service and reliability, definitely go here and ask for the owner, Steve!!!!
