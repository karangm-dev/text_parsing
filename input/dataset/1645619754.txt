This is one of our favorite spots to stop at while in Vegas. Services is always great, drinks are strong :), and the food is always on point. I don't give a lot of 5 star reviews but this place deserves one. We were lucky in that there was a small 4 seat table in the lounge area available for us to use since we didn't make reservations. Tip - Make sure to get on open table and make a reservation if you plan to eat at a specific time. The dinning room section isn't huge and can fill up fast. When we walked in at 8:30 on a Friday night, it was a 1.5 hour wait. We ordered the Shrimp and grits, Chicken, Waffles and Watermelon, side of Mac n' Cheese, order of deviled eggs, and order of biscuits. let's just say we over did it....considering this was food for four people. Blackberry Lemonade cocktail is a winner and they have a nice selection of local and non local craft beers.
