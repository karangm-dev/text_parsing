Dr Scarff is an amazing Doctor. I've been seeing him since I moved from California to Nevada. He is very down to earth and makes me feel comfortable. He's very easy to communicate with and addresses all your questions. I had to have a scheduled c section due to my daughter being in the breach position. This was a very emotional time for me but he made me feel comfortable with ensuring me that having a c section would probably be the most safest delivery method for my daughter. The day my daughter was born; from open to close the operation was less than 30 minutes and it went so smoothly.  We also found out that my daughter had the umbilical cord wrapped around her next pretty tightly and with having the c section instead of trying to have her flip over while in womb it prevented anything dangerous from arising. I will definitely be seeing him with my next child.100/100 best OBGYN hands down.
