This Marriott should not even have the Marriott name. It's badly in need of updating and repairs. There was rust around the door in the bathroom and the bathroom faucet was corroded. The cafe closes after breakfast so you have to eat in the lobby bar after that. They are very short on housekeeping staff. We had to call everyday at 5:00PM and ask that the room be cleaned. Eventually we just began taking towels from the pool area up to the room to take showers. The concierge lounge is open Monday through Friday morning and the staff there is very helpful but the room is small and very warm. Be aware that starting Friday afternoon, the place is overrun with kids' baseball teams. There are hundreds of kids running through the halls and taking over the pool. While the parents were in the lobby bar one night, a group of kids got on a room phone and started making prank phone calls throughout the hotel. We come to Arizona frequently but will NEVER stay here again.
