4 months ago they put air conditioning in my 88 Volvo cost me $1,000 $600 of it was for labor I taking it back because it's not blowing cold they had it for 4 days said they fixed it they did nothing. Because I called and voiced a complaint Jeff said oh you're going to complain and now you want me to help you yes it's a lifetime warranty on this air conditioning system! Told me maybe he can get me in next week these guys are a rip-off don't go to them there are definitely better places to go. I wish I would have read the reviews before I took my car to them now I'm out $1,000 and still have to get my air conditioning fixed
