Mimi's not sure if you have been listening...  On another trip to Mimi's (had a coupon) decided to try it again...  New Years Day...it was busy- we decided to sit outside- no wait.  We were waited by the manager Aaron as they were so busy and unfortunately some of their staff called in sick...  anyway...  he was extremely attentive and more importantly the food was prepared exactly correctly.Good job Mimi's! and Aaron!!!
