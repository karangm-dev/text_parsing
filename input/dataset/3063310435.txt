Was hoping for more -- pretty much sums it up. Used the online booking thing and was called back (they left a message) to let me know that time wasn't available, but had some others. Called back within 5 minutes and was told could only sit at the bar and only if we came right away. This would have been fine, except for the fact that NO ONE was there when we got there and the restaurant didn't fill up for at least an hour after. Bartenders weren't particularly friendly, food was par and overpriced. One of those places where the description makes it sound super fancy and then when it comes out it's tuna salad with saltines in the plastic. Disappointing for my first time out without kids in a year. Won't return.
