I should have listened at the other reviews for this place. I got the Hopeful Signature Poke Bowl and it was very bland, and didn't quite sit right in my stomach. Maybe too much sauce? It is comparable to  having salmon sushi ingredients in a bowl with way too much rice. It's too bad, because I love poke bowls and had high hopes for this place. 2 stars for the nice interior.
