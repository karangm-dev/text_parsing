If you're looking to meet everyone that went to Baldwin-Wallace College in the past 5 years, along with some creepy middle aged guys who enjoy staring at the younger girls, this is a good place to go.  However, the place is way too crowded on the weekends to enjoy, and I was actually yelled at by a bar tender who felt he deserved a bigger tip from my friends when they bought shots (he was probably right, but who YELLS at customers for that? Literally screaming at us that he wouldn't serve us again.)  Anyway, if you're over the college-bar feel, go somewhere else.  Lakewood has way too many nicer bars to waste your time in this one.
