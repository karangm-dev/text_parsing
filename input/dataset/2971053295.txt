Went to uptown Grill for the first time today. The place was very clean and neat. Had a cheeseburger with french fries and an ice tea. My brother-in-law had a fried bologna sandwich and said it was one of the best he has had. Food was fantastic and I'm really looking forward to going back and trying their Reuben sandwich.
