I used to always come here .. but today i just got my nails done here with my friend.. and let me just say, the people that work here are bunch of shit talking asian bitches.Paul, the a-hole that did my friend's nail tried charging her $40 for regular acrylic. I asked why & he said because she wanted it shaped & because he's using a "special nail polish" I told him thats not what we asked for & he said very rudely, "Too late. I already shaped her nails" But when i looked at it, her nails were not coffin like he said it was. It was effing square! He also told us that if we keep complaining he wont do her nails.We left with her nails looking like it was done by a 3 year old, nail polish on her skin, acrylics glued on crooked and had bubbles all over. Just horrible! we went home & i had to re-do her nails.dont come to this place.Mine was also done poorly. the acrylic was not evenly and neither was the polish.  Thought fills were $15, since when did it become $20? Such BS.
