We had a very good experience after taking the shuttle to get to the rental place.  It was a little confusing to find, but we just asked people.  We took a red eye from Dallas, maybe that is why we did not have to wait at all.  We were even offered an upgrade to a Ford Mustang, but we settled for a Jeep SUV instead due to us visiting the Grand Canyon/Zion/Arches National Parks and our backseat riders would be getting in and out of a 2 door car quite a bit.  Good experience overall.
