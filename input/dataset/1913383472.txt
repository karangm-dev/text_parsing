Came here with my partner in crime for a quick lunch before we hit the blvd. We've visited the one in Harrah's AC so we were expecting the same long sprawl of fresh, foods on themed stations just like the one we'd been to...Lets say we were highly disappointed. Its small, most foods are low quality, ill prepared (overcooked) and bland or really salty (the small salty pathetic crawfish). Luckily for us we had a Groupon, and it included alcoholic beverages, I would've been really pissed if we were charged the full price. Endless mimosas, champagne and wine helped me make it through without wining and pouting horribly.  I wanna give 1 1/2 stars but that's not possible so its a 2. The service was great, too bad the food wasn't.
