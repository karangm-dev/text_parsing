Poor communication from the management. They are quick to remind you of your rent due but when it comes to notifying you of the construction schedule, they do not notify you ahead of time. For the last 2 weeks, there has been jackhammering and pounding noises above me. I work from home and was conducting a teleconference meeting one day when suddenly, loud drilling, pounding, jackhammering noises started to go off above me. Not to mention, my dog started to shiver of fear from all of the construction noises. I have been sending emails to the management office requesting to notify me ahead of time so that I can make arrangements to take myself, my laptop, and my dog to a more quiet area. Nancy, the manager, stated on her first reply of 5 emails I have sent thus far within the last 2 weeks, stated that the construction will only last for a day. Lies! It has been ongoing off and on for 2 weeks now. Also, the pool is still under construction. I moved here in June. No pool!  It is now almost Winter time!  I've only been here for 4 months and I can't wait to move out.  They make you read hundreds of pages of HOA rules, but it's ok for them to violate the noise agreement towards you as a tenant. Had I known I'll get this type of treatment from the management, I would have just moved to a cheap apartment.
