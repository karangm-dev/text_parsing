We've done both take out and delivery from here.  Both have been good experiences. I think the piece that makes this place really stand out is the appetizers. Their dumplings are so good. They seem to be homemade and not the bulk frozen kind. I enjoy the crab rangoon also. Spring rolls and egg rolls are also very good. I am still working on finding a favorite main dish but the dumplings keep me coming back for more!
