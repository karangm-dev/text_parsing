My mother is 89 years old and lives alone.  She suffers from Dementia and has not been able to get around very well.. I wanted to have a caregiver to be there for her to make sure she has help with her meals, medication reminders and transportation to appointments.  I was really nervous about having someone who I did not know being with my mother but Cerna has helped ease the stress and has provided such wonderful service for my mother.  The caregivers are so compassionate and has given me much peace of mind!
