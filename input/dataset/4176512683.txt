A young couple owns this place.  They're nice enough but this 50ish woman found them a bit condescending.  The gal cut my hair, but didn't do what I'd asked for to make my style less heavy on top/front.  She called her husband over for assistance. He ended up doing what I asked, but the questions he posed as he was cutting were a bit insulting.  I'm sure he didn't mean it that way, but I didn't appreciate being asked if I fixed my hair on a daily basis.  I asked for a short easy style that could be jazzed up on occasion. I left feeling a bit insulted.  Won't go back, but wish them luck!
