I had the worse experience ever. We were so excited to see the puppies and kittens. I saw a munchkin kitten that I just HAD to have. I asked if I could see the munchkin, and I of course fell in love. When we were done they took the kitten away and I decided to ask questions about the kitten the worker answered one then walked away and acted as if I wasn't going to purchase the kitten, since she acted so rude I would never purchase an animal there EVER. The workers there ignored you and went to drink their Starbucks instead and joke around. The dogs smelled of pee and poop, because the kennels were disgusting, half the animals there looked sickly especially the guineas. I will never return and make sure no one else I know never goes there too. This place is terrible, terrible work ethic and terrible manners.
