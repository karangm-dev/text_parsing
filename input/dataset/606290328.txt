Tom Thumb's Campfire Bistro tacos were the best thing at Yelp's Western Adventure!  Other than the Tequila Bus :-)  I've been to Tom Thumb and eaten at Campfire many times.  Their Yelp event was great fun too.  This morning we took the kids for gingerbread house building event they had.  Terrific as always.
