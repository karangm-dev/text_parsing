The salon is very clean and they do a good job BUT they nickel and dime you for EVERYTHING. Their basic pedi doesn't even include a massage. Extra $5 for that. And to remove your gel polish is an extra $5. I basically went in for a pedi and gel mani and paid $95!! Mind you, this is a basic run of the mill nail salon, nothing special. Definitely not worth the pric
