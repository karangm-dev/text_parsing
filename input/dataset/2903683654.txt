I love working out at camelback crossfit. Coach Matt provides a different workout everyday so you will never get bored. In the first month, I was so surprised at how much stronger I got. The environment is very friendly to new members, especially people new to the area. Most of my friends are people I met at crossfit. I highly recommend this gym!
