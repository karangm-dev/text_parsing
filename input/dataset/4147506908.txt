So I really love the crust...really love the cheese...but this place needs to work on their customer service.The first time we visited they wouldn't seat two of us at a four top until our other friends arrived.  We would have spent more $$ on some drinks, but even though they were not busy they wouldn't seat us.The second time we had a better experience, but after moving tables to be father from the door (and cold air coming in b/c they wanted to leave it open) our original waitress who brought our drinks was upset and said..."well now I can't help you" because we were in a new area.The third time, though, is the ultimate in tacky service.  Our night was great with awesome pizza....half of us coming from the E Valley for a get-together with out-of-town relatives.  It was great...until after we paid the bill...  As we sat there visiting and enjoying our night, drinking the wine and pop we had paid for, our waitress comes up and asks us to leave.  She said that we were sitting at the only 4 top...and that a wait list was forming.  As we walked out and I think "Is this really happening?  Did I we just give her a 24% tip just to be asked to leave?" I see another totally empty 4 top and only 2 people waiting to be seated.Wow...for a place that claims to be straight from Italy, they should know that in Italy restaurant owners let their customers eat and talk and take as much time as you like.  I'd have to say that time number 3 was it for us...we'll go to Grimaldis, Pizzaria Bianco, or Spinatos the next time we want pizza.
