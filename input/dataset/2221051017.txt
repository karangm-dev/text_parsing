I'll go ahead and bump this up to a 5. If it's the best food court Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food I've probably had - why not? Frankly, it's better than 90% of other comparable places at this price range too.Apart from what I mentioned in my earlier review, their meat quality is fantastic; I've had both the chicken and beef which are shaved fresh off the spit to order. I've heard others say the fish is very good too.They offer a large selection of sides. Even if some are probably not that traditional - such as a mixed bean salad, they're still high quality and work perfectly fine with the meal IMO.Very busy place, and clearly many others recognise their quality, though they keep the line moving well. Quite possibly the best thing at Eglinton Square mall.
