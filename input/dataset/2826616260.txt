This used to be my family's favorite Chinese place. The old owners gave excellent, tasty portions for the price, with plenty of extra vegetables. The fried rice was flavorful, the egg rolls were a nice size and exploding with flavor, too. We found out that House of Pearl got new owners and decide to try it out to see how much it changed. Well, overall, we are disappointed with the food. For me, this place goes from five stars to two. The General Tso sauce is different; it is far too sweet and not as deep and rich, with a balance of sweet and savory, as the old sauce. If you want a similar taste from the former owners, Asia Garden's General Tso in Strongsville is almost identical, though, more expensive. We asked for it extra, extra spicy and it was not at all. The new owners changed to smaller, plastic containers - smaller portions. We got maybe four pieces of broccoli, five slivers of carrot, and two pieces of green pepper with our dinner size entree. The fried rice was just barely, hardly any flavor or pork in it; no peas, carrots, or onions. We're glad we just got a small side of it and not a big one, which would have been a waste. The egg rolls tasted almost the same; the old ones were bigger and had more punch of flavor. Our fortune cookies were soft and stale.We will not be back unless the old owners return. Sad that we have to find a new favorite Chinese food place.
