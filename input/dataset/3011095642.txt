This is definitely a restaurant that counts on the neighborhood foot traffic to keep it in business.  The food was decent...a bit better than bar food.  The zucchini chips are still just fried food...there isn't any seasoning on them to make them special.  The pork taco appetizers were good, but drippy and the chicken sandwich was tasty.  We almost walked out after waiting 30 minutes for the zucchini chips while the table next to us received 3 courses each!  Also when the waiter (finally) noticed our drinks were empty and he'd bring us refills we watched him flit around for another 10 minutes or so before he came back to the table & then remembered he'd forgotten our refills.  Also parking is a bit of a bear with Reid's foods.  The patio is relatively quiet & very casual with several patrons propping their feet up on chairs.  If the service had been good we might have returned, but since it's not worth the wait I doubt we will go again.
