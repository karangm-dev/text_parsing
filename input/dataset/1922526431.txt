Grab a bucket and get your quarters ready because this is a great place to go to kill an hour during the day. Just a few miles east of the strip you can probably spend the least amount of money while in Vegas. I probably spent close to an hour reminiscing about some of the machines and playing about $5 worth of games. The old machines are $.25 the ones from the 90s are $.50, and the newer ones are $.75. Even the girls had fun playing.Make sure to bring some hand sanitizer because you don't know who's grubby little hands have been on those machines.
