Ordered some online and  was very easy, it came within a week. Delicious as usual (Jerk, Thai, Pepper, Teriyaki and Wasabi our fav). Leaving on vacation to Puerto Rico on Tuesday and ordered a ton more to snack on it on the beach. Called in to see if it would arrive by then and the owner actually answered and was very friendly. He definitely appreciates his clients. Oh and coupons and nutritional information are on the horizon!
