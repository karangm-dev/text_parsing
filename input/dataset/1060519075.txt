Dave's Dog House is top notch and absolutely delicious! Been going there since I was a kid and they have only gotten better and better. Doggie style fries are TO DIE FOR! Hot dogs have that amazing snap when you bite into them and I could eat just their Texas bread buns  by themselves. Definitely a place to make a regular. And they are opening one at the Staples Center in LA Cali!!!
