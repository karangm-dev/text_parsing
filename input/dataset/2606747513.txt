I LOVE this place! I have found the staff to be extremely knowledgable, beyond helpful and always willing to go above and beyond to do whatever they can to assist you. This store carries products that I can't find anywhere else besides online. They are great about returns if you have a finicky eater (like mine). I also love that they have no agenda when it comes to helping you select a certain food. They listen to what you're looking for and then make suggestions based on the info you've given them. They're also well versed in the latest pet food recalls (which are hard to stay on top of these days!)If you sign up online, they offer discounts and specials all the time which helps with some of the pricier food. Organized, clean, and a huge selection. I have absolutely no complaints about this place... Except maybe that when they hold weekend pet adoptions I get depressed that I can't take all the animals home.
