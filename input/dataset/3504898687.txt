I received a gift card about a year ago that was purchased for $65, I waited a while to use it because the first time i went to this salon they said they didn't have a women to do acrylics which is what i wanted. So months later I find time to go back and the man at the front desk tells me my gift card is expired... although that was $65 that someone already bought for me therefore he just basically stole that money. He lets me use it anyway. The women who did my nails was awesome and did a great job! I then went back up to the front desk and she was going cash me out but the man said i already paid. Okay! SOOO i look online and what i had gotten done was $45 and he took the entire $65, I then tipped the nice women who did my nails. In conclusion this Frank man is a rip off and i feel bad for the workers because they will continue to loose service. I will not be returning even if i gt another gift card this year. The End.
