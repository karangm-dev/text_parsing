Excellent food with exemplary service.  Jennine provides expert guidance, professional service, and has more training and knowledge that this particular menu and venue can contain. Great pizza, pasta, wine, and dessert! Don't miss the calamari.  Magnifique! We will always return to this location, and expect greatness. An added plus-- dinner and a show! Tables overlook the Golden Nugget pool, a vibrant show of a large variety of curiosity and humanity.  Enjoy!
