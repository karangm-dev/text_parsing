I went when it first opened and sat outside.  Food was good - especially loved the gnocchi with the preserved lemons.  Three of us went tonight and it was miserable.  First, the noise was unbearable! We saw people walk out before ordering because of this.  Chris Bianco should be careful he doesn't have workman's comp claims for hearing loss.  I am serious about this. The arugula, peach & pecan salad had 3 small peach slices and NO pecans and very small amount of goat cheese,  The gnocchi was horrible.  A few of them were cold like they had been in the refrigerator and heated up. There was a glob of curdled goat cheese in one corner of the dish and no real sauce.  There were NO preserved lemons.  Another person in our party also had the same experience with her gnocchi.  Will never go back.  The quality of Chris Bianco's restaurants has gone way down.  Maybe he needs to oversee his kitchens and chefs a little more.  I am sorry for him because he has always worked so hard in this community.  I will say the service was good.
