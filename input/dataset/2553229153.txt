The only reason I'm giving a two (which is generous) is because the pizza was delicious and they have Hop Knot. The service was fine, nothing fantastic but not horrible. My boyfriend and I went for the date night dinner because it seemed like a good deal. The caprese was okay, not traditional style but it was still tasty. I ordered the Strawberry salad and he had the chopped, both of which were horrible...and we are the two least picky eaters you will ever meet. I could barely even pick at the salad which was really disappointing. As I stated previously, the pizza was delicious. The issue I had was the other individuals at the bar. The restaurant was basically empty. There were two extremely drunk woman at the bar creating a huge show. At one point one woman lifted up her shirt and showed her bra to the bartender. Although it made for good conversation, it was embarrassing, hard to watch, and the last thing I want to see when I want to have a nice relaxing dinner out. No one asked them to leave or seemed to stop serving or even offered to call them a cab. Because there were so few individuals even eating in the restaurant I was surprised they didn't discount everyone's bill for having to see that. I could only imagine what would have happened if there were families present (this was around about 8 at night)Great pizza, okay beer selection, but that's about all. I was really disappointed in my time there and I don't think I'll be returning.
