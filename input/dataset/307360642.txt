I booked an appt for 3 people (two adults one child). They only have 2 pedicure chairs. So, we all had to go at different times because one was already pre occupied. I bought a groupon for a 1 hour hydrotherapy pedicure & massage. My whole pedicure took 20mins or less. She only did one coat of paint and the paint job was mediocre. No massage. My friend's pedicure on the other hand took over an hour and they didn't use any product. Paint job was bad and the water was cold. Neither one of us left feeling it was money well spent. The ladies were pleasant.
