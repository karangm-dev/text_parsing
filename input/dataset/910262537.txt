Roadrunner Pharmacy has given me consistently first-rate service for two years now.  They provide metamazole in the form of a topical gel for my cat's thyroid condition.  Having that medication in a gel, which I apply to my critter's ears, is worth the extra price compared to the grief of trying to get pills down his throat without getting myself torn up.  Their prices are reasonable, service via UPS delivery is lightning fast.On my most recent refill order I had to phone in because my credit card number had changed.  This is the ONLY criticism I have of Roadrunner and it's a very minor one - You can't enter a new credit card through their Web site.On the other hand, the phone call was worth it because the person who helped me pointed out that I could save a bunch of money by having a larger quantity shipped (last two refills at the same time.)  She assured me that the shelf life of the product was long enough that it wouldn't be a problem having a two-month supply on hand.Thank you, Roadrunner!
