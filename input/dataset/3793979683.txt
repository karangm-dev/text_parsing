After hearing from friends about how good this place is, we finally decided to give it a try and we are glad we did. It was very busy when we arrived. We had to wait for 15 minutes but this was pretty good considering that it was a weekend. The service was prompt and they knew theirs menus.It took a little while for the food to arrive but I think the preparation for what we ordered could take awhile. The portions were huge.  I had the Buffalo wrap with a Tuscan white bean soup. My friend had a falafel taco with fries. It was surprisingly filling that I had to take 1/2 of my  wrap home. I can't speak for my friend but my Buffalo wrap had a bit of kicks but not too spicy. It was temph with a lot of julienned vegetables, a bit messy to eat but luckily they gave us a lot of napkins. The soup kinda reminds me of lentil soup.The best part is you feel full but not heavy nor bloated. Definitely worth going back over and over again
