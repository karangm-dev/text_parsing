Six weeks before our wedding, I rounded up my friends and family for a cake-tasting expedition.  I had tried cakes from 6 bakeries before our get together and narrowed it down to 2 bakeries.  Las Vegas Custom Cakes trumped the competition hands down!  The flavor and texture of their cakes is nothing short of exquisite. Cristina is a professional - she knows how to custom design a wedding cake that more than met our expectations.  I had a picture of a topper that Yamilet re-created in our wedding colors - it was so adorable that I still have it on my kitchen counter weeks after the wedding.I've heard nothing but raves from all of our guests about the 2 different flavors - we chose a chocolate cake with cappuccino filling for the top and bottom layer; and a white cake with their house special fruit for the middle layer.  Two of our friends immediately asked for Las Vegas Custom Cakes contact info for their upcoming special occasions.
