I was very pleased with my visit yesterday the staff was friendly and got my drink out fast I wasn't sure what I wanted but I was helped by a young lady named Bella and she really took the time to listen and know what I wanted. She even continued to talk with me after I bought my coffee the employees really did make my day. I will continue to come back to this location.
