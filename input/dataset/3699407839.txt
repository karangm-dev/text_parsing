The finest buffet I've ever been to in my entire life. They had all types of seafood from fish, to crab legs, to lobster and and shrimp cocktail. They had all kinds of meats from beef, to lamb to . . . venison? Wow! All delicious, all varieties and all amazing! For a $25 dinner price it was a steal! I dream of "The Buffet at Bellagio" to this day.
