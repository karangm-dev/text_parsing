We went for brunch and the place was quiet when we first arrived but filled up around noon. Everyone loved the fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was tender and juicy - we had high expectations and were not disappointed - and the service was very friendly. There was a great selection of seventies and eighties music playing, a welcome change to the usual elevator music they play in some other restaurants. Will definitely come back!
