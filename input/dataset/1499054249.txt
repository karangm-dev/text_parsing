Honestly, this is one of my favorite hotels/dinner dates to go with my boyfriend. We devour the oysters here and always have such great service. The last time we visited our waiter gave us such great recommendations and really explained the wine that we got (free with a check-in). It's fantastic! The grilled octopus and the carpaccio is amazing! Not to mention their cute breads. We will always eat here when staying at GVR. Can't keep us away! And the decor is just splendid!
