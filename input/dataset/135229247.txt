This church is like a big beautiful oak tree!  It has so many branches that are linked together as one (men's, women's, cleansing stream, worship, preforming arts, youth, celebrate recovery, small groups, marriage, media ministries). Their CELEBRATE RECOVERY ministry is amazing!  Every Friday night, rain, snow, holiday, it doesn't matter, they are there.  A very dependable and safe support group!  This church really understands that we have another generation who are watching and learning from us.  It is important to Grace Walk to teach our children (on their level), how to relate to Christ, show them how much He loves them, so they can  be our future generation of winning souls to Christ.The senior Pastor has a beard and rides a Harley because he knows how to relate to our youth and yes, I do believe God has told him He wants him to do exactly that.  This church is what I call, "down to earth, and as real as it gets".  The sermons are ones we can all relate to in our everyday life.  We get taught how God wants us to talk, think, live and treat others, based on principles and scripture from the Bible.
