We've passed here for several years and have always wanted to check it out.  They grill they chicken outdoors and you can smell the delicious smoke from blocks away. We finally tried it today and we were very disappointed.  We ordered the family meal.  Full chicken, rack of ribs, and three sides.   The chicken was dry.  The ribs were okay...tasted like they were boiled.   And the sides were mediocre.  The family meal was $50. They have one flavor of BBQ sauce.  It tasted like regular KC Masterpiece.  They had one hit sauce, which tasted like Frank's Red Hot.  Service was good.  Location was convenient.  Food was mediocre.  We won't be back.
