I have lived in numerous apartment complexes, and this is at least in the top 2, if not my favorite.  I lived here for 3 years.It was quiet, peaceful (I lived on a ranch-style one bedroom) and in a beautiful setting.  I especially loved being able to walk with my dog to Lake Erie -- beautiful park about 1 mile away.The city of Willoughby was a pleasure to live in.  I loved my little garden out front.  There is ample space to walk or jog around the area.  I trained for a half marathon living here!I had no issues moving in or out.  No hidden charges upon move out.  Loved having an in-unit washer and dryer (I paid a company to install them and I paid a small fee monthly to use them).No apartment complex is perfect (an open concept kitchen would've been awesome!), but this one was one of my all-time favorites. :)
