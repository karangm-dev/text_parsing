90 minutes for two cold pizzas.....sorry at this point even a two star review is generous.While in town with friends, we wanted an easy meal after running the half marathon earlier in the day.  Consulting Yelp, I saw that this place had good reviews, they delivered and since we were less than a mile from them, we figured we'd have the food fairly fast (there were two hungry toddlers and five hungry adults, and we needed food, stat!)Upon calling, we first asked if they delivered to hotels just to be sure.  If they didn't, that would be fine we'd call someplace else.  So we ordered our two pizzas and gave them the name and address of the hotel. It is a newish hotel, so I told my buddy to tell them "It's right by the Consol Energy Center, where the Penguins play".  I figured that even if they didn't know the hotel or the address, most people in Pittsburgh would know where the Penguins play.  We were concerned when we had to say the name of the hotel four times and as it turned out, we were right to be concerned.After an hour with no pizzas, we call and they guy says "Oh, the delivery guy is on your street right now.  Should be 2 minutes".  20 minutes later the delivery guy calls and says he's on his way.  We ask if he knows where he's going and he says yes.  10 minutes later he calls again and asks where we are.  When we finally got the pizza, it was not hot.  The cheese had congealed everywhere and it looked like it had been cut by a toddler.  There were so big slices, some little slices...just not the usual uniform slices.I felt bad for the guy because he said his GPS had been stolen that morning, but we tried everything to make sure that the place new we were at the hotel right beside the arena and it still failed.  Better luck next time.
