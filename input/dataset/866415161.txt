My wife and I ate here last time we were in town, the food was great, the beer was great. Mark was our server and he rocked. We started with nachos, they were well cooked and full of toppings. Followed it up with the lamb stew which was excellent!My wife had the club sandwich, it was huge. Great bread, awesome topping and the fries it came with were amazing.Go here!
