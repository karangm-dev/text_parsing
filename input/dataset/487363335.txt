Tried the Salt Cellar for a special occasion.  We started with salads that had bottled dressing and vegetables that came out of a bag.  I ordered a steamed lobster and it clearly hadn't seen the ocean in a very long time.  It was obviously pre-cooked and re-heated.  My husband ordered the crab cakes and they were way more cake than crab.  Baked potatoes were lukewarm and the poor broccoli was smothered in some unidentified sauce.  The service was good but that's the only thing that was.
