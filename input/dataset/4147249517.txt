DAPHNIE IS AMAZING! I've been seeing her for almost 2 years because of a Groupon! My skin  has dramatically improved because she really knows her stuff and has a true passion! The head Dr is so kind and always remembers me. He does great Botox as well! (He teaches it so he knows his stuff!) EVERY single staff member is ALWAYS smiling and SO sweet! I can't say enough great things about this place! Things I've done there: Dermaroller, IPL Photofacial, Blue light with acid peel, Vanquish, Botox and medical marijuana card renewal.
