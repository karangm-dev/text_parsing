Went with family and was disappointed in the food.  Server was very nice but the quality of food was very poor. We ordered chicken lettuce wraps and it tasted like the chicken wasn't cooked all the way and was quite cold. Chicken tacos with a slimy feel to chicken and it had to be frozen before being cooked.  Had to wait for a while on kids order which was wrong. Server did discount the meal but won't go back because food quality was poor and made me sick later. Hate to ever write a bad review but this was not a great experience.
