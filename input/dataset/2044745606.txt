I had my 60,000 mile check up and my oil change.  They pointed out a couple of other immediate needs but what I really appreciated were their explanations.  It made it easy to make a decision about the next steps needed to care for my car. They educate you about your vehicle and the process of maintenance. They give you choices and are creative with their solutions if one has budgetary limitations. From what I researched on line, their prices seem comparable to the going rate.Vehicle: Toyota Camry Service Date: 10/23/2017Review Created: 10/24/2017 02:58 PM
