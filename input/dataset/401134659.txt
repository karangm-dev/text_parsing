I visited the store today and was totally amazed! I went looking for an end table but came out with 3 tables, a lamp, a beautiful Victorian sculpture and all were great deals! Everything was unique and different and each piece has a story. I will have to make room in my house and go back soon.   The staff gave me some great ideas!
