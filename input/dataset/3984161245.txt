This is my one must go to spot when I visit Vegas. It has always been excellent food with large portions at a good price for years.  I have had breakfast lunch and dinner here and it never disappoints.  Funky chrome and purple neon decor adds to its charms.  Friendly staff. It's a popular place so be prepared to wait during peak meal hours and weekends.
