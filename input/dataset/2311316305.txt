I found this place because of Yelp, and it was near my new place. Parking was easy to find, and it's located in what looks to be an old motel that's been recently renovated. It's super cute! The food was delicious with a beautiful presentation and they had a nice happy hour. Our waiter was very sweet, and made great recommendations. I will absolutely be returning!
