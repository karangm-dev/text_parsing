Ordered the Mac and cheese Burger, and brisket nachos. Also ordered two glasses of water, which had no ice and were lukewarm.Not sure if we we're supposed to have a mind blowing dinner or not sitting on the patio with a drink with no ice, and super bland Mac and cheese. If that's your specialty, you really fell through. The nachos we're good though.No bathroom in the restaraunt? Date night fail.
