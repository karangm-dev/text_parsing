I went to Dr. Rick office for general dentistry is great.  He is good and gentle.  However I had an implant put in by him about 2 years ago and have had many proplems with it.  I have to get my teeth cleaned every 3 months because of the deep pockets around the implant.  Now I had to go for oral surgery to close the pockets.  I asked Dr. Rick if he would pay for some of the cost since he gave me a 5 year guarantee.  I was told no the gaurantee was cancelled when I left the practice.  One implant has cost me $7,421.00 which is horriable.  I do not recomend him.
