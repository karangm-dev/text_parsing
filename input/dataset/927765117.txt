Tried about 4-5 different technicians all of them pretty much useless... No scrub during pedicure, massage is not even a massage but a quick rub off. And do not be shocked when you get a 30$ bill for a manicure?! So if you're going once a week it adds up to be too much. Half the nail colors are old and dry. I am only giving 1 star for an ambiance and TVs. But I am ready to find another nail place.
