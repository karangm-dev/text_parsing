I've been working with Stonegate for several years now. They've been patient with my family and I as we transitioned to life in Vegas. San and Coby has helped us find rental locations until we were ready to finally buy a permanent home. We finally decided on a beautiful condo in the Silverado Ranch neighborhood last week. We just closed! If you want fast, honest, diligent and quality service please contact them for your real estate needs. I'll be recommending Stonegate to all my friends and family.
