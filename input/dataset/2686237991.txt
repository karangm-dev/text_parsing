Unfortunately for me, I did not read the reviews before I came here.  I was there for 20 min and checked out.  It was filthy.  The floor was not vacuumed and the walls were dirty in every room.  I was afraid to walk without my shoes anywhere in that room.  I called to complain to their National complaint line, they put me on hold for 20 minutes then hung up on me.  I should have known when the parking lot was empty of cars, and the only people hanging around were some homeless people.  I left and paid 30 dollars more a night for a beautiful and CLEAN ROOM elsewhere.  How is this place still open?????
