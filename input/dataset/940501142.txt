Came here for lunch with time to kill before heading to the airport. An incredibly beautiful October afternoon with temps going up, sitting outside in the shade was delightful, including the many birds and people-watching from this excellent location.I was seated promptly, it was $6 burger day, so why not? My sweet and seemingly feisty waitress helped me figure out which one (the Cowboy Burger, and it was great), with a $3 on tap Blue Moon beer. Served on a camping type plate, this was just casual enough, and inexpensive enough but delicious enough to last a long time. This is perfect for watching sports and hanging around downtown. Think World Series!I read previous reviews about the staff. I experienced some confusion when delivering my beer, but when I asked the hostess, I found her delightful and helpful. The confused busser was equally kind. My waitress? Great personality and attentive service! It's a casual place and I'd recommend it with enthusiasm.
