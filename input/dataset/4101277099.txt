Water heater started leaking today and it was time for a replacement.I was contacted within minutes of requesting a quote and given a time frame for later in the afternoon.Friendly tech came by, assessed and provided a firm quote based for replacing the tank and adding in some improvements for future safety.  Removed the old, replaced with new and was done in about an hour.Problem solved and solved promptly with a smile.
