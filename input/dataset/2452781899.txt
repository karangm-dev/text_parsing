So happy we opted for this hotel in Pitts. As newcomers to visit DT Pitts for a wknd we found ourselves with minimal options to book affordably downtown in our very last minute search to book. So, we booked in DblTree Green- best choice!The front desk welcome experience was great! The room was comfy & clean. I did not experience the "endless walk/dungeon feel" other reviewers have posted. Yes, it is a large hotel but , seriously, NOT that big.... Anyhow, we didn't feel the walk to our room was any different than that in any other of the hundreds of hotels we've stayed at.The lobby is quite nice and they have good options for lobby dining/bar and full starbucks on-site which is rare and awesome!Parking was plenty.Best of All - it is considerably cheaper to stay here vs a downtown hotel and the uber ride(s) costs ($7-11 avg) during a weekend trip totally adds up to still be way less than what one would spend staying DT. (fyi- when we were researching, the avg. DT hotel was $250p/n +parking at $30-40p/n + no breakfast included). Just to give you a baseline for any cost comparisons...)If I were to visit Pitts again, I would just go straight to booking here again.
