The service and guacamole were great. The rest of the food......shrimp tacos were cold and the slaw was cucumber and not cabbage which was very strange and not great. Cold bland corn tortillas. Carne tacos were tough and awful. Fries were decent. Rice and beans soupy and cold. Expensive for what you get, even for Vegas.
