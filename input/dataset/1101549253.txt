You can always sell something once.  Walked in to Pixy Cakes one weekday around noon for cupcakes. I  had never been there before.  What appeared to be a lone clerk never asked if I was looking for anything in particular, if I had ever been there, if I understood pricing, if she cold answer any questions; I got nothing.  I got a bored stare until I figured out I'd try a 1/2 dozen and named off my flavors and she quickly filled the order.  As far as I can figure, I felt like I was a burden to eat up maybe 5 minutes of this person's time making a sale to me.  I will NEVER return nor recommend this place.  Sad to say because the cupcakes were delicious.
