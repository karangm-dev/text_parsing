If I lived here in Vegas I'd be here all the time! I found this gem on Yelp on our way back from a boat ride on Lake Mead with my family who came from all over for a mini family reunion. We had a party of 7 and they greeted us with warm smiles and hospitality.  I love that it's a Mom and Pop diner style place with their awesome daughter Jessie as a amazing server. She really went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed.The atmosphere is warm and welcome and had a family vibe with cute kitschy photos and decor. I just loved it!!! To start we had delicious Fried Pickles, Mushrooms and Zucchini. The food was perfectly cooked and still had a nice crunch. We all had delicious burgers and a Reuben. The food was SOOOO DELICIOUS!!! I love a great burger and the mushroom Swiss burger I had was phenomenal!!! I'll be sending all my friends in Vegas and those visiting to come visit this wonderful family! Thank you Little City Grille family for treating us like family!  We will be back next time we are in town.
