Possibly the worst sound system I've ever experienced. Inside it feels like a laptop speakers blaring and outside it sounds like a giant sub where they forgot the speakers (although outside is way more tolerable than inside). This is pretty evident from the lack of people dancing except for the occasional drunk girl duo with douchey guy watching.
