This place is awesome!!  DDD sealed the deal with his show so we had to check it out.   You walk in and it's like a little European market with wines, bread, cheese, desserts etc.  Of course we got the full order cheese steak and God bless it was yummy.   Now it's not a philly cheese steak in the sense of finely shredded beef, but you can taste it's the real deal.   We also got a half order of lasagna and it was delicious as well!   And a side of artichoke salad which was yummy as well.  Getting a cannoli to go and some imported wine.  We'd get more but no cooler with an 8hr drive home.  This place a definite must if your visiting and if your local and haven't been here yet your missing out!!
