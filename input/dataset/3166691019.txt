Fav: pistachio milk tea w honey boba, light ice, 75% sweet+ yummy and diverse drink options+ free photo booth+ a couple free arcade games and can check out some board games from the front desk+ clean, nice ambiance+ fast service+ indoor and outdoor seating- ok priced drinks. Not quite expensive but not quite cheap either! My drink was $4.89 total (In SF boba drinks can range from $0.99 to $5)Woot woot, I found boba in Arizona! Hailing from SF, where milk tea is so common, my friends and I were excited to come here to Phoenix and try the boba drinks here. I got the pistachio milk tea w honey boba, light ice and I LOVED it. For me it was a bit too sweet though, so the only thing I'd do next time is order it 75% sweet, not regular sweet. The boba texture was perfect as well: soft, chewy, with slight sweetness. Had fun playing the arcade game and photo booth, too! Would come back! Good to see there's some good boba going on in Phoenix ;D
