We bring our two dogs to Diana to be groomed quarterly and I am always pleasantly surprised that she remembers who they are when I make the appointment. The grooming is always affordable and very well done.  On top of that, they are always ready about an hour before what she originally tells us when I drop them off which is great because I usually miss them quite a bit when they are there!
