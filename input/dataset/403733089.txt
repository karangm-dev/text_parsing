The only downside to Bluebird Kitchen is that it isn't closer to my office. For this reason, I've only been able to try their breakfast foods (lunch isn't served until 11) but I've been impressed with everything I've had. Their breakfast sandwiches are hearty but not too heavy, and the pastries are light and satisfying. I love the flavor combinations: orange and pistachio, blueberry and almond, coconut and cashew, classic mixed berry... and to top it all off, the prices are comparable/lower than chains or other caf√©s like this one. Everything is made in-house, so even if you go for the day-old half-price pastries, it's still fresher than just about anything else you can find in the area. Plus the counter staff are friendly without being onobnoxious or annoying. Bluebird Kitchen is definitely the type of restaurant Pittsburgh needs more of.
