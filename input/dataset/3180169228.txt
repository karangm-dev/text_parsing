The Beatles? Count me in. Cirque du Soleil? Yea, why not. Combine the two? OHH YEAA.I've seen enough Cirque shows to know that the is no such thing as bad seats (unless it just happens to be obstructed) and I actually prefer the seats in the back since you don't have to crane your neck. We had the perfect view of everything from the back (all performers, corners, screens).The show starts out slow but things really kick into gears half way through. By the end, I'm crying from the performance and nostalgia, and then when it ends, I'm just sad there isn't more. Beautifully choreographed to the songs and just flows so perfectly.
