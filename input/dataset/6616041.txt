Worst Buying Expeience!Ordered a PS4 online with instore pickup at 10am.  They advertise that you should be able to pickup your Order in about 45 minutes.  When I never recieved anything from best buy I went down to the store around 3 and they told me it could jot be canceled or picked up yet.  Severel hours later I spent almost 3 hours on the phone with the store and then customer service.   The funds have been secured on my card but I cant pickup my order and I cant cancel it. WTF!  My frustration level is thru the roof.  No one cares and no one has the athority to do anything.  This is why Amazon is getting all of best buys buisness!
