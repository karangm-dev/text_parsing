NO DRINK MENU and really RUDE BARTENDER.Why not? I know it's quite a busy bar, but they should still have a drink menu in my opinion. We are not familiar with cocktail drinks and since we got 2 complimentary drinks for Staying at The Monte Carlo, we thought of maybe trying something different than my usual virgin pina colada and margarita.  We were not greeted at all when we sat at the bar, it wasn't too busy, but the bartender looked at us and didn't say anything. Maybe because we were holding  our "free drink coupon"? I didn't want to assume. But when we got one bartender's attention, we asked for a drink menu and said they didn't have any then walked away. When we got his attention again and asked if he recommended a drink and I swear, he said "umm..I dunno Mai Tai?" in a rude tone. What's up with the attitude? I had to raise my voice and asked the same question and his attitude changed a bit, and pushed for a Mai Tai.So yes, we got a Mai Tai and a Margarita. Both were disgusting. I don't know what a Mai Tai supposed to taste like but it was very bitter. The Margarita was bitter too and was all alcohol. So disappointed!!!!
