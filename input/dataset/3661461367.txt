I frequent this location and although I love the ice cream, I often dread the visit, knowing that it will likely be quite a long wait (it usually is). Today was no exception. There was only one guy working and he didn't seem to have any sense of urgency, despite the long line. Also, today they were out of cookies, almonds, brownies and lids. I understand that supply runs low at times, but what annoyed me more than anything is that the guy working didn't tell me that they were out of the ingredients until he already started making the items I ordered. Each item I ordered was missing at least one item . . . had I known that before he started making it, perhaps I would have ordered a different item from the menu. To be fair, he did give me a discount on the price for the inconvenience.
