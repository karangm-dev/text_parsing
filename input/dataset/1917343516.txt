Was very surprised at how much we liked this place.  Walked in during the afternoon and sat around one of the fire places.  Was greeted almost immediately by a waitress, who was dressed in a very nice black dress.  She sat next to us and took our order and answered any questions that we had.  Very attentive and very friendly.  Drinks were well made and loved the environment.  The only complaint I had, was that we were sitting too close to the bar, so you did get the smoke coming by you, if you don't like smoke like we don't, I would just recommend sitting farther away from the bar.
