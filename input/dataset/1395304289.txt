Nope.  Not again.  I am a medium height woman with fairly narrow hips.  The reason I share this, is because after a three hour flight, my bum was actually bruised.  The seats are not actually padded (if you have to fly them, bring a cushion) and they are so narrow there is no squirm room.  You get into position, buckle up, and stay exactly in place for the flight.  And bring your water along.  Theirs is $2.  I get paying extra for food and drinks, but water?
