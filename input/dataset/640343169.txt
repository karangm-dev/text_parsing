This was my first time here, and I'm sure it will be my last. It was unusually cold out for Phoenix, so I thought a hot cocoa would be perfect. I ordered a large hot cocoa, not sure what I got but it was the worst hot cocoa I've had in my life. If pressed, I would have to say it resembles malt ovaltine. ( But with no taste, really bland, Ovaltine would be exciting in comparison. )
