Second to last time I went here I ordered the uptown salad online. Picked it up, got back to work and realized they had given me a farmhouse salad- and I do NOT like hard boiled eggs. Last time I went here (11/3/15), they gave me the right salad..,and it was horrible. There was hardly any toppings on my wilted lettuce. My boyfriend got a sandwich that he didn't care for, and the chick pea salad he got for later didn't even have chick peas on it!!!!Won't be back here for a VERY long time....come on guys, get it right....
