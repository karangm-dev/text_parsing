Lets begin with I was already one shot in when we arrived so my sweet tooth kicked it. Didn't help that everything in the front looks absolutely delish! Everything is so colorful and pretty.Darn you over priced sugar factory you've suckered us in!We went with the ice cream and red velvet brownie..Lets start with the brownie is WAY to sweet, we both took one bite and then had to throw it away. The cream cheese didnt taste like cream cheese frosting. It didnt taste like a brownie either. it was as if they put velvet cake on a chocolate brownie. what a waste. sugar over load! yuck! It looked better than it tasted. The ice cream was good but i've had better.. Tiff got the cream brulee and my mouth watered for the hazelnutt chocolate. Lets say that I like the Thrifty's down the street better.. both were just okay, not worth the price.All 3 items cost 28 bucks... RIP OFF!
