I got a new BMW and was worried about the cost of service. That's not the problem - I've gotten my car serviced twice here. Getting an appointment took at least 10 phone calls and two site visits as they didn't return my calls. Called twice day before yesterday, then left a note on my service advisor's desk without a return call. They must not need the customers.See Below- thanks for the reply Molly. Tried calling twice today. Left a message once, no call back. I told the receptionist I wasn't getting return calls. I feel like a stalker. The Engine Malfunction lights been on since Sunday. Went to a non dealer shop, my first time ever doing so as there is comfort going to the dealer.
