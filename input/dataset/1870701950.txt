While out driving around you may want to remember that you are in a company truck. This morning you ran a stop sign in the parking lot on the way to Starbucks because you were in such a hurry to get your coffee. I was carrying my 7mo baby walking right next to the stop sign that you ignored. I also yelled RUDE! I know you heard me because the back window was open.
