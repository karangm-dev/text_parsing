This one was a tough one to decide upon a rating. Some dishes came out full of flavour but mine was a complete miss.  So I gave them the benefit of the doubt and rounded up my 1.5.The good news was the Blackened Chicken Bowties.  A very flavourful dish and the pasta was nicely done to al dente.  Also a generous portion.The bad news was the 'attempt' at their Herbed Brie Double Chicken. It was advertised as a double chicken breast however I got the leg and thigh of what looked like a cornish game hen.  The 'brie' portion was minimal and was over-whelmed with the red pepper sauce.  It looked great on the menu but what was delivered fell well short.Service was okay throughout the night so that was a positive.
