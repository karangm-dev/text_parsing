Funny enough this is my neighborhood Circle K absolutely no where to park but I find a way to make it work. I enjoy going to this one in particular because of the staff, real cool people considering they have to deal with rich snobs all day long not to mention the fact that it's alongside my favorite pizza joint TJ's  what more can I say!!!
