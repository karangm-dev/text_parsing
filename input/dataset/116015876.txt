Their chicken quesadillas and nachos were great, but I wasn't a fan of their tacos. The soft taco wrapping was really thin so it broke and the inside of the tacos kept falling out. The fish taco was probably the best one but it wasnt the best fish taco I've had, the chicken and the steak were very bland.
