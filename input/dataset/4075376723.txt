Fun place with three floors and three distict themes.  I visited the "Meatball" restaurant called Emporia on the first floor and the rooftop bar with a retractable roof on floor three, Il Trello.  Crowded but fun crowd.  Great service.  Third floor menu is really small and appetizers only.  It advertises bar food but you won't find a meal here.  Make sure you get your name on the list for Emporia or have reservations for Italian on the second floor if you are there for more than a few drinks and some buffalo dip and chips.  I was expecting wings or a burger in Il Trello.  Nope.  That said, the buffalo chicken dip was awesome.  Emporio was a surprise.  A meatball restaurant?  Absolute genius.  Meatballs included pork, beef, chicken, vegie and weekly special options.  Lots's of coices from pastas to paninis to bowls and large sauce and extras options.  The combinations are endless.  I had a spicy pork meatball grinder with alfredo sauce, parmesan and bacon bits at the waiter's recommendation.  Not the healthiest choice but darn good.  Half a sandwhich and I was full.  Fries are huge portions and should be shared.  I should have bought a t-shirt as they are quite amusing.  I highly recommend.
