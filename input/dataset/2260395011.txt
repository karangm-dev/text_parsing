The restaurant was fairly quiet for a weekend with a hockey game. The staff were fairly quick to get us seated as we were part of a group of 13. Our server was friendly but very slow to get us our drinks. My wife asked for a baileys and coffee and the server said they had to brew a pot yet the coffee came back lukewarm. I joked that maybe they added extra baileys and it cooled down, no such luck. Our meals were terribly slow to come and they were incorrect on 4 of the 13 meals. Refills and other drinks were very slow to come and incorrect at times. The manager hovered around the front desk from time to time but never once walked around to see how any tables were doing including ours which was surprising considering our size and we were purchasing drinks with our meals. This is only the second time I have been there even though I live less than 5 minutes away and I will not be back.
