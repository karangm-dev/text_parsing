I recently moved back to Scottsdale and was looking for a new esthetician. I did a little research online and came across Celebrity Skin. They have impeccable reviews with multiple satisfied customers, so I decided to schedule an appointment. Just to clarify, there are two Jennifers so it can get a bit confusing. Jennifer S. (the owner), and Jennifer F. Jennifer F was available on the day and time that was convenient for me so I decided to schedule with her. I could not be happier with the service! She was so meticulous, knowledgable and took time to understand my skins needs and concerns. I'm so happy it only took me one attempt to find my new esthetician.
