Where do I start!? Came here for the first time today and was a little shocked at the prices; we were already sitting down with our two little ones and they were hungry so we weren't going to try and look for another place to eat. We ordered the fried pickles to start with, and wow! I could not believe the size of these things! Shortly after we got our meals, and once again the portions were huge! I finally understood why things were priced the way they were. Everything was sooo good; we will definitely eat here again!
