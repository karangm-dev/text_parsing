This was and continues to be the worst company I have ever worked with to move. Maybe my expectations are too high & I just used better companies in the past but this has been a nightmare. One of the guys in the 2 man crew had an attitude and was very lazy and made the move over a hour longer than it needed to be because he was just standing around. By the end of the move, since the office was closed after 4pm, the same guy said well I'll just take pictures of your CC for payment. I was not about to give someone photos of my credit card... what kind of business is this. After repeated attempts to contact them, I just spoke with the office manager who was short with me and very rude. She stated I should have had the owners number to call after hours, this was never given to me. Currently waiting to hear from the owner.
