Seriously disappointing. I should have just grabbed Chinese food from Panda Express...it would have been better. My boyfriend had grabbed lunch here and liked their Panag Curry. When he was leaving they told him they'd been voted Best in the Valley for Chinese food 3 years in a row, which after trying it I can say is a blatant lie.We got Mongolian Beef, Sesame Chicken and Beef Chow Mein. The Mongolian Beef was the best of the 3, but was still MEH, at best. The Sesame Chicken was dry and the sauce was not like any sesame chicken sauce I've ever had, and not in a good way. Also, it came on a bed of shredded lettuce, which was very offputting for me. The Chow Mein was not even chow mein by any definition! On top of that the beef in it was extremely dry and flavorless.  We LOVE Chinese leftovers, but this was so crummy we threw the leftovers away.
