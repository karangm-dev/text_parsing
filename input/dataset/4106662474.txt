One of the best places in Scottsdale for happy hour. The outdoor patio of Diego pops is awesome. Food is great ( get the nachos ), soup is awesome too- there is so much chicken. It's location is awesome and is a great spot for drinks. I am at Diego pops a few times a month for happy hour 5/5 stars. I highly recommend Having David as a server- super friendly and helpful.
