We went here with a large group for both dinner and breakfast. We were disappointed both times. For dinner, there was a wide assortment of dishes, but many tasted mediocre. Breakfast was even more disappointing, with a too-long-to-stand-on omelette line, few other egg choices (they need two omelette stations and another station for regular eggs), and not enough interesting fare to warrant the cost. Worse, they charge a usurious 18% service fee for parties of 8 or more, yet they do nothing for that money--didn't offer to get drinks or water or coffee, and barely bussed the tables. Not at all worth the cost.
