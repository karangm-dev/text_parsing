Fantastic! Think, Subway or Chipotle's ordering concept, but with pizza. You pay a standard price and can get as many toppings as you want. Speaking of, their topping choices are numerous and unique offering endless pizza building options. If you aren't in the mood to build your own pizza you can order one of their signature pies. It's a great place for vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores alike. The service is very quick and the staff is very courteous and personable. I'm always greeted with a smile and "thank you". In Summary:+ Great Food (variety, healthy, quality, unique)+ Good Service+ Fun Location (despite being in congested uptown)+ Good Price
