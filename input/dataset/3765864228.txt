Mr. G's has some of the best pizza in town! We love the pepperoni pizza and the sausage pizza!! Whenever we do make it there, there is always a wait to get a table but it's worth the wait..! The wait for our food is also a little long just because there is a lot of people there too. Our waitress was very nice and helpful. but most of the time we order out so enjoy!
