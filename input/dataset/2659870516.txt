I can't believe I would EVER give a car dealership a great rating... However this one deserves it. Every time I have ever bought a car at a dealer I never leave happy. I always feel touched in the wrong way. I worked with Kiwi and it was absolutely the best car buying experience you could have. I never once felt pressured, worried or had anxiety. The fact that there isn't the sales managers makes it already better than every other place in town! They don't have paint add ons or bogus 90 day warranties. They give you KBB for your trade and I think the whole process was 3 hours. After this modern, not skeevy, approachable car buying experience- I would literally never go anywhere else. Please don't change as I will continue to recommend.
