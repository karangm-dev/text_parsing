We ended up booking this hotel last minute because we found ourselves stranded in Vegas due to a dust storm. Unfortunately the room was just as dusted. Doors, walls, the tub ALL Dirty, no blankets on the bed, had to ask for air conditioner remotes that took forever, wifi connection was a joke. Just an all around disappointing experience.
