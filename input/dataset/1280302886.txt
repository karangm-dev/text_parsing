I have eaten Mexican food extensively throughout the entire SW USA for many years.   Juan's Flaming Fajitas & Cantina have the best Fajitas that I have ever eaten anywhere, bar none!   They bring the Fajitas to the table and then throw on a large shot of clear liquor which instantly burst into flames.   We get the Steak Fajitas and the meat is deliciously flavored, soft - not dry and hard as so often they are else where, and mouth watering!   Of course you get the Nachos served immediately with both a hot dip and a hot bean dip.   With the Fajitas for 2 you get a very tasty cup of soup and then a large platter with rice and beans which are delicious.   The decor is simple with an outside eating area offered as well.   The service is fantastic, attentive and always give you the feeling they really want you to enjoy your meal with them.   On our second visit, though not our waiter, the waiter who had served us the last time checked on us several times to insure we were enjoying ourselves.   He actually remembered us from our first visit.   You can tell the staff enjoys working together and insuring that each customer enjoys their visit with them.   It has become our number one place to take visitors to eat and they are always impressed with the quality, amount and taste of their food!
