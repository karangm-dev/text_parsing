Started off with the home made chips/salsa.  At first I didn't care for the salsa; which I think was because of the texture, but ended up liking it.  Has a nice kick.  The meals on the other hand could have been better.  For the shrimp enchilada they fold the tortilla shell and put 1-2 shrimp on top of it, while it seemed only stuffed with melted cheese.  While the shrimp wasn't bad tasting, I felt like I was just eating a bunch of tortilla shell.  Husband had the shrimp fajitas.  If you're a Mexican restaurant, I feel the fajita should come out on a sizzling cast iron pan and the tortillas should be warmed/served in a container w/ a lid.  Shrimp/veggies all served on a plate with the tortillas wrapped in foil.  Presentation is EVERYTHING!!!!!  Also had a mojito & fried ice cream; both of which were good.  Would have given 3 stars if I was more impressed with the main courses.
