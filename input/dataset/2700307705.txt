I am incredibly frustrated. Apparently a company called Fitness 10 bought the company and I was never notified. All phone numbers have been disconnected and I've been trying to cancel my membership. I finally got a hold of a guy named Daniel, the GM of the Blue Diamond location. I asked him to refund my last payment as I wasn't able to get through to them, he told me to dispute it with my bank... Um, no. Why should I have to jump through more hoops to get my money back? He said it wasn't them that billed me but also said that they bought the business in January. I was billed on 2/23/17, which was clearly after they took ownership so why should I have to call my bank and go through that process? Why can't I just get a reversal of the charge??? Bad business practices and a messy transition.
