Our dog had always been a homebody but since we were lplanning a trip and could not take him we had to find a place he and my husband would be ok with.  His first visit was a little scary but after the "playground" greeting he got more relaxed and excited about playing with other dogs.  His behavior has gotten so good because he thinks if he is good he can go visiting so we have to take him at least once a week as a reward.  The prices are good enough that it doesn't kill the budget.Thanks All
