This place is amazing! The whole family ordered something different so it was good to have a bite of everything! We had a snicker doodle cookie, it was a million times better than I have ever made! A dirt cup that was so sweet I was grateful for the size. Birthday cake, mocha and snickers macaroons, I'm not sure what my favorite was. They were all so unique and delicious! A rice crispy treat with a thick layer of Carmel on top drizzled and dipped in chocolate..Amazing! I was really impressed with this place and will definitely recommend and return!
