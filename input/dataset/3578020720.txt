This was an awesome gastropub! We went here yesterday for a date night and were not disappointed! There was a little bit of a wait if you wanted an actual table but it wasn't long and it was a Saturday night so what else can you expect. Our waiter was great. He was very helpful with suggestions of food and beer. He also let us know about the specials they offer throughout the week. We ordered the kale Caesar salad, bangers and mash, and bison burger. Everything was fantastic! My fianc√© enjoyed his beers as well. The service was also very quick but we didn't feel rushed or anything.    We also loved the atmosphere and the decor. We would definitely come back here. I can't wait to try the rest of their menu.
