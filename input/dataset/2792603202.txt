Great beer menu, nice atmosphere but just too much.Too much grease, too much cheese, too long of a wait.  I love to eat.  I'll eat all damn day.  Cheese, Butter.. put it on my ice cream.  But this was just overdoing it.  Oily cheese, oily bread.  Obesity, please continue your takeover of the Midwest.The wait once you sit is also long.  This place can probably seat 150 people (total guess), but we were a table of 6 with probably 20 other people there.  Everything seemed like a wait.  Wait to order, wait for drinks, wait for food.I see how some people will get off to 50 different kinds of grilled cheese sandwich (which is what drew me in, along with many recommendations), but this place just rubbed me the wrong way.
