Our #1 place for fresh fish, here in the Arizona desert, and for steaks that absolutely melt in your mouth. Be sure to try their renowned pineapple upside down cake and the molten chocolate cake, both are baked to order. You have never tasted anything like Roy's take on Asian fushion, and somebody told me the food is all spicy but that is not so! The blending of flavors is deftly accomplished, so that no one ingredient ever stands out excessively. Service is attentive. And I do not know of ANY other place that makes your special celebration day this special, and it is accomplished in the most elegant style. We celebrated our wedding anniversary here last night, and we were treated like visiting royalty. Perfect!
