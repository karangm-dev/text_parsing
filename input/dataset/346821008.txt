I don't know why we continue to eat here. I always think to myself, "Hey, maybe it will be better this time." It never is.After a night of drinking, this place somehow ends up being on our list of restaurants for hangover pho mostly for it's convenient location on State Street. Every soup I've had here has tasted extremely watered down and I feel like I would be better off just eating instant pho. I've tried a couple of other things that aren't pho including the salt and pepper squid which always seem to be just way too salty. The only thing I've had here that was palatable was the kimchi fried rice, but even that isn't anything special.The cleanliness of this place is kind of questionable, I've been served food on dishes that weren't the cleanest. Service here is also usually pretty slow despite the fact that this place always seems to be pretty dead. If you want pho, don't have a car, and don't mind walking a bit, I would definitely try Nam's Noodle instead. If you do have a car, Saigon Noodle isn't that far either.Something tells me I'll probably still be back again, but my gut tells me it won't be any better.
