The big guy that worked there wasn't very friendly. Took him a while to even acknowledge I entered the store when there was only one other customer vaping. This store is dark and Smokey with limited selection in terms of tanks. Like the other yelpers said, this guy clearly didn't want to be there. Will not go back again.
