We expected this to be nice, but were shocked at how wonderful this experience was.  You walk into the main entrance of the library and the guides let you know you start over with the cow.  You then go through a timed and guided tour by guides with videos, presentations and traditional museum artifacts.   A fantastic display of the life of Billy Graham and who Jesus Christ is.  Take the time to go see the childhood house and where Billy and his wife are buried. I would be confident that even if you weren't s believer, this place would be worth your while.  Such a fantastic museum. And it's all free.  The guides are all over the place and amazingly friendly.  A MUST if you are in Charlotte.  Whole visit is 2-3 hours
