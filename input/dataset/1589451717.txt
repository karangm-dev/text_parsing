Booking trough allegiant Cost me an additional 300 because they were delayed for 3 hours, their idea for a resolution was booking me on a flight the following week. Not really an option when you're on 1 week vacation. customer service got worse as I spoke to more people, it's almost appalling. I've never felt as helpless or stuck. Don't spend your money with them... Please!
