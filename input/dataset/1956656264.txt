It has been a while but my only experiences with this place have been resoundingly tourist-trappyIt is a lovely place to sit so I would go back for that.but they have an extremely high-profit meny of crepes and pizza and crappy salads so that they make a whole lot of money selling you flour.If you are in the old port and want a glass of beer and live music go here.  For a good meal go to china town or to Amir's or something.  Do not fall into the tourist trap!
