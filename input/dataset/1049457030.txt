Perfect smoked salmon, to be enjoyed very fresh.Because Kristapsons is cold smoked using a bare minimum of other ingredients, it is not salty and does not 'need' cream cheese to 'cut' any salty flavor (traditional lox is primarily salt-preserved and very salty, hence this smoked salmon is not lox.)Cold-smoking is also very healthy preserving vital Omega fats your body and brain needs for effective metabolism. This is smart food.Kristapsons is mild and tasty enough to enjoy very simply on a platter with a generous squeeze of organic lemon and fresh-ground pepper, maybe some paper-thin shavings of very fresh red onion. Like you're eating sashimi or carpaccio. To me that's better than the puffy bun and capers, etc etc. Alternatively could omit the dousing of lemon juice and nosh the salmon along with white wine (because strong acids and wine do not play well together.)Expensive-ish, I think nearly doubled in cost the past ten years, but then so did your GTA home value. You still need to eat well and there's far worse ways here. Bon app√©tit.
