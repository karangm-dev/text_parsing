I started liking this place after I tried the iced Aztec Mocha.  Strong and delicious with a taste of mexican chocolate and cinnamon.  I've tried hot coffee and it's smooth.  Tried the iced chai latte and it needed sugar, I guess I was expecting something closer to the Starbucks, like really sweet.....Have had their bacon/jalapeno frittata and it's sooo good.  Not at all spicy like I thought, but definetely a taste of chile with some chunks of potatoe and chunks of cheese.Never mind my sweet tooth, I enjoy supporting this local place.  The barista is always so nice and quick!  Haven't tried the teas because I'm intimated by all the different selections.  I agree with another post, the sign does remind me of FreddyKruger too!! :)  Sometimes I worry their location doesn't give them enough justice to how great this little place is.
