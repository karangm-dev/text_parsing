Dr. Bond and his staff were amazing from the time I went in for my consult to the surgery and even more so, post-op. They were great about getting me in for wisdom teeth extraction quickly and the wait to see Dr. Bond at my appointments was never long. He has great bedside manner and makes you feel relaxed. I had a lot of questions after my surgery and everyone was very caring and concerned about my level of comfort. The office staff & Dr. Bond were even friendly & helpful with my 3 kids I had to bring with me to two appointments. I'm very picky when it comes to my family's health and I highly recommend this practice!
