Place is amazing so is the music BUT be very careful how much they charge you for a drink.. My friends and I were there on Saturday September 3,  2016 and for the same drinks the price was  different every single time! First drink was 10$ then one hr later I was changed 8$ per drink and some of my friends paid 12 $ for the same drink.. We always leave great tips as well but don't assume we are drunk or can't do the math! Make sure you pay attention to the bill every single time!  Update: We purchased the drinks between 11:30 pm and 1 am.. I don't think there is a happy hr at that time especially on a Saturday night and if there is we weren't informed! I understand everyone wants to make a quick buck but honesty is the key for any success!!!
