**UPDATE**Wow! Worth the wait! My eyelashes are amazing! They look completely natural and my eyes look huge. I really enjoyed my visit with Sarah. She explained the entire process and gave clear instructions for after care. She is very personal and you can tell (and she'll tell you) she loves what she does. So happy with my visit. More eyelash technicians are starting soon and I'm sure they will give the same quality of care as Sarah does. I will have to update this review if I ever have my eyelashes done here. At this time, however, I am extremely frustrated with the scheduling and customer service. I purchased a Groupon in August to get my eyelashes done. There were no appointments available until the end of September. I scheduled an appointment for Sept 28. On September 28, as I was driving to the appointment, ten minutes before my appointment, they called me and said there has been an emergency and they would have to reschedule my appointment. I said no problem, the girl on the phone said she'd call me back and reschedule tomorrow. So Tuesday comes and goes and Wednesday I call back to see when we can reschedule. The girl on the phone recognized me and had said she was sorry for not calling me back she didn't know which "Amy" I was. We reschedule for Sunday - even though they aren't open Sunday. So today I drive out there and call to find the place because it's kinda hidden and the girl who answered was rather short with me and said I didn't have an appointment and I had to reschedule AGAIN for Wednesday. Long story short, if a company is going to charge a $75 same day cancellation policy I think they owe me $150 for cancelling on me twice.
