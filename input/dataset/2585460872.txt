Leigh is an amazing injector who takes the time to provide her clients with the best correction using less product than others with less experience.  Results are natural. She is educated in many types of filler so can choose the right one for each client and concern.  Her space is beautifully decorated, clean and professional. The Babyface line of products is excellent.  She also offers dermaplaning, which makes your skin soft and fuzz free.  I highly recommend Leigh and have sent many friends to her.
