Love that this new location is in the southwest! The pizza and wings are top notch, nothing like it in Vegas. It's solid, real food for good prices. You can feed your whole family easily. The pizza is amazing but the wings are also fantastic. I love the Sicilian ones- herby and garlicky! Stop in today and give them some of your business. You can even order using the yelp app and grab it on the way home. Quit ordering from chain pizza places!!
