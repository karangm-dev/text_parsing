okay.. It hurts to say this because I thought so highly of this place before I moved in, but I moved in here 3 days ago and I feel like it was the worst mistake Ive made apartment wise. If I could get my money back and get the heck out of this apartment I would. First of all the customer service is horrific...No one in the office ever has the same story...talked to 3 different people then they all give me different answers.. EVERYTIME! Then, like I said I moved in here 3 days ago but yet this apartment looks like the previous owners moved out the day before. Nothing was cleaned(walls, baseboard, bathroom) my sink is clogged, lights are out. Toilet seat look like its been used for a couple years and was never cleaned or switched. Im really stressed..Never had to deal with this at any other apartment I went too. Then when people are suppose to come service my house my always get refused and no one every knows the answer why things weren't done then I have to suffer. Worst living decision I have made honestly. Doesn't make it better that the people here all think they are better than you. THIS PLACE IS A TOTALLY TRAINWRECK. I am so pissed. oh by the way the leasing office people can be quite condescending so be cautious of that... Wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy...
