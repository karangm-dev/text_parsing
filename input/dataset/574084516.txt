This place is awesome!! Neelu does a great job on my eyebrows. I'm always scared to try someone new but when my regular lady went on vacation I had to find a new place and I was pleasantly surprised not only at the $7 price tag but also how gentle and precise she is. This last time I decided to get henna tattoo for my birthday and I love it!! Definitely my regular spot to go to highly recommended.
