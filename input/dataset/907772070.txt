I had a great experience. Tattoo artist Travis was professional, the whole staff was friendly and I absolutely love my tattoo! This is my 3rd tattoo and it's been many years since the last two but I wouldn't change a thing! Would much rather pay a little more for a great tattoo from a seasoned staff than go to a place where you don't know what you're getting. Thanks Starlight!
