My wife and I went today to Galaxy Outdoor and had a wonderful experience. The woman who greeted us upon entering was nice and not pushy, she advised us to wander around, take our time, and when we needed some help to let her know. When we were ready for some help and questions to be answered, Bruce, the owner was standing nearby, and he asked his salesman Caesar to follow us and he took us around and showed us all the different stainless barbeques, showed us where they build their own islands, gazebos and fire pits. Bruce is extremely knowledgeable, and honest about the bbq's and their features. This is not my first bbq and I know my way around a quality bbq when I see one. The quality of their build for their islands is 10 times stronger than anyone else, and they take pride in what they do. Their prices are very competitive with anyone else's that sells quality bbq's. We are definitely going to buy from them, it's just that we got so many additional ideas from  Bruce and Caesar that we now have to place some blue tape on the ground for our expanded island ideas to see how much Real Estate it takes up in our backyard. When we get it all figured out we will definitely be back!!
