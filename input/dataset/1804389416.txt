I love this place and LOVED coming here as a kid and watching the train move around on the ceiling tracks. I travelled here many times with my grandparents who are local to the area and really had a lot of fun times here. Unfortunately, my grandfather has passed on, but that's beside the point. After a recent remodel, and having a meeting in the area, I decided I would revisit my old "stomping ground."  It really has changed and for the better. It looks old timey inside, almost like you're in a 60s restaurant. There is even a Mustang BUILT into the side of the establishment. How cool!! Customer service as always was great and the food was superb. A+ I would recommend this place to everyone! If you want a good burger at a place that is the best around, come here!
