Yes Chino! The Gods of Chinese, Mexico, and Caribbean fusion have answered my pleas! THIS is the chino I know and love, and have frequented since forever. I have in front of me a tin of deliciousness filled to the brim, an extra snickerdoodle, and I'm sporting a gigantic grin that can only be caused by this sort of food euphoria. What's more important, the old chino is back on the inside too! And that's what counts right? I was greeted by a friendly girl who offered to help with ordering, and several people were smiling and looked like they were enjoying the bustling Sunday night atmosphere. Speaking of bustling, it was! And it felt great, all sorts of energy in the room and all positive vibes. I doubt my previous reviews had anything to do with it, maybe I just got unlucky a few times...but whatever it is, chino is back to its rightful place at the forefront of my mind and heart, and it retakes it's reign as the absolute best and most unique dining experience in Phoenix. Here's lookin at you chino, you absolute legend.
