We have previously eaten at this Streets of New York in the evenings or on weekends and found the food and service to be good; however, today we went for lunch with a different result. The waiter took the drink order, but did not bring it to the table for another 10 minutes and had the order wrong. Took another 8 minutes to correct the order. Next he took the food order without writing it down and he was uninformed about menu options. He came back to the table twice to get the order correct never actually writing it down. The salads were brought to the table about 13 minutes after his second order clarification. When he brought the pizza slice orders some 15 minutes after ordering, he indicated that the wings were not done yet. Then he came to the table again telling us the wing order got mixed up with a catering order and he had to have them to remake our order. We cancelled them since we had already been there for a long time and were done eating what had already been served. The service was poor and slow except for the gentleman serving the bread baskets who was prompt and kind. There seemed to be major communication challenges from the table to the kitchen. Writing down the order would have helped the situation! Members of our party entered the restaurant at 11:00 am and we finally paid around 12:15.
