This place is amazing! We always eat here every time we visit Vegas. Their lunch menu is very reasonable. For only $25, you can chose from a selection of appetizers, an main course and a dessert. I loved all the dishes here. Reservation is recommended .Looking forward to the next meal at Estiatorio Milos again soon :)
