Yogurt is fine but the staff are not consistent with purchase of products.  3 months of going there & staff know they offer a 25% discount when you purchase the extra large cup. However, other evening went in got my extra large cup, filled it up & the owners son told me they have never offered 25% off!! He was very rude.  I was not there to argue - so I just walked out. So frustrating cause the little store is so close to home. Just wish they'd get there act together:(
