For the "inn" only: stayed here in the honeymoon suite for two nights leading up to my wedding. Excellent and accommodating staff, nice old timey decor, and plenty comfy. There was lots of room for the ladies to get ready here on the wedding day. Overall, excellent value with attentive staff for a boutique style B&B.
