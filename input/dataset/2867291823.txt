We had the best time with BG Wild!!!  Food was great, the adventures were amazing and we did things that we wouldn't have had the opportunity to do if hadn't have been for Josh and Daniel.  They showed us such a great time.  They truly are FUN guides!!!  ;) The campsite is in a great location.  Close to bathrooms and the spring.  I would absolutely recommend BG Wild.  Well worth the money.
