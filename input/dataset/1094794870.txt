I love pizza and would consider Pizza Hut my favourite chain. This location on Morningside happens to be the closest and most convenient for me. Unfortunately, this location also has the worst quality of pizza I have ever had. Almost every time I've ordered there, the pizza has had no cheese and/or is undercooked. Last time I decided to show the staff my pizza with no cheese. They apologized and made a new pizza, which is now undercooked AND still had no cheese. If you enjoy eating dough and pizza sauce I would highly recommend this place. As for me, I'm never going back. Life's too short for less than mediocre pizza.
