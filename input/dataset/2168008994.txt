I went here with a few kids on an outing. The people who own this place are extremely rude! Not good with children at all. The machines are cool but I would never take kids here again. The way that the man talked to one of the children in my group was horrible, one of the machines stole the kids money and when the kid told the man he snapped at the child and told him "hurry up pick another machine! You don't understand me? Pick a machine!!" Also the woman who was there was yelling at the children and was not patient at all. I understand that some of the machines are worth a lot of money but she was eyeballing the kids as soon as they came in just waiting to shout at them. It was uncomfortable for everyone involved.
