I have been here several times and the service is pretty poor.  From the service dept to parts, it seemed as if I was an inconvienece to them.  I will do business with them as needed. When I get a choice I go somewhere else, even if it cost me a little more.They seem to be very knowedgable but thats where it ends.  Store is very clean and well maintained.
