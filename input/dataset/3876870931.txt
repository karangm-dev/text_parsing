I try to avoid this Starbucks, but it's the only one on the way to my moms .   Not only are wait lines insane...your wait time is even long when you're the only one in there!!!   Every time I order they mess up the order...today...they got the wrong drink...then the wrong food...not even an apology.  It's time to visit your local coffee shop...looks like Starbucks could care less about customer service... #toobigtocare
