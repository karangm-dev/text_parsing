We frequent Roy's often. The food is always spot on, until this evening. Wife and son ordered fish, I ordered filet - medium.  Fish was cooked to perfection. Can't say that for my steak. First appeared rare. Sent it back. Steak came back with outer skin very warm but center still rare. Send it back again. 3rd time steak is butterflied, I'm ok with that as long as the steak is not over cooked. Well it was well done.  Manager "Steve" never came to table to address this disaster. I sat and watched my family eat a great dinner. I'm happy they enjoyed dinner. Wish I could have did the same.  It will be a while before we think about going back.
