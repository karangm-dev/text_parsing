Friendly and well stocked. The customer service here is Top Notch as the staff go above and beyond to ensure that every customer is Happy.We have shopped this Trader Joes for three years and counting (since moving to NC) and they never cease to amaze me. I had my son Nov.2014 and while shopping in Feb.2015 the staff noticed that the baby was born and presented me with a beautiful bouquet of flowers as a baby gift. I was so excited and appreciative I nearly cried.The veggies and fruit are priced great and very tasty and fresh. I like the fact that if something isn't to your liking once you get home you can return it with no issues nor receipt (I try to keep my receipts but it's good to know if I lost it I would be okay while returning something). Wine tastings on the weekend are always perfect and we just discovered this weekend that there is a parking lot out back WHO KNEW??! We totally sit in the front lot and wait for a space and the lot was our only disregard about Trader Joes but now knowing that there is a lot out back I think they deserve all 5 stars I'm providing :-)
