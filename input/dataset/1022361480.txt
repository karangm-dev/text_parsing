Was able to get in for 2 pedicures late on a Friday evening. No rushing, no short cuts, very attentive, and finished both our services even after closing time. My husband was very happy with his much-needed pedicure. I also got a gel mani, and my nails are gorgeous. Thank you to Kimberly, for doing an excellent job. Other places will file and file and file your nails down until they are paper thin and practically peeling. But Kimberly kept my natural nails intact. I absolutely LOVE my Easter nails! We will definitely return :)
