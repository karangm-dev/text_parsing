I had out of town guests to the club for a semi quiet night knowing the nature of Scottsdale on a Friday. We decide to go to Dakota for a drink and come home 3 blocks away. We were unable to get in on our first attempt due to dress code requirements. We went home and changed our sandals to meet the requirements and when we came back we were told we could not enter due to not having passports. Craig, the manager asked us to "convince him" which I assume meant to give him more money to enter. At that point I told him that the people who work for him are dumbasses for not checking ID and asking for more valid ID. He was asking for two forms of ID from people from the Czech Republic. A passport is valid anywhere in the world which is what was presented at the time and all valid. Craig decided he didn't like me calling his employees dumbasses and pushed me into another lady patron, knocking us both to the floor. Then, my wife decided to stand up for me and tell Craig that he could not push her husband down (embarrassing) and punched her in the face. Not professional or legal I'm pretty sure. When I asked him for his name, he would not give his last name as I'm sure he did not want to be recognized for what he had done. My wife, who I am so incredibly grateful for, kept me from going back to call the police and/or doing harm to Craig. I hope that anyone deciding to go to Dakota will consider the possibility of a violent and incredibly, unbelievably, horrific night.
