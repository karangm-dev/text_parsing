If I could do no stars I would. Had a hot stone pedicure from the owner Ben. It was the most painful non relaxing experience. I asked him to ease up more than once & he continued to be very aggressive. He cut me three times. It concerned me because I saw them using the same tool on multiple clients without sterilizing anything. I also had a gel manicure by one of the girls & the wrong color was applied. The number on the sample was incorrect & somehow I was supposed to know that. The owners girlfriend insinuated that I should have known it was 32 instead of 36 even though it clearly said 36. Very poor customer service! I'm positive you can find a much more pleasant nail salon in Las Vegas!!!
