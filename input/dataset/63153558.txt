My dog Ziggy has been there several times with no issue.  The worse thing that happened was that he would hit the lock on his pen that it rubbed a spot on his nose.  This time he got his paw stuck on a chain link fence that was near his pen.  It drew blood.  We were out of town but I had a local friend who should have been contacted.  I found out the next day that this happened.  What they did was to keep him isolated from other dogs in the same pen where he got injured!  I had my friend pick him up and take him to another friend who could watch him.  Also when she came, they did not check her ID!  She had to tell them to do that!   The only way to get him out was for me to pay $120 (he was there since Wednesday).  That also did not make any sense since I had paid a $40 deposit.  Fortunately all is good now but I will never send Ziggy back there again.
