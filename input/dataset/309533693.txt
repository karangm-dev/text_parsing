My family and I have been here for breakfast and lunch several times and love it!  Their outdoor patio is covered, dog friendly and you can sit at the bar outside as well.  Their food is American Contemporary in my opinion.  They have a great selection of breakfast and lunch items.  My person favorite are their breakfast potatoes.  They are crispy and not too oily.  If you are a Mexican food lover I highly recommend "The Other Burrito" for breakfast.  Super flavorful and it has a good kick!  The interior of the restaurant is simply modern, which I love.  It's always clean and even if the restaurant is busy you will get sat within 15-20 minutes usually.  Get a bloody mary while you wait!  :)
