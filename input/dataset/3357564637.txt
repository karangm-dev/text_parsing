Extremely slow drink service. Each drink took about 10 minutes to get to the table. Food was just okay and after all the waiting and poor service we were given a bill of 64 dollars for one app and 4 drinks. My double skky mixer was 12 dollars. Aka a full price single simply doubled, which, as a bartender I can tell you makes no sense. After expressing our concerns, the manager came over and was nothing but confrontational saying that was just the policy and too bad. I said okay that's fine just run my card and he continued to explain things away when I clearly had no further desire to talk to him. Pretty brutal experience.
