I would love to say I enjoyed my cupcake and I might have if I hadn't almost DIED first. Stopped in to get a cupcake with my son. I ordered the salted caramel, it looked delicious and the "caramel" popcorn on top was a nice added touch. As soon as I took my first bite I knew I was in TROUBLE. I have a peanut allergy and this cupcake sent me into instant anaphylaxis I ran inside with my toddler son in tow just to make sure I hadn't missed something on the sign about nuts. NOPE. I walked over to the cashier swollen tongue and all and asked if there were nuts in any part of the cupcake. She looked incredibly disinterested and also a little confused. The confusion was understandable since I was having problems talking!!! I asked for a Coke to help rinse some of the peanut oil off of my tongue and headed home to for my epinephrine followed by a trip to the ER. I have tried twice to follow up with a manager but the phone keeps ringing and there is no voicemail. Please educate your employees about allergies and make sure you aren't cross contaminating and if that's your prerogative, some signage would be nice. I gave you one star because before my life flashed before my eyes I remember the cupcake being moist.
