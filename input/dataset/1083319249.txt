Love this nail salon. I happened to find this place since it's across the street from my kids preschool. I have been getting the SNS manicure. It's better than gel, last twice as long and it has made my nails longer and healthier. The SNS lasts 3-4 weeks and they still look great. Could last longer except the growth is what finally gets me in to have them re-done. I have never once had a nail chip, lift or break. Definitely worth trying if you are tired of getting gel nails every 2 weeks and gel always lifting and coming up
