Somebody tried breaking into our room while i was in the tub and Hubby was in the shower, THANK GOD i had the latch locked. They had a key and couldn't open the door because of the latch..Scared the S*** out of me. He was banging and kicking the door.  This might have happened at another hotel, but how the F*** did somebody get our room key????!!!!!!!?????!!!!!
