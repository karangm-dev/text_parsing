Best ice cream in Las Vegas, definitely! The cashier was super friendly and pleasant, and the ice cream was wonderful. Watch out for the large sizes though, they don't give you scoops, but rather pack the entire cup. I recommend the chocolate and bacio, the bacio is a Nutella hazelnut that taste like a light chocolate, while the chocolate is a lot darker.
