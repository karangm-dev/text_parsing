I wish I could give a zero star my husband and I fell homeless and grateful we were at a shelter but we decided to move there after I got a job so we stayed there with the help of my mother in law first the 198 a week sign they had out there is a lie because we paid 268 I had to work and without an ID for myself which I had my husband check in he fell ill and ended up in the hospital never had the chance to add me to the lease so the next week when my mother in law paid the payment the lazy office people didn't process her payment so I got locked out and ended to having to spend the night in a casino until visiting hours to see my husband they refused to left me in the following week I got locked out again because my key wouldn't work and the people in the office were so rude to me threw the key back at me and said nothing we can do leave the property so at this point we have given them almost a 1,000 but they won't let me in. My neighbor got the door unlocked for me and I had to keep my window open so I could slide it so I can get in at this point I rather live in a homeless shelter because at least I was respected when we have paid almost 1,000 for three weeks once my husband was released we moved to a co worker we are still trying to get the 50 dollar deposit find somewhere before this place with bugs everywhereStill no deposit back I don't understand why? It was clean they said 4 to six weeks don't ever stay here don't don't don't make the same mistake we did because we were desperate!!  Do research don't ever stay here!!!!!
