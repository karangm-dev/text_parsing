I am a healthcare executive and have been in the business for over 30 years.  I have seen this practice for two years and have had positive results until today, of which, totally trumps the couple of positive visits.  I had a procedure done in Dec, which did not work, so they needed to increase the amount.  At the time, they had a 40% off sale for the procedure over the holidays.  The day before the reschedule, they had to cancel due to a shortage of product but stated they would honor the price since both the ineffective product and the reschedule were both as a result of the practice.  Once the procedure was performed, they wanted to charge me full price.  The office manager was inexperienced and basically stated we will bill you and then turn you over to collections.  I have an impeccable financial record and to be talked to both without honoring the promise, and in addition the threat, is a totally unacceptable practice.  Their quality is similar to many practices, but the patient experience is equally important and this is totally unacceptable and would hope that many will take the time to read and to seek other providers for their services.
