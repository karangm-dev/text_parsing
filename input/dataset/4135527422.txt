Starving for lunch and found this on Yelp. Very cute inside. Food is more on the gourmet end of Mexican with applewood smoked meats. LOVED our food! Very homemade... great plate presentation...so yummy! Chef came to our table before we ordered to explain why there were so many items unavailable. Didn't matter! I had a combo of chile relleno and steak enchilada. Chef made a lamb burrito for my partner. We both agreed - Best Mexican found we've had any where in a very long time!
