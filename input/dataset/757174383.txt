I picked up my car in the Newark Airport location - which by the way, isn't actually in the airport.  You have to take a shuttle bus from the airport to get to the Wyndham hotel where the Advantage location is.The major issue for me was a billing problem.  They charged me an additional $149 for an extension that I never asked for.  They said they had record of me calling customer service for an extension and that never happened.  I rented the car for a week and returned it EARLY in fact, so I don't know where this extension came from.  In addition to the mistaken extension fee, they also changed the weekly rate.  The rate they had in the system was nearly twice what was listed on my contract.  When I called customer service about the issue they were not only unapologetic, but they were downright rude and dismissive.  Terrible experience.Luckily someone at the Newark location helped me in person and he was very courteous and apologetic of the fact that they had essentially charged me double.  They have said they will refund me the bogus charges that were added to my account and honor the rate that was on my contract, but the correct amount has yet to hit my account.  So far they have debited me $700 when I only owe them $345.  So yeah, thanks Advantage. Never, ever again.  I will go with Budget next time.
