Pizza looked great until I bit into it.  Way too much sauce on pizza. It was messy and sloppy to eat. Could not hold pizza in hand as it just falls apart. Hard to taste the ingredients with all the sauce. If you like lots of sauce and messy pizza then look no further. Interesting to get a comment about ones review. No the sauce did not taste good. No I could not enjoy the crust because my pizza was soggy from all the sauce.  Why is my rating unfair?  It is in fact MY review and again it was the worse pizza that I and my family tasted in OUR opinion.  Nothing you can do for us to try this pizza again. Sorry you did not like my review
