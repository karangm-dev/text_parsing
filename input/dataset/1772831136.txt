Not too bad, mostly with cardio equipment and machines, though. I had a free trial here, forgot to give the key back at the end of  the trial so I mailed it. Apparently it was 'lost in the mail' and was charged 35$ for the key!FYI- the current gym I go to has the same keys, I lost one and he gave me a replacement for FREE and said that it costs less than a dollar for one!
