Favorite chilis love natalie but most horrible service last week with manager that didn't do a great job either. Should have walked out when I found out natalie or jen was not there but decided to stay steak was dry (cooked medium) server never came back to check on us just because we are regulars doesn't mean we do not deserve the same service as any other customer.  We flagged manager down to let him know about steak and all he had to say was did you order dessert. .no!!! Would you like dessert uh no would have liked my steak redone but never offered I ended up just leaving. But to make things worse I asked for their District managers number and they didn't want to give it to me. I had it at home I called him and I've yet to get a response back on the issue, I wrote an email to the email that they gave me still nothing back from anyone I also went o  website to submit a comment for someone to contact me and a week later nothing. Everyone just be ware of service and management at this location if you so go in ask for natalie she will make sure your shit is right. So funny I am an assistant manager of a restaurant and it's crazy on how they run their business.
