Well , I have a true love to Café rio food . Any time I think about going out and getting some food all my friends would know that Café rio would be number 1 place for me to go . This location is really disappointing. I go there pretty often and each time I see new people working there . Last night the guy who was giving me rice , beans and meat for my salad seemed to be not even knowing what he was doing . His metal trays were empty and when I saw it , I asked myself "is he gonna refill it or serve the air ?" Well, he didn't refill it.   He literally gave me NOTHING . Same thing he was doing to other people . The guy behind me looked at it and decided to get double meat cause double would be barely an amount of regular .  The same thing he did to rice and beans . I just wonder does this food goes from employers'  paychecks ? I'm giving 2 stars because another employee ( the guy who was serving the rest my salad ) gave me a good amount of salad . So I basically was eating greenies with tortilla yesterday . Thank you Café rio for putting me on a diet .
