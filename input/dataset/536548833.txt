I'm halfway through my meal and had to stop and write a review.  The short version is that this is some of the best sushi and sashimi I have ever had.  I travel extensively across the US for work and have sushi a free times per month.  This is in the top three for flavor, and the best for value.  I stopped in yesterday based on the Yelp review, and am back again today on my way to the airport.  Outstanding both days.  The special fatty tuna they advertised on the display was probably the best sashimi I have ever had.  If you are nearby, give it a try.  Enjoy!
