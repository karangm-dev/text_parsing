The 1 star goes to the cooks who all were very nice. And the bartender who had a great attitude.  I liked the Cajun selection since I'm a big seafood fan but I highly disliked the fact that they didn't tell us they were going to close the buffet 30 minutes after we had entered. I think it is fair to let your customers, who are about to pay $50.00 per person, know that they have 30 mins left to eat. Beware of shady people, but they fit right in with all MGM casino who seems to want to take every person for every little thing !
