For an almost 40 yr old woman, this show was a lot of fun! Very Interactive! Lots of audience participation! Risque' but not slutty and the guys were total hunks! Me and my friend had so much not so clean fun! I like how intimate the venue is so I can have a good look at those six packs :) The VIP seats were definitely worth it! if you are planning a girls night out with a little edge without having to go to those seedy strip clubs, watching Thunder From Down Under is a a definite Must Do!
