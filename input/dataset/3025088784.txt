Took my wife for a special dinner. I was very disappointed. The baked potatoes were not at all fresh and skins were tough as a boot. I had asparagus that was so tough I could hardly cut it with a serrated knife let alone chew it. Samon should be firm and flakey but instead it was mushy. For a place that specializes in sea food, they do a poor job of preparation for the prices they charge. Will not eat there again.
