I have been to this Savers location, a few times over the past several months. However, I have noticed that they have increased their prices on some items, which seem to be unreasonably priced. Particularly, some of their electronics and clothing/shoes are overpriced for the quality and condition. It seems as if this store has accumulated a lot more junk recently. When shopping at any type of second-hand store, I don't expect for every item to be in perfect (almost new) condition. It is just very disappointing to go into this store and be charged $9.99 for a pair of run-over shoes. The only plus-side to Savers, is  the 30 % off (or other discount days), when you can actually save money for such items.
