Services seemed ok till I asked for an extra plate. Originally asked for it when we ordered. When the assistant brought the food I waited for him to come back with one and he didn't. Got his attention and asked for an extra plate. He acknowledged me and continued prepping tables for new customers. After two tables I asked him again and he acknowledged me. After TWO more tables, and me getting upset, he finally went and got one. The menu is a pain to look at. Pumpkin pancakes were ok/good. Potatoes were bland. Overall wasn't worth it and wouldn't come back.
