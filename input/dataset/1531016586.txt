Terrible service from delivery drivers.  I stayed home to wait for my package, and got a text that it had been delivered.  The driver never rang the doorbell.  Like most houses in San Francisco, there is no front yard, side yard, etc, just the gate or front  door right on the sidewalk.  There my package was, sitting out in front of my house, on the sidewalk, completely unsecured.  There was no attempt do anything but dump it there with no regard for it being stolen. I hate it when my Amazon packages ship from the huge Phoenix warehouse, b/c OnTrac is the worst delivery service in the US.
