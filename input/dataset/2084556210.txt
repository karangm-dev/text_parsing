Read great reviews about his shop and I happened to be in Tempe so I stopped by to get henna done.I walked in and I was never greeted. I asked who was doing henna today. She let me know that there is no one there today to do henna and that she could give me other locations to visit. At the last minute she said she could call someone in to do henna but it could take a little while for them to get there. I didn't have extra time to wait. Also, meter parking only, which I don't mind. However, today I paid $3 to park for less than 5 minutes :(
