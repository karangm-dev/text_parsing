I came to Hunk Mansion April 11th 2014 for my 40th Birthday, not knowing what to expect, I was down for anything at that moment. Thomas was so pleasant and helpful as we were greeted and given front side stage seating VIP TREATMENT! The men were respectful and very tasteful, giving all the ladies attention as if they were the only one in the room. I was given two stage performances ,one by "Ready", and boy was he READY! so was I lol, the other gentleman "Speedy" I guess was funny as hell. I recommend this place if you wanna have fun that never ends........ladies bring your wallet thing's can add up. Is it worth it ? Hell yea! Beware of Dave the MEANIE he's a driver for the mansion, he will pick you up , and drop you off back to your hotel if the PRICE is right! Otherwise your stuck at the mansion, he will politely text you and say "you didn't tip so no ride home! plus I'm off". I simply laughed , I'm from Oakland BABY, I can get down. lol staff handle the situation well providing drinks to me and my girls as they hooked up a ride for us. Would I return yes . Thanks for a wonderful night fellas. I do apologize for this late review .                                                                                                                                                   Tameikia
