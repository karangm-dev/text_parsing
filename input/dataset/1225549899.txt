I scheduled an appointment online for nails. I'm new to the area so I figured I'd give them a try! I get a call 30 minutes before saying they cant do it because they are short staffed because a nail tech is off today. Online I selected any nail tech and apparently I requested a guy which I didnt. The girl who calls me is like oh we dont have enough people and we have appointments too, as did I. I told them forget it and I'll go someplace else. She didnt even really seemed concerned. The online system should be updated due to staffing. Not my issue they are short staffed
