We had breakfast there today for about $25 each with tax and fees included but 2 of our party of 4 were covered by the bed and breakfast deal from JW Marriott and they didn't charge for the kid. Food was ok but plentiful and what makes it a 5-star for me is the ambience and the patio with the beautiful koi pond and cascades, refreshing in a summer morning. Staff was attentive amd we were there at 10 and breakfast ends at 11 but didn't fell pressured at all and nobody gave us looks for taking some fruit with us on our way out ;-)
