As others have noted, it's not a fair, it's a carnival.  I've always imagined State Fairs to be where people from the actual State get together and show off their produce, have pie contents, biggest pig, biggest tomato, talent contest, etc...  This is a bunch of private creepy carnival companies coming to town and milking you for everything you're worth.The games are stupid.  They're designed for you to lose, but so you don't feel bad, if you pay enough, most will guarantee a stuffed toy.  I'm sorry, if I want a guaranteed stuffed animal, I'll go to the store and pay market value for it.  Then they have their tricky ticket system, $5 get you 10 tickets, $20 gets you 40. So there's no benefit to buying bulk.  Each game is 7-10 tickets, and it's usually for only one try.  So you're literally paying $5 to try to throw a single ball into a random basket.  But you feel better because it's tickets instead of money, so you do it. The photo booths don't work, but they refuse to put "out of order" signs on them.  So we spent 20 minutes on a bunch of different booths that didn't work before getting our money back and leaving.  The food is probably the worst part.  Not only is it ridiculous prices, but it's also not food any more.  Fried burritos, fried burgers, fried ANYTHING.  There are places where you can't take a breath without getting a lung-full of fried.  The only good part was the Ferris wheel
