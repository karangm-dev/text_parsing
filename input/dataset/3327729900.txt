First thing, the food is amazing. Second thing, the wait is real. We came on a weekend. It opens at 11AM, but we got there at 9AM and there was already 5 people lining up. It was well worth the 2 hour wait for it to get opened though. By the time they opened, the line wrapped around the parking lot and it was mentioned by the owner that those in back could wait up to 4 hours before they are served. We got the fatty brisket, the beef short ribs, the pork ribs, and pecan pies. Everything was delicious.Fatty brisket:Incredibly juicy and flavorful. One of the best items they have. Beef short ribs:They serve it with the meat sitting proudly on top of the bone. It was tender and fall off the bone so easily. It was packed with so much flavor and juices. In personal opinion, this was better than the brisket.The pork ribs:They were delicious, but the other items outshines this one.The pecan pies:These were amazing to end the meal with. It hit the right spots. The filling was just the right sweetness and it had a light custard like texture. I regret not buying more to take back. Although it we waited for 2 hours, it was well worth the wait. The food was great and I want to visit again in the future.
