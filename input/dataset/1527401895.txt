I had to deal with john for 2 weeks..... unfortunately he didn't really seem to want to help,only make money. After giving us different quotes he finally took time to look at my car. I left my car after loosing my keys and they tell me it's going to be $500 to fix, then I call a week later to pick up to hear it hasn't even been started on.... After the weekend I call back and he said he made the decision on my bill of calling a lock smith that charged an additional $100 because that's what he though was best for my car! I just wanted to get out of there so he shows me to my car and I get in and it doesn't start!!!! Unbelievable! I walk back inside and tell him my car isn't starting and he makes a rude comment about how he had to leave his current work order to come see why my car isn't starting . I guess once paid they really want nothing to do with you. Of course immediately he starts coming up with reasons why this is my fault and not theirs, He also mentioned the locksmith they hired left all doors open when working on my car and he still then didn't think this was their mistake. I ended up having to get a new battery and auto zones told me someone had messed with the battery seeing it was   Backwards? $600 down the drain with terrible care to my car and customer service, my family and I will never return to this dealership.
