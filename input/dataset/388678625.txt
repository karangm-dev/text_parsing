I would not recommend Mary Ann! The first time she did my hair it was perfect! Second time - what was supposed to be a 11:00 am appointment turned out to be 4 pm since she did not write it down! Very disorganized. What should have been golden brown color turned out pitch black and the products used caused a lot of itching to the scalp! Disappointing experience overall!!!
