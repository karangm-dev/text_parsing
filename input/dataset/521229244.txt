Beware the breakfast scam. We're told the night before that "breakfast was 7-10 am." Upon showing up we discover however it's actually $12 a person. That part they left out, hmm. Nothing complimentary. I'm a light breakfast eater. Had I known, I simply would have been prepared and went to the store the night before. I brought this to the attention of the desk clerk Ryan, whose literal response was that "there's nothing I can do." So if you want a muffin for breakfast you can pay $12 for it here or you can go stay at Motel 6.  There's no free breakfast of any kind at this hotel.
