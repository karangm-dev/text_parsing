Eh. Idk why people come here so often, there are other places to get real bagels people! Im pretty sure everything here is frozen, if not it sure tastes like it is. This place doesn't need our money. Try going to a local business with authentic bagels instead of this rich low-quality chain that makes the same bagel here as it does in its NYC locations. I doubt any New Yorkers would waste their money on these wannabe bagels. Kind of lowers the standards for the American bagel, but if you like cheap quality food like McDonald's then this place is for you
