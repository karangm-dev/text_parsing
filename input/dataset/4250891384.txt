Went here the other day because I was hungry and saw it a few times since I've drove by it and never got to it. Now I wish I didn't go here. The food was not good. I order sesame chicken with white rice. It was not good and very bland. They serve their food on cheap plates and cups that look like it could be from a hospital. Food was not appealing at all. Once I walked in there was only one person there eating. That should have been a warning for me since the restaurant was kind of big but no costumers expect 1 person. I will never be returning here again unfortunately. The two stars is for the customer service. Very friend people and the restaurant seemed to be very clean. I will be looking for Chinese food else where.
