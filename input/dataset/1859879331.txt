Never have I had an skincare experience like I did with Jeena. I booked a microdermabrasion very last minute before traveling to freshen up. This is unlike any other treatment you'll receive at other places.If this your first visit, Jenna does a thorough skin analysis, from diet to daily routine, to get to the root of any skin problems you may have. Her approach is holistic, so she will give you natural solutions.The procedure began with cleansing of the face and assessment. From there she performs a VERY THOROUGH microdermabrasion, not leaving an inch of your face untouched. Afterwards she proceeds to steam the face and do any extractions you need, followed by (the best part) a very relaxing lymphatic massage of the face, neck and shoulders. The cherries on top that complete the treatment are a beautiful mask, which sits on your face for what seems like forever (you may fall asleep), then specific serums for your face and moisturizer.Afterwards, she discusses her recommendations for changes you should make for your skin. All of this is done in around 2hrs (if it's your first visit, just over an hour if not) in a very chic room that resembles a Parisian apartment. If you truly want a relaxing and beneficial experience for you and your skin, look no further!
