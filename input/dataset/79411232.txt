I have been to Vintage 95 twice, and both times were top notch.  I love the ambiance of this place, especially when it's nice enough weather to sit outside.  There's a decent variety of bruschetta, from traditional to brie with pear, pistachio, and I don't even remember what!  There's plenty in an order to split, and I've also split a burger or panini afterward.  The turkey panini was crazy good.  It was one of those times where I was stuffed, but could not stop eating.  Sweet potato fries and a nice glass of wine round the meal off perfectly!I'd recommend this restaurant for a date, lunch with the girls, or other small group.  I'll just go back to daydreaming about that panini...
