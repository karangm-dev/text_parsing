Great place to spend a few hours relaxing or doing work. The coffee is tasty but a little pricey. I haven't tried the food. I really like the ambiance - it seems like one of my friend's eclectic living rooms. Lots of strange animal art on the walls, and mismatched furniture. It's an all around relaxing setting, and there's plenty of space. It's a great neighborhood coffee shop!
