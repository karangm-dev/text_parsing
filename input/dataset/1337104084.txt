I've done this activity two times now.  The first was as a birthday present from my wife.  We had sone other friends in town who did it and it was fun.  It was difficult for me to really control my movement in the wind tunnel.  The second try was yesterday.  It was a little easier for me.  This is likely just a normal learning curve.  I had a nice in town and my daughters and wife joined me.  I had bought the 10 flights package after my first visit and also bought 10 more yesterday. I recommend doing that because they give a discount. The instructors are all very cool. They enjoy this activity and genuinely enjoy teaching others about it.  There's a lot of neat science in the aerodynamics and biomechanics. It's not as cheap as a nice at the movies but you can't beat this as a family fun activity.  You show up at the designated time but have 30 min after that time Fira video tutorial and then more time waiting but you can watch the groups in front and it's just a fun experience. I am planning to go back
