I've been coming to Family Doctors of Green Valley since I moved to town 9 years ago. All of their doctors are top notch and take the time to understand your situation. I have a few chronic conditions, so I'm not the norm, I've got medications and diagnostics to deal with at my appointments as well. About 10 months ago I started doing Medical Weight loss at another Doctor, and then found that their scheduling was so horrible that it would take me 2.5 hours to drive to the office, have my appointment and get back to work. That just wasn't working for me so I switched the medical weight loss over to my normal doctors office. There's a great continuity of care because I see the same PA for weight loss that I do for my Primary Care visits. So far I'm down 55lbs and I've never felt better. I even had to take a new DMV picture because my old one didn't look like me anymore!!I love that this office accommodates my schedule and they offer late appointments during the week AND weekend appointments too.
