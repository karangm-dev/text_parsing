I really really really wanted to like this place, especially since I love the Canter's in Los Angeles.  But, I just couldn't.   The matzo ball soup is slightly above dish water.  The soup is really week and they try to make it look like more than it is by adding a ton of cooked carrots to it.   Adding some actual chicken to the chicken broth would help.  Even adding chicken seasoning would help.  My wife and I ate their last week and the service was really lacking.  I know they recently opened, but after several weeks, I'd expect them to have their act together, especially for the high prices they charge.  So, the best I could possibly offer is a "meh."   For a real good Jewish deli, I'll go back to the Bagel Cafe, even though it's very much out of my way.  The food is worth it!
