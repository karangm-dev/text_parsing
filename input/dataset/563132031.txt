What a waste of a groupon. I still have half of it left and wont return. We went over summer. The staff just stood around, playing with the games and each other. No one to operate any of the rides, half the arcade games broken. The bathrooms filthy, hot, vents broken, stench. My God it was hot and smelly. This place has so much potential yet it is such a dump. Don"t bother, you will only dissapoint your kids. Luckily mine is young enough to not know better yet.
