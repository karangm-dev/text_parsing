I was in Vegas for work again.  This was my first time at this Wolfgang Puck inside the Aria building.  Its a little bistro that offers pizza and small plates.  The food was actually pretty good but the service sucked. We sat at the bar and the bartender was not friendly at all.  I would not return due to rude service.
