glare, you hurt me sosquinty squinty from the sunbut now no more glareLiving downtown and having a west wall of glass can be unbearable from the full blown sun baring down on you every freakin day. And it destroys your furniture, rugs, art, and anything else it beats down on.  What the hell did we do to the ozone layer that now the sun is our enemy.  I mean, hello solar power!  Use your force for good and not evil. In the mean time, Tint Pros is the way to go for blacking out your car windows, or your home windows.  Hell, have them do your sunglasses too.  (I kid...)  Flawless, clean work.  Very organized and knowledgeable people who will not steer you wrong.Carry on...
