I have had many good and bad dental experiences through the years since I am 73. I am so glad I decided to go get a second opinion from Dr. Ben Kim. I had been suffering with a toothache on and off and was given one diagnosis by a dental group that didn't seem right. Caring Dental Group took X-rays and Dr. Kim showed me the abscess and prescribed antibiotics before the extraction. The procedure itself was totally PAINFREE. I am not exaggerating. I was not even aware when the molar was removed. I am so happy I chose Dr. Ben Kim and I am recommending him to everyone I know
