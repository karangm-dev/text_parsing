This is cookie heaven. Most notable is their giant chocolate chip cookies which are miraculously always fresh and still warm from the oven no matter what time of day you stop in. Also noteworthy is the "nookie cookie", smaller in size, this bite-sized chocolate cookie is covered in icing sugar and is probably what people have in mind when they say woman prefer chocolate to sex...oh, also they make good sandwiches, soups and salads.
