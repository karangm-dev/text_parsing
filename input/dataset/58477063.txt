I was very pleased by the quick response time: they came out the same day I contacted them, and quickly found a short behind one of the switch plates. They came out again the next day to install a new box for my ceiling fan. I also like that they make payment very easy - can be done online with any credit card or PayPal.I found my go-to electrician!
