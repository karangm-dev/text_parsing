DO NOT GO HERE IF YOU VALUE YOUR VEHICLE!!! I went here this past Sunday to get my car washed. One of the vehicles in the wash came off the rollers causing a backup inside of the car wash. while trying to avoid the backup, I was struck by the vehicle behind me causing damage to my rear bumper. I've been calling the corporate office for over a week asking for insurance information, have yet to receive a call back. Now I'm stuck having to pay for repairs to my 3 week old vehicle. If i could give less than a 1 star review i would. please save yourself the aggravation and go elsewhere!!
