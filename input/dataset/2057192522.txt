Okay so I usually don't write reviews unless I'm irritated with customer service. I just called this location to ask if they would be able to do a grooming for my dog right now. The guy asked me what kind of dog I told him, I have a German Shepherd. He immediately stated I have to wait till tomorrow. He didn't say because they were busy or anything he just stated not till tomorrow. I'm not trying to be rude but this has happened on multiple occasions. I'm going to take my service elsewhere. All I wanted was my pup groomed.
