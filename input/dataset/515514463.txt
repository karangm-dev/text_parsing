I adore MadisonTap. Phenomenal courtyard, great concept of a rotating tap takeover, and really great people running the bar. I look forward to seeing what the new brewery will be each month, and having more time to dive into the food menu in future trips. But for now, for cold beer in a wonderful setting, MadisonTap is definitely my place to go!
