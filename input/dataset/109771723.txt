I got the foot reflexology for 45 mins. I didn't expect a whole lot, but for $50 I didn't expect her to be yelling at her staff the entire time. The pressure was no good. She actually started talking on the phone at one point. I only came here because my friend wanted to... My concerns were confirmed and I won't be back.
