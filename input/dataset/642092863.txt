I recently visited The Deuce Lounge at Aria and I did not have a pleasant experience with the bartender.  I stayed at Aria for the weekend and all the employees are nice and helpful; however, when I went into the Deuce Lounge, the bartender who helped was rude in his respect. We ordered our Carrot Cake martinis, and we wanted to each pay our own bill, so he gave us a number of 22 each, but the drink itself was suppose to be 18 dollars.  Some paid with credit card and some paid with cash. I gave him 25 cash, and I was waiting for my change.  At the same time, I looked at my friend's bill who used her credit card, there was an "automatic" gratuity charge of $3.00 dollars added to the bill!!!  I don't know there was this charge when we had a party of 3. Okay, maybe there is, so as I was waiting for my $3 dollar change, I did not get anything for 3 minutes, so I asked the bartender, and he was like, I am getting it..... And he came back right away, and tossed it on the table like he was pissed... I was unhappy with this service, because that was just wrong to try and keep the change when I did not voluntarily give it to him. In addition the added $3 gratuity!!! This was a very unpleasant visit in the Deuce Lounge and I expected a more laid back professional experience inside the Aria.
