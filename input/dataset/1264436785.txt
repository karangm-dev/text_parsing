this is by far the best buffet ive ever been to. we went on a friday night, the line was crazy long but they let us sit at the bar which was great!the staff at the bar was super friendly.and now onto the good stuff, the food! beef wellington, prime rib, elk, ostrich, creamed spinach and other yummy veggies and the desserts were killer! i ate enough creme brulee for 3 people. my only gripe, no tiramisu! but plently of other things to fill in that gap so they still score 5 stars with me!
