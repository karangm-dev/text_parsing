Service Advisor Dustin was very helpful and courteous helping get our first oil change for our 2014 Honda Civic as we were getting ready to drive to Colorado soon as this car had 5,700 miles on it as I could have gone the next day to Honda West where I purchased the car but wanted to get the oil change done already before my wife and I go on our trip to Denver. I think that we might have overpaid for the oil change with Pep Boys cause I got an email from Honda West for an oil change for $29.95 which I believe I was overcharged quite a bit even though I got $15.00 off using my Pep Boys Rewards card. I would very much like to have some money coming back to me. Thanks for your time
