Went to see Sharon.  She completely fried my hair and gave me  the most ugliest cut I have ever seen.  Like a idiot I went back there a second time because she called and said she messed it up.  I should of ran but I thought ok maybe she will fix it.  It is not anything thing like the picture I showed her and she did not know what she's doing when it comes to blondes  I had long hair now it is so short and she cut the sides so short and uneven.  My hair is green beige brown. This lady quoted me $80.00 and then charged me $120.00.  I should of never paid her but I was scared. They are grandma's cutters and colors.   Can't believe I allowed this to happen to me.  If I could give a  0, I would.  I think she was drunk.  Saw her drinking Wine.  Don't ever let a wino cut and color your hair.  While I was there I saw women leaving with the ugliest cuts and colors. That should of been a red flag.
