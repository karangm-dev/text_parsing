First time here and definitely won't be back. The bartender did not greet us, she just slapped menus in front of us and walked away. We were the only people at the bar at this point. We ordered our food and drinks and they arrived in a timely manor, but the food was not good. My husband ordered the green chili chicken plate and it was terrible. I had tacos, they weren't that great either.  It almost tasted like nobody gave a shit, if that makes sense. While we sat there a few other people came in to order food and we noticed that they never got silverware-one man had to get up himself to get it. We also heard the bartender complaining about working a double and also complaining about another coworker...I get it, but that is completely unprofessional especially when customers can hear and it does not excuse rude service. So not only was the food bad, but the whole experience in general left a bad taste in our mouths. I also have to add that I cannot believe a shot of casamigos is $15 (I had this with pineapple juice as a drink)...seriously...maybe if this was a nicer place, but come on. Just plain bad.
