The setting, decor, and ambience of this restaurant is southwest picture perfect, but that's only a small part of what makes El Chorro rate 5 stars. Our reservation for 4 was honored promptly and we were seated in a lovely corner table near a glowing fireplace. Once we settled in, our waiter Phil let us know specials of the day and took drink orders. He then brought us fresh cinnamon rolls hot from the oven -which were so good they easily could have been dessert. Upon looking at the menu we admit to thinking it was pretty boring. Wrong. The choices may have been somewhat traditional, but the presentation and taste were extraordinary. Shared salads - wedge and Caesar - were ample and had their own twists to preparation. Each couple coincidentally ordered the same entrees, trout and salmon. It was so beautiful that I wish I had taken a photo of my salmon dish. The fish was perfectly cooked and served with a ginger soy sauce on a bed of black quinoa and braised baby bok choy. The trout was served with green beans almandine and roasted potatoes. We also ordered a side of lobster mac and cheese for the table. All dishes were phenomenal. Then came dessert. We shared freshly baked apple pie a la mode and key lime pie, both fabulous.  However, as good as the meal was it was our waiter Phil who helped to take it over the top. Beyond his excellent and attentive service, he had the ability to let us leisurely enjoy our conversations, and know when to step in if we needed anything - and even absconding with the very last piece of key lime pie for us after being told it was sold out! It's no wonder this place has a deserved stellar reputation.
