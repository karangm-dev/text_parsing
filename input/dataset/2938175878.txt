Only place worth eating pizza if you are coming from NY/NJ.  I have been here on my last two trips to Charlotte and will keep coming back.  The ingredients are fresh and they even give you some local honey to dip the yummy crust into.We always get the large to get the true Neapolitan Crust.  What makes this place even more wonderful is we always see the owner working back there with the rest of his team.  This is a labor of love for him.
