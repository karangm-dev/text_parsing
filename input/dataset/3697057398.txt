GET THE HONEY TOAST!!! Excuses blunt excitement above but seriously get the honey toast...  I come to this place anytime I want a great place to chill with a great selection of drinks and it stays open until 3am.  This place has a fun Coffee Shop in an attic vibe.  The owner is amazing, she is always with a smile.  The coffee is delicious, never had a bad cup.  And once again GET THE HONEY TOAST!
