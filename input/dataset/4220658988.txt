This place is the worst customer service check out ever! It is  12:00pm Sunday and you only have two people ringing? Ok I'll give you maybe people call in sick. Me and 20 other people are in line waiting. Then your manager on duty is laughing and joking with another associate, as she gives her change. Noticing the line is getting longer you take your time laugh some more. With no one being helped nor being rung up. We are all still standing in line? Then after something is said both of you start to ring up again. With the manager still laughing. So sorry. I have been in retail for a long time totally unacceptable. I left my basket and the 300.00 worth of stuff I was going to buy there. The only good thing is the security officer, she welcomes you as you come in.
