The only time I visit the Cheesecake factory is for lunch. Normally this place gets very crowded and you have to wait for a table.I love the warm brown seed bread they serve with their meals. The lunch time portions are almost as large as the dinner portions but is quite filling.You do have to pay for parking but if you park in the garage they will validate you for $2.00 off your ticket.As far as the cheesecake goes, it's fair. I have had genuine NY cheesecake that lays on my stomach. This type is ok but not what I am used to.I normally will visit when family and friends want to go there but it isn't a place I would choose for myself.
