Chez Cora is the kind of place you go when you want quantity not quality.  They certainly give you large portions that will fill you up but the food is just average.  They have a pretty wide selection of dishes but none of them really stand out.  Usually I get La Recolte 90 which is a cinnamon brioche served up with bacon, an egg and a ton of fresh fruit.  I do enjoy the large portion of fruit but everything else seems just okay.  The bacon is never very crispy and the brioche is only so so.  I've also never been a fan of their pancakes.  They're never very fluffy and are on the bland side.  The same goes for their potatoes which could also do with some seasoning. The prices aren't very good either especially in Montreal where there are many other brunch places that serve up better food for lower prices.  Service is also sometimes on the slow side which can be frustrating.  Getting things like water and coffee refills can take time which is kind of annoying.
