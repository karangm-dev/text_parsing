The waitress was not friendly The food is ginormous portions .I was told I could not order a junior menu which was the only option on the menu with 1 egg and bacon The rude waitress said it was not her rule But because I was not a junior I was turned away .How crazy is that ? A restaurant denies you food because they do not have a smaller optionWould not recommend this service .
