DO NO GIVE THIS SERVICE DEPARTMENT YOUR BUSINESSI recently took my 2014 Honda Accord here for a simple recall on the battery terminal caps. Once I left the premises, the service department called me and tried to convince me that my battery was dead and I needed a new one. A new battery costs about $150. I have never had trouble starting my car so I told them to jump the car and leave it running because I was suspicious of the situation. When I picked up my car, I drove a half a mile up the road to Auto Zone and had them test my battery.  At Auto Zone, my battery ready full voltage and a 100% charge. No issue whatsoever!Moon Township Honda is CORRUPT!
