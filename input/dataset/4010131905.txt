I've been here twice to meet a friend for dinner.  It has an all-you-can-eat option, which is nice.  I'm always a little skeptical of Asian restaurants who don't have Asians working, especially when the sushi chef is not Japanese.  I'm also skeptical when there are no other Asian customers except for me.  Bad sign.  Fish is not very fresh.  Service is friendly and prompt, but not attentive (had to ask for napkins and missing sushi items)...except drink refills-my cup was almost always full without asking.To satisfy a sushi craving when you're in the area, it's not a terrible place to stop...but next time I will suggest a different place to meet my friend for our sushi fix!
