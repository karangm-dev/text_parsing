We were looking for a little coffee place, besides your usual Starbucks.  I came across Grinders Coffee thanks to Yelp, we decided to give it a shot.  No doubt it was a great choice, far better than Starbucks!  My iced coffee didn't have a bitter taste to it as it often does at other coffee places.  It had bold rich flavor that wasn't overwhelming.   We had no issues with service once so ever, the gentlemen was friendly and offered drink recommendations based upon our preferences.
