If I could give a negative star I would...doesn't even deserve one. Fianc√© and I eat at saddle ranch in California all the time and this location is a joke. We went out of our way while staying in AZ to come to dinner here. We ordered drinks, appetizers and an entree to share... as soon as I had finished my glass of wine there was a gunky residue that I couldn't even explain in my glass it was disgusting! The soup we ordered wasn't edible...when the entree came the manager happened to be the one bringing it out we told her  about the wine and soup and she offered a very insincere apology and acted shocked but the place was dead so I'm assuming this is the norm for them.... I was still charged $15.75 for my glass of wine....and left spending a total of $40 for 2 drinks and an appetizer...I did tip the server 20% because I am a server so I don't know if she had other issues going on but honestly the service from the server and food runner were pretty bad too...
