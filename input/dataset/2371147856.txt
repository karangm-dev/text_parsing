My husband and I go to Las Vegas a lot but had yet to visit the pinball Hall of Fame. We were so glad we took the time to go because we stayed around three hours and played as many games as we could. They had everything from new pinball machines to vintage machines. It was really a neat experience being able to see all the vintage machines. Games range from $.25-$.75.
