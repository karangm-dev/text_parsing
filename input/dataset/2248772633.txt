We had lunch here and the service was not so good and the food was whatever. Upon arrival, the hostess informed us there was a wait even though several tables were open because they were short staffed. We waited, and watched as they sat people who came in after us? We mentioned this and they said ooopps. We were then seated with a waiter who was too busy and not too bright. Service gets 2 stars. We ordered Sushi and the rolls were small with lots of rice to make them look big. The bill was $70 for two of us and not worth the price. I don't think I would try this place for sushi again. The other part of the menu looked alright though.
