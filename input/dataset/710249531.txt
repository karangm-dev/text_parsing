Best brunch ever? Best Brunch ever! And I can't say that lightly as we love brunch and have been to some of the top places in the top cities for brunch.Basically the deal here is you play a flat amount (like $40) and they serve unlimited small plates. Options range from Benedicts to Chilaquiles to Chicken and Waffles to Shrimp and Grits. I will be real in that I tried almost everything and loved everything I tried! The big standouts were the Chicken and Waffles, Steak and Eggs, and Chilaquiles. They also gave us a guava empanada which was not on the menu but was awesome! My pro tip: when ordering don't have everyone get the same thing. Mix and match and share! Otherwise you will fill up fast! Other pro tip: make a reservation. We got there at 11am which was a tad early for brunch there but by 1pm it was packed in there!
