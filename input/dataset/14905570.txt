Not sure why such high reviews.  Other than the friendly girl at the front counter this was pretty mediocre.  There was a kind-of dirty-plus-cleaning products odor to the place, there was a bussing tray sitting right next to the ordering counter the whole time.  The seats still had crumbs on them and the table some grease spots.  There's no ambiance and are no amenities - pizza delivered on a plastic tray, cheap plastic dishes for eating it, paper or styrofoam cups for the serve-yourself drinks.  This isn't an imaginative Italian restaurant with good food, table service,and nice tables and chairs.  It's a cheap pizza place with vinyl booths, windows with hand prints, and get-it-yourself silverware.The food - well, it was fine for the price, but there are tons of places that serve decent pizza these days.  Granted this was better pizza than, say, Domino's, but that doesn't say too much.  There was a decent amount of cheese, but it's not like the quality of ingredients particularly stood out.  Pale tasteless tomato chunks, for example.I didn't see that this Barro's, at least, had much to recommend it.
