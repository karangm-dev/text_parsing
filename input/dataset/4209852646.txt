Was yelping to find an italian grocery store and found this place, sorely disappointing!  The deli part may be good - don't know, didn't try it, but the grocery part sucks to be honest.  The choices are limited and it is outrageously expensive.  Seriously, $6.99 for a can of San Marzano tomatoes.    Won't go back there anytime soon.
