I usually stop by this restaurant every other week since it is so close to my house, however after dealing with the rude cashiers I won't be back. I've always paid with the same debit card and have never had problems however when I stopped by yesterday I noticed they charged my card twice. I came back and spoke with the younger lady and she told me it's normal it will go away in 24 hrs and there's nothing they can do since their manager isn't there, so she suggested I come back in the morning when the manager will be in the store. I come back a little after 24 hrs of my initial purchase and it still isn't fixed the manager still isn't there. The lady then told me it's usually 72 hrs that I'll see it go back. I found the way they handled my situation rude because then they started speaking in Spanish to each other. I know i can't be mad when people are speaking Spanish in a Mexican restaurant but my problem is they did so in front of me about my situation. I'm done dealing with this over charge of $33.50 and don't care to come back. There are plenty other delicious Mexican restaurants with BETTER customer service.
