Adorable pizza place in downtown Champaign with great pizzas, Italian drinks, beer, wine and of course gelatos!  We visited our daughter at U of I during Dad's weekend and went there for lunch. We were extremely impressed, its very cute and staff is super friendly. The pizza's are amazing and do have the Neapolitan taste as another reviewer wrote as they are thin, bubbly and delicious!  We had the lemon and orange Italian sodas and of course espresso and gelato's.  The owner came by later to chat with us and we asked him about the tips after reading reviews here and he informed us his employees are on living wages and therefore you can add the 10% tip or you do have the option to choose custom and add your own dollar amount (just an fyi to other readers).  We really loved this place and will definitely be visiting there again when we next take a trip to Champaign.
