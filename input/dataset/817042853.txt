This hotel was confusing and desperately in need of renovations. The air quality in the rooms and the hotel has major issues. This has been nought up previously by many guests staying here, but they have still yet to do anything about it. The food is extremely expensive, and has no taste at all. I got breakfast from the Starbucks nearby and dinner from around the area each night. The views are not the greatest, either they're blocked by construction or by a wall. Stay at a hotel more closer to the downtown core and stay away from here.
