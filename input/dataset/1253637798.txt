The food is as good as it's going to get at a fast food chain. Very basic, poorly put together with too much salt nor flavour. I use to like the apple pie, but not anymore. They put very little filling that when it cooks, it becomes this dehydrated hard lining in the pie shell with about two very tiny apple chips about 1-2cm. It's become disgusting. I have bought it a few times thinking it might have just been the batch, but on the 3rd round...their failure is pretty consistent.
