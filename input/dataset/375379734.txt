Loryann is amazing!  I have been going to her for eyebrow waxes, facials and chemical peels for the last 5 years.  She uses the best products {many of them organic}.  She is a perfectionist, which is a good thing when it comes to brows & faces!  Her personality is fun and puts you at ease.  I love going to see her, it is always an enjoyable experience which I leave looking and feeling better than when I walked in:)
