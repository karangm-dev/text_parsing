Do you I live here? Most likely! Enough that the employees know me by name and know my routine: Diet Coke, Popcorn, Shop.... Store is semi organized but they always seem to have everything I need in stock. The target cafe always has fresh popcorn and the Starbucks is better then the average target Starbucks.
