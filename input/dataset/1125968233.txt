I wish I could give zero stars; please do yourself a service and eat literally anything else, instead.  The only redeeming factors were the wine and the slightly more than acceptable fried banana.This restaurant is a celebration of complete mediocrity. If that.The salad bar was terrible and included actual rolled up cold cuts, warm imitation crab, and extremely wet "potato salad".  The sides included rice, beans, chicken soup, and a few other equally bland choices.Once the meat train began, we were treated to mostly tough, small servings of unseasoned steak, chicken, pork, and sausage.  They were all equally lacking in flavor and there was no break in between each item being brought to the table.  We ended up with a small, unappetizing meat pile that left us refusing additional pieces because of the unpalatable nature and absolute lack of desire.The dinner as a whole was uninspired and I wish I had spent my $155 on literally anything else.
