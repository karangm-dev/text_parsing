I have been fortune to spend around 20 weekends at the Venetian including the first weekend they opened. It has always been and still is a class hotel. It has worn well and looks as good it did that first weekend. The rooms are all suites and some are bigger then others but even in the smallest suite is larger then most hotels junior suite. You know this hotel got it's act together when there version of a coffee shop is the Grand Lux Cafe , which is a off shoot of The Cheesecake Factory. They have great restaurants and shows. The poker room is one of the best. See you soon old friend.
