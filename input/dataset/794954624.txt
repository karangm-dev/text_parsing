So I heard from some coworkers about this place and decided to try them, even though the line was super long. Coming from one of the most impatient people... It was worth the wait! I had a pizza with garlic and mushrooms and I believe onions as well. It was divine. There is nothing better than a wood fired pizza fresh from the oven. Under $10 and so many options. I have been craving more ever since. Only negative: having trouble finding out where they are, need more pizza!
