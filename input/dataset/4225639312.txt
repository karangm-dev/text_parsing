Having had the experience of working here for 3-4 yrs, I felt I had a relationship w / this company. Apparently, this new regime  requires people to " audition " ......I wonder : in a run-down facility such as North Mountain, did any of the have to , essentially , work for nothing ? In reading some of the other poor reviews, I have also seen residents abandoned to the hallway , with no caregivers in sight. The former Activity Director was very attentive and helpful, not to mention business-like. Sorry I can't say the same for the current administration... imagine how they treat residents .I refuse to work for a company like this !
