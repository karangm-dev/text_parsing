Great sub place that doesn't get old! I hadn't ate here in several years. Today, I happened to be in the area and figured I would stop in for lunch. To my surprise, the quality of the food hadn't changed. Still amazing subs and service. Small shop, nothing major, but they have perfected what they do. Highly recommended!
