Fazolis has really deteriorated in the last year. Went there yesterday. The store had no customers, but it took 20 minutes for our order. 4 staff members on duty. 5 tables dirty with no one showing any signs of going to clean them. Dining room looked completely unkempt. We won't be going back.Food was bad as well. I had the Ultimate Spaghetti. It was a dish of plain spaghetti with a glob of sauce with the meatballs all in the center. It looked like it had been out awhile and microwaved because the edges of the spaghetti were dry and hard. My husband had the lasagna and the edges of that were hard and dry and it was barely warm. The breadsticks were way under baked. There was nothing good about this dining experience.
