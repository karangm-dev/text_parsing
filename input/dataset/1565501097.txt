Maizie's used to be a weekly staple for me.  I'm a huge capicolla fan and Maizie's features the Salad Milano and the Chef Mike's Favorite Pizza that load up on it.  Their burgers were also on my nom list.  So you may ask, "why the low score?"I grabbed about $40 of take out from Maizie's the other day around 10pm (1 hour before close).  Included was the Chef Mike's Favorite Pizza.  It was bad beyond what any restaurant should in good conscious serve.  The entire top of the pizza was burnt.  It was covered in garlic (several layers thick) with pyramids of garlic in some spots.  There were sections piled up to a half a centimeter high in garlic.  I like garlic and all; but come on.  Not only was it disappointingly inedible.  It was so pungent it actually had to be removed from the house immediately and tainted all the other food.I was a Maizie's regular.  I'm a pretty quiet guy and keep to myself.  I tip well on take-out and dine-in (20%-25%).  I can't imagine that I might have offended someone who works here.  But this was bad beyond what I would consider to be just an accident.  There is just no way it ever could have gotten past even rudimentary quality control.  It was a single dining experience so noteworthy that it completely turned me off to this place.2 stars because it was good before it got so amazingly bad.
