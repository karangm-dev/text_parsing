Went at dinner time and decided to take our food home instead of dine in. Waited a good 20 minutes for that, if not longer, while the frazzled kitchen staff filled phone-in take-out orders. Had a gyro sandwich and a gyro salad. The gyro meat was dry and over salty; the cucumbers on the salad were watery as were the greens. Will not be back.
