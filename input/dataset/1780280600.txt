The most beloved rock group of all time.Cirque du Soleil brings us the spirit of the wonderful Beatles in this must see amazing performance. A beatles fan here so I might be bias but we all who have seen this show can agree.. It's a magnificent show, simply happiness.In the intro, the way the music starts is so moving that it makes you want to cry out of good emotions. Don't tell anybody but I kind of tear up a little during the show. I couldn't help it! That's how good it makes you feel. This show has all the right elements. One moment you're laughing, the next you're shedding a happy tear then before you know it you're moving your hands and feet to the rhymth of the music right in your seat.My girl kissed me out of nowhere during the song "something" and it felt awesome! It made my night even better. Well, If you're not a Beatles fan by the end you'll be showing the Beatles Love. Just go see it!We enjoyed every moment of it. Let's just say that it brings out your sensitive side with some of the songs you hear while they're being portray on stage. Don't know how else to describe it. You just gotta see it to know what I mean. Yeah it's that good
