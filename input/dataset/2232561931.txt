This used to be a very nice complex, clean grounds, friendly neighbors, two pools. It has all gone downhill after the complex was bought by a group of investors from Beverly hills. The security gate which made this place appealing is broken, had been for months. I have seen cars drive in casing the place for robbery. Beat up car, two suspicious looking characters driving in and then right back out. Questionable tenants moving in who I know are self employed sales people working out of their apartment. Management never returns calls, EVER. I would have recommended it in the past but not anymore.
