Love this place!! Not sure why sum picky people gave bad reviews but the burgers were amazing! I had a vegifi (best vegi burger I've ever had btw) and every1 else in our group had breakfast burgers (they loved them) and we all shared a basket of fries. The fries are the bomb!! Gr8 atmosphere in this place. There are multiple TV's w sports on and cool lighting! Oh, the shakes are amazing 2 but huge so u may wanna share!!
