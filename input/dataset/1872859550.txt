Nothing special here. It's about what you'd expect out of a Mongolian Barbecue style chain. Choose your base meat and carbohydrate (but not portions, that is set), add your choice of vegetables, then watch them roast it in front of you. I went with chicken and rice noodles, and a ginger garlic sauce. The finished product tasted like propane. The guys frying everything up work hard, but their efforts are about the best thing you can say about this place. I still like it better than Noodlecat, though, as it doesn't seem to take itself seriously. Many of the Kanji on the wall are backwards/upside down.
