Philadelphia Story playing in the background really set the tone for what would be a delightful dining experience. The seared scallops with saffron risotto were scrumptious. The apple upside down cake for dessert was the true star of the show. But beware, both mine and my friend's portions were petite. If you are starving, this may not be a great choice. If you want a simple,  elegant setting for your next date or social gathering,  I would definitely recommend. The service was perfection.
