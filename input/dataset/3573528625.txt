Long wait lines + $35/person = Quality & excellent food, right? NOPE. Its just your average buffet restaurant, no different from outside $15-20 buffet. Sushi is terrible!!! There is nothing to be hyped about. So, this will be our first and last visit on this buffet. Service runners = outstanding (thumbs up)The hotel is still gorgeous since they opened up back in the 90's.
