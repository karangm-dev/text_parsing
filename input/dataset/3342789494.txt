While visiting AZ for work I had the chance to meet up with one my oldest friends.  So glad I got to have dinner with her because otherwise the dinner would have been a bust.  When I'm in Arizona, I always assume I'm in luck with Mexican food.  With this visit to AZ, I think I had better Mexican style food at my hotel than here!  My friend boasted about how they have the same old lady making the tortillas from when the restaurant opened so many years ago.  That's cool, I guess.  The tortillas were ok, so were the tortilla chips.  The rest of the food was a big, fat meh.  I ordered the steak tacos --- the steak was over cooked and dry.  The dishes was very Americanized; the tacos were served with cabbage (?), is that normal?  My friends' dishes were swimming in cheese.  The guacamole appetizer was good, so I guess that earns a star.  Listen, I'm no mexican food aficionado...I live in Michigan for heaven-sakes.  But we do have a small, but good Mexicantown in Detroit.  I've tried the food there many a times, and sadly Olivos pales in comparison to the joints in Michigan.  Honestly, this wasn't my favorite place I went to on this visit to AZ.  Thankfully, the evening was saved because I was hanging out with a friend --- otherwise I think I may cried in to my guacamole with disappointment.
