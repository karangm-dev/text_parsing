Our friend took us here because he loooves it and always comes here on Vegas trips. We were expecting amazing, and it did not deliver. Maybe our expectations were too high or maybe we weren't wasted enough. Crowded at 4am, slow service, and food of Denny's quality. Not the diner experience i was expecting. won't be back.
