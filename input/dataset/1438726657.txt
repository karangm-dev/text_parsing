I recently moved to AZ and this was my first Saturday night coming to Hooters.  I came right after getting off of work to grab some wings and a beer before heading home for the evening.  I just wanted to say the staff was extremely friendly and fun.  I definitely enjoyed my visit and will be coming back.  Brandi, tending bar, was great to talk to; quick witted and funny.  Food was great, on time and delicious, even though when I walked in, there was a UFC fight going on and the place was packed.  Their ability to get food and drinks out with a full house was refreshing.  I was skeptical at first but they nailed it.  I would recommend this location to anyone.
