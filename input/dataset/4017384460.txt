OK kids.... brace yourselves! Real BBQ is here in The Grand Canyon State! Little Miss BBQ here is PHX!  Never fear,  I have already cried to the staff that we need one in Tucson! From the BBQ, that is advertised as available until sold out, that is tender and flavorful! Then there are the sides... jalapeno - cheddar grits (to die for) to the ranch beans that include "meat confetti" (yes,  that is what I'm calling it... all of the shredded BBQ beef end pieces) that are deeply flavored with spices that tickle the tongue! Pork,  Beef,  Turkey,  Sausage... and accoutrement! And the obligatory slice of oh so soft white bread! Man.... this was amazing and we will venture back... all the way from Tucson,  it is worth the drive!
