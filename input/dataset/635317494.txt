Sharks will try to rip you off.. Low inventory.. I shopped at Ashleys last year at the location on MLK and it was such a great experience. When i walked into THIS location everyone was friendly, greeted me and asked if I needed help....I found a bedroom set, the manager helped me and things went all downhill at the register!!......the manager discounted the bedroom set and added a $400 Extended Protection (EP) coverage. I advised him i did not want the EP coverage and he told me thats why he discounted the bedroom set so i could take the EP. He was not happy that i didnt want the Extended Protection & he even pulled the other manger to come talk to me, she said the EP was 'like a gift' they were giving me. After 10 minutes, they finally listened and removed the coverage and told me i would have to pay full price & he tried to up charge me on the delivery, (that was a 2nd argument). Be careful they will try to rip off. This location is smaller and has less inventory in comparison to the one at MLK.
