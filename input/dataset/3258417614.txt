If I could give a negative 4 star review, I would. Customer service DOES NOT EXIST, and I'm beginning to think that my car no longer exists either. Seriously, haven't seen my car since 12.20.2015. NO CLUE where its at. Horrible business. I don't understand how this company is allowed to operate. I am so stressed out and considering filing a claim.
