Purchased a Groupon and was assigned to Amy for a 90 minute therapeutic massage I believe it is Amy M. She didn't excellent job and I would highly recommend. I had the best neck massage and mild traction. My neck felt wonderful all day.  The spa is extremely clean and feels like going to the four seasons. Everything is nice and quiet peaceful tranquil. I do have to give a shout out to Amy for being so professional and stating that this was my time to relax and that she was going to be quiet now. It is so difficult when you go to massage places that the massage therapist is so chatty that you can't relax. I had a great massage.  My massage was 9 AM and I actually had just woke up went for massage felt like it fall back asleep again and then went home and took a nap for an hour and a half. I have not been sleeping well lately so this was such a treat to feel so relaxed that I was able to take a nap. Thank you
