The women running the business is a very scary-looking and rude woman. She doesn't even have nice teeth herself. The office wasn't very professional looking at all and my teeth didn't even look much whiter after the procedure (Maybe 4 shades?). Groupon holders beware there are way better ways of getting whiter teeth for $100
