Dr. Micheal and Kelly run a clean, professional and efficient practice. I've been going there for many years for routine cleanings and fillings. I finally succumbed to getting my wisdom teeth extracted, and Dr. Micheal made the experience as painless as possible. He was very quick and thorough, and I healed very well. Thanks for taking such good care of me all these years!
