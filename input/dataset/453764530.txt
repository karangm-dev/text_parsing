So that's why I don't go to Regal.So we decided to go to this theater for Fathers Day weekend to see the new Incredibles 2 movie and we only chose this theater because the showtime best fit our schedule and it was very convenient seeing as how it's right up the street from our house.Let's start with how dirty this place is. Popcorn and trash everywhere. And I mean everywhere. Outside, the lobby , the halls . You can't miss it. Our concession experience wasn't great and the main reason for my review. We were dealing with someone named Ashlee and then a rude gentlemen named Ryan decided to butt in and start arguing with us about the drink sizes and refills. When I tried to ask him a question he literally just walked away and decided to grab the customer behind me and start helping them instead. Probably the rudest customer service we have ever had. Especially when you are spending a small fortune on carnival food.The theater was hot and again dirty but it did its job. However we won't be returning .
