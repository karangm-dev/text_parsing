Just purchased a brand new E350, this is our first Mercedes vehicle. Walked in a dealership on a hot 110 degree out, staff greeted us with a cold bottled water and we walked around the showroom to see what's the best vehicle that's fit our budgets. Louis Gordon ( Internet sale ) came greeted us and ask what are we in the market for. So I explained to Louis, from that moment Louis made our transaction went smoothly from A-Z!!!! Louis is very professional, knowledgeable, explain to us all the ins and out... I would highly recommend all my friends and family that'll look for a Mercedes please come to Louis at Schumacher dealer.
