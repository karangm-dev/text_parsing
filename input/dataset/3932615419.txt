First impression:  very nice place.  Inside has good decor.  We were immediately greeted upon walking in, which was a good first impression.  Being our first time, we ordered a medium pizza, wings, and cheese bread -- we wanted to try it all.  The wait for the food was long -- 45 minutes sitting inside the restaurant is a little unacceptable for a pizza.  The manager or possible pen was not and kept reassuring us our food would be next.  However, several people who ordered long after us were eating before us.  That's frustrating when u are hungry.  I'll update in the food if we ever get any.  Food:  we got a specialty pizza...it was okay but nothing to write home about.  The chicken wings...small and mushy, wouldn't order again.  The cheese bread...doughy and hardly any cheese beside the center.  Also beware blue cheese dressing is water.  And the ranch says "refrigerate for quality" and its warm.  Who dropped that ball???  Both were gross!!  My opinion -- I won't come back:  we wait over a hour for pizza.  2 other tables asked for their money back and left with no food who were here longer than us.  The owner/ manager excuse was "we dropped the ball."  I get a new business and new adventures....but customer satisfaction  did not exist here.  Overall disappointme
