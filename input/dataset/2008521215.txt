Incredibly interesting menu items! Their pear bread they use for the grilled cheese it really good, and their salads are also well balanced and delicious. Generous portion sizes. Service was a bit slow, but I'm not knocking points because I think they were a bit short-staffed that night and because our waitress was incredibly accommodating: she even had a salad remade for me when I forgot to ask for some things left off. Really trendy and cute location, outdoor seating area is nice, shaded, and has misters.
