I've historically been a fan of DWR, but after a recent purchase through this location I do not plan to patronize them again. I ordered some items during the Knoll sale, and what began as a pleasant experience turned sour.Issues pertaining to shipping and communication: the account executive I worked with did not properly update my home address in the system after I had corrected it with her (I had to correct it with freight), I received a heads-up from DWR that white glove shipment would be scheduled AFTER the item already arrived (the freight company called the day before and I was luckily available at home during the delivery window with 24-hour notice), and I never received notice or tracking info of items that came through the mail.The worst part: I was overcharged over $800, and had to reach out to them about it. The account executive didn't even care to update me on the status of the refund until I reached out to her--again.I wrote to corporate about the matter two weeks ago, and still no reply. This is a testament to how much they care about their customers.Remember: the DWR studios are simply showrooms. They do not stock items, and customers still have to go through an ordering process. Knoll, Herman Miller, Vitra, and other fine manufacturers are available through many online retailers like Lumens and Yliving with free shipping, no tax, and world's better customer service. I've had seamless experiences with them, and would recommend going that route over ordering through the DWR studio any day.
