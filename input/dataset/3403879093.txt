Damnnnn...those wings. The key is to not be intimidated or shy when they arrive in front of you massive and lathered in bbq sauce. I could almost hear the wings heckling me 'Bawk Bawk!'. This is no time for pageantry or formality. I attacked the wings with reckless abandon.Smoky, juicy, crispy, tender. The smoke adds another dimension and you can taste it in each bite. I got a full order  - 6 monstrous pieces for $12. Great value, great taste and to top it off, a great selection of lager heads beer.
