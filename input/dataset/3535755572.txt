Gross... overpriced breakfast. $27 for two people! Nothing tasted very good. My omelette was super dry. My husband got a bonus egg shell in his salad. A manager was supposed to come talk to us about it... Never saw them. It was removed from the bill so it would have been over $30 for gross breakfast. It took a long time to get our good too.  Host was unfriendly. Waitress was sweet.
