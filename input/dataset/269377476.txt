It was Mother's Day but it wasn't that busy at 9:00 a.m.We were over run by a team of  young men when we got there but once we got our food they magically disappeared.  I asked for a little more cream cheese and asked 3 people before it came.  Also had to flag someone down to get a coffee refill.  Nice they gave us a coupon for a free entree on our next visit, which won't be anytime soon.
