Well, I'm not sure what is going on with this company.  We have always used them and found that their handymen were great and the prices fair.  But we were supposed to have someone over yesterday for a job.  We called the day before the job to confirm - no return call.  Called yesterday to see if we were still on the books - no return call.  Then I see the review posted by "the owner".  Not sure if the review is legit or not, but it does seem that there is some kind of drama going on with this company.  That is too bad, especially when they were my go-to handyman.  Looks like we need to find someone else.
