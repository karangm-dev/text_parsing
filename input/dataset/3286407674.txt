The Dowd Y is by far the best workout facility in the area for the money. From their class selection to workout equipment to friendly staff, you can't beat this gym. With a reasonable monthly fee that gives you access to all the YMCAs in Charlotte, this gym is the best bang for your buck. In terms of classes, the Total Strength and Roc-it Circuit Training are great if you like direction when doing any sort of strength training. The Pilates, Yoga, Cardio Dance and Cycle instructors are all quite helpful and make you feel comfortable whether you're a first-timer or partake in a class every day. Only class that gave me pause was Athletic Conditioning - instructor bellowing orders at me over loud speakers for 60 minutes just isn't my cup of tea - but it is apparently a great workout as people come out of it drenched in sweat. I've very rarely seen an "out-of-order" sign on any equipment, and with multiple floors (including weight and cardio equipment in the ladies locker room), you hardly ever have to wait for a machine. Staff is uber-helpful and always cheery no matter what time of the day. Fair warning: parking can be a bit difficult in the evenings, and is downright ridiculous in January with all the newcomers. So if you're trying to make one of the multiple group exercise classes, give yourself extra time to park to save yourself some stress. Overall great experience; I highly recommend this gym.
