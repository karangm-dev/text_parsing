I came here for a second opinion on what brake masters claim I needed done to my car which was over $600 worth of work which included new rotors and brake pads (front and rear). They ran some test after looking at the printout brake masters face me and did an inspection and guess what... Brake masters lied and I only needed $180 worth of work done which was new brake pads. I wish I knew that before I gave brake masters about $360 to start on the work. Network Automotive told me it was not needed and gave me a printout of other stuff I needed done which I already knew about because my family mechanic told me that before I moved here. They are trustworthy and I will definitely go back to them... Plus they are cheaper than the majority of the car repair shops in the Mesa, Gilbert, Tempe area.
