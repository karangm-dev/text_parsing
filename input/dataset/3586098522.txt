Really enjoy visiting this restaurant. It's nice to find a decent place to eat that isn't fast food late at night. Despite the fact that it's in the late evening, the food is fresh the pie is awesome. The tables and floors are clean which isn't always the case in restaurants that late at night. Wish I could remember the waitress's name she treated my wife and I wonderfully. We have never been disappointed with the skillets or other choices. We always recommend this restaurant. Enjoy!
