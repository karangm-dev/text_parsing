I saw the substitute for Mac King, Heath somebody.   I bought tickets at the half price booth and thought they were still overpriced after seeing the show and they were only $20.  One drink included with the ticket, but you wait in such long lines to get a drink from the 2 bartenders working that you will probably miss the beginning of the show.  Also, the maitre d' ripped some of the drink coupon tkts, so you wait in the long line and the bartender says you have to go back to box office and explain and get a new ticket. Watched it happen to 3 parties while I was in line, then it happened to me too.  Never seen such poor coordination.  I expected more from Harrah's.  The show was not of the quality I could find at any comedy club in the country.  Did I say employees who don't care?  Not worth it, even at half price.  I will say that the humor was appropriate for young kids though, if you are a family trying to find entertainment for the whole family.
