Denny's quality at Ruth's Chris prices. I will never go back, even if it was free. 2 stars only because I could (barely) finish the meal and the servers were o.k. The decor is hideous and hasn't been updated in years, presentation is non-existent, the food was low quality and completely lacked all flavor. I got Salmon and it was obviously microwaved (pretty rubbery). You'd be better going to Applebees, Denny's, IHOP, ext. and you will pay (literally) 1/5th the price for better food.
