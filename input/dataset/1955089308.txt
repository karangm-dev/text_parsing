This is the most aggravating company to deal with. Each customer service rep says that they're going to bust their but to help you, then they hang up on you or they pass you to someone else who promises to help you then they passed you to someone else who promises to help you, and so the story goes on. I finally get somebody to contact me and I wrote his email down. Apparently I didn't write it down correctly so I reached out for help, you know where that went. I told them it was an executive I told them what the name is I'm pretty sure ,they told me he doesn't exist. They of course told me they were doing everything they could to help me. I work at a job where we have to creatively figure out a different spelling for the name if we're close but not quite there I do it every day. I finally take that name and Google it and it turns out he's on LinkedIn. So then I send them the picture of the guy with his LinkedIn title for the job he has now with CenturyLink. My final reply is oh you know it's your fault because you spelled the name wrong. Thanks for your helpThey tell me they are not on my credit report and they wanted proof, you'll see the picture attached. I was told by I believe 9 or 10 Representatives that it doesn't exist. This company does believe in good customer service.
