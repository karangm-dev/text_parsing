Terrible theatre. Parking lot, ticket area and especially concession stations are a total mess. Theatre smells hot and dirty when you walk in the door. Concessions having the slowest, most poorly trained people I've ever dealt with. I will not be back--this place is a total joke with typically lousy Arizona style service. Go to Draft house in Chandler, great service, real seating and concessions to your seat--for about the same ticket price. This location is doomed.
