So revealing my age here, but last went to this buffet BEFORE Yelp was invented! But I definitely need to add this buffet to my reviews...its as good as I remembered in that analog era. Omelet bar, pastries, American breakfast items, local style food, and brunch items. Asian, southern, and mexican food. Cannot go wrong. Mimosas too! $12.99, $1.00 off if you have players club.
