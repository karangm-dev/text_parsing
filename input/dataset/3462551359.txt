Stone Creek earned their 5 star review.  I had a custom built-in home office made, and it is beautiful.  It looks just like the pictures.We did run into a few hiccups along the way with the installation process.  They were running behind schedule (hiccup 1), but that wasn't too big of an issue.  We did run into another bigger issue where there was a serious miscommuniction to me from the company on some important measurements, but this is where Stone Creek really impressed me.  Once I called the company and explained what happened, they had someone come out in just a few days and fixed all the issues with no additional cost to me.Now we have exactly what we wanted, and it fits our space beautifully and looks amazing.  All for about the same price as getting some office furniture from a store like Pottery Barn, but totally customized and way more functional.
