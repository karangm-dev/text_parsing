My experience mirrors Sheryl T's who posted 1/2015. Over the past 4 years I have purchased 6 different mattress and box spring sets for family. I have always found the mattress shopping experience extremely frustrating. How are you supposed to make such an important decision from laying on a bed in a store? Mattresses aren't cheap so making the right decision is tough. This last time, I met Denise and finally found a professional who could help me to make the best decision for a mattress I purchased for myself. I have a bad back and so the process is extra difficult. Denise was concerned with my needs and patient while I spent time lying on all of the mattresses. She was extremely knowledgeable about all of the available products and spent time educating me so I could make the best decision. When was the last time you met a salesperson like that? Mattress Firm should use her to train all of their sales people!
