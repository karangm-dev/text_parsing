I'm late with my review from 12-20-15 vs the Denver Broncos. I have been to Steelers games here many times and every time, I have a great time, win or lose. On the aforementioned game day, the experience was typical at Heinz Field: Great food at the stands, helpful staff everywhere, reasonable safety policies, a safe environment, easy pedestrian ingress and egress, the best fans anywhere on the planet and a spectacular game! I have come to call Pittsburgh my second home. I feel like I'm family even when I go to Heinz Field alone and my fellow Steelers fans treat me like we're old friends. They also are very respectful to opposition fans. The experience is well-worth the eight hour drive from Connecticut. I can't wait to get my season tickets and I can't wait to return! This is a top-notch sports venue that gives a top-notch experience! -Bryan D. Kearney  Cheshire, CT
