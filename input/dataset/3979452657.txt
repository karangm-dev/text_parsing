I've been to a few Buffalo Wild Wings in the past, mainly in Tampa where I live.  Most of my experiences at this chain have been average.  I went to this location after a work function while I was in Cleveland as the locals wanted to gather here for some reason.  Thinking it was the middle of the week with not much going on, I figured it would be a run of the mill outing.  They had good drink specials I suppose, but the service was lacking.  It took almost 10 minutes after my arrival to even be approached by a team of servers that was tending to our table of 10-15.  Once I placed my order it took another 10-15 minutes to receive my Diet Coke and Water.  Not sure what the hold up may have been.  I suppose they may have been waiting for enough snow to melt to fill up my water glass.  Anyhow, once our orders were placed there was mass confusion.  None of the orders came out together.  People got wrong items or items were missing all together.  I guess having 3-4 people waiting on a table of 10-15 is just not enough???  The one thing that made the experience enjoyable at least was that they had on screen trivia going so it helped pass the time.  I guess this may have been a way restaurant management thought to entertain customers who have to wait for slow service.
