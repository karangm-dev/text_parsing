Unfortunately, I have to agree with the other negative review that's posted here... I'm a long-time Marriott customer, but sadly, this is a hotel that I'll be avoiding in the future. Before the specifics of my most recent experience with these folks, I'd have to say that the main problem with this hotel seems to be that its management simply lacks the commitment to Marriott's usual high-standard for quality and service. The current manager, Steven Steinhauer, personifies ineptness/incompetence, and he conveys a curious lack of interest/concern in the quality of service provided by the hotel. Now to the specifics of my 3-day stay last week... I'm a Marriott Rewards member... always, I'm given some kind of welcome token... nothing too exciting -- bottle of water, cookie, apple, whatever... always, though, there' s some kind of coupon for the bistro. Zippo on all counts... Then to the room... on the ground floor... strange smell in the room -- not quite "moldy", but not nice smelling either... OK, I'm busy and need to head out for a meeting so I just "deal with it" for now... Get up early the next morning, and I leave some toiletries with the free shampoo/conditioner... I come back late in the evening and find that my toiletries have been "thrown away" (I'm assuming they weren't actually stolen by the cleaning staff -- goodness, who would steal toiletries?!). At this point, I am now losing patience with my Marriott "experience". All of this was conveyed to the hotel's management -- not once, but TWICE. They could have cared less. How disappointing... Inept management is to blame -- Marriott's otherwise good reputation besmirched by an incompetent fool who will, no dout, be fired soon enough.
