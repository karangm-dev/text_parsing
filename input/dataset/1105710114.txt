Wow, I have never seen so many negative reviews, here is a different spin on On Trac.  We ordered from 3 day blinds and got a call from On Trac saying they could not find the address, evedently Three Day put the wrong address on the package, the driver was 1.5 blocks away.  He called my wife and said Three day would have to call them and change the address tonight to get it delivered tomorrow.  So I am wondering why they could not drive 1.5 blocks and check an ID to make sure we were the right people.  I called On Trac and they said Three Day would have to call them, I asked why they could not drive 1.5 blocks, and they actually said there is a back charge to change the address and Three Day would have to pay it before they would deliver our package, I told them what I thought about that, UPS or Fed-x would have just come over and delivered the package if they were 1.5 blocks away.  The lady on the phone was not nice at all she just gave me attitude and said it was policy.  Their policy will put them out of business, and I hope it does, so since three Day Blinds are closed for the evening it will be two or more days until we see the package.  Do Not Use Them, They not only do not serve their customers, but do not care about the recipients either.  They just want to profit from someones mistake rather than solve a problem easily.
