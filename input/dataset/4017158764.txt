I recently went to this location because it was recommended to me from another uhaul store..  Very rarely does someone impress you as much as Mike Johns did while doing some installation lighting work on my car.  I recommend him highly to anyone wanting quality work done on their vehicle.  He was professional, helpful and knowledgeable.
