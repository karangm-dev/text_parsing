Never again!   My wife talked me into trying it while we were getting the oil changed and the truck washed across the street.  I told her that I had a bad feeling about it before we walked in.  So, in we walked and sat in a booth.  I started for the buffet and grabbed a plate.  The under side of the plate was not clean.  It had a gritty feeling like it was not totally clean but I tried to put that aside and just keep a open mind.  The buffet was lacking in a lot of ways.  I was not impressed but did not say anything to my wife.  She went to the buffet and returned with a plate full of food.  I took a bite of the Broccoli and Beef and it had a "different taste" but I didnt say anythng.   I decided right then that I would not be returning for anymore food and that I really wanted to go somewhere else for lunch.  My wife told me a few minutes later that she was sorry for making go here for lunch.  The food was horrible!!!!!  It was a really bad experience.  I returned to the office and made a frozen dinner to eat which was MUCH BETTER than lunch at the Bamboo Buffet.   Yuck!!!  I will never return again!!!
