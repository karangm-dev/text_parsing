DISGUSTING - If by saying "you get what you pay for" you mean that you get broken elevators, bathroom sinks that don't drain, a smell that is only slightly less off putting than steer manure, and carpet that is so filthy you should wear socks even to bed, then YES you get what you pay for.  At first we were impressed with the overwhelming number of security guards around the hotel and biking through the parking garage - but after reading the reviews about the hotel safety that now makes sense.  I certainly didn't fear for my personal safety BUT health...that is a whole 'nother story.  I was completely prepared to throw away all our clothing expecting bed bugs, I am happy to say they got one star because they did not have bed bugs.  If you make the mistake of booking this place expect very little and be prepare to be disappointed.
