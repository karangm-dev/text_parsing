Been a here a few times with my son he usually gets a good cut, the last two times not so well sloppy lines and uneven cuts the barber was pressing super hard with the clippers on his neck it looks like he got into a fight and someone scratch up his neck.. Referred a friend here to get her sides shaved down the original guy who did the cut was great when she went back in for a clean up idk if the guy was drunk or what but totally messed up he line up completely uneven and missed huge chunks of hair.. unfortunately they lost a loyal customer to inconsistent service smh.
