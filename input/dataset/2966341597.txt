My husband purchased my engagement ring at Dapel after much searching.  We also purchased both weddings bands there as well as had a few other modifications made on jewelry.   The customer service at Dapel is remarkable.  You really don't find anything like it, almost a thing of the past.  I enjoy each visit I make regardless of if I purchase a new item or not.  Paul really wants you to find something you love and does not pressure you to simply make a purchase. He is great, values his customers and treats them like loved ones.  Best jewelry store in Pittsburgh!
