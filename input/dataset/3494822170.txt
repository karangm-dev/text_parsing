U should call this place Robertos. and that would be an insult to mr. roberto himself. i had the fish tacos of course and wow were they plain. just think of middle school lunch fish in a bland torilla. flavorless. u would think with a name "wahoo's fish tacos" their tacos would be good. this is really a bar. the bar is good and it has gaming so go here to drink and gamble not eat.
