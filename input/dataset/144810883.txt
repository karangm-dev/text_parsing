Just tried this place out Saturday. Totally fabulous!! I didn't have an appointment but needed my underarms waxed. The receptionist informed me that my wax would be free since I was a first time customer. Heather was my wax specialist and she was AWESOME!! She explained the entire process to me and I barely felt any pain. Wish I had tried this place sooner!
