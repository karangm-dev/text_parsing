I went in for a hair appointment not really knowing what to except, I have seen all the pics from their Instagram page and was confident I made the right choice to get my hair done here. I have previous gone to a different salon which always did a good job on my hair but due to the colour I wanted this time I wanted to try a salon I knew would get the job done. When I walked into the salon I was greeted by Lisa who is such a doll, she took my jacket for me and gave me a robe to protect my clothes. I had booked an appointment with Yorsiny who happens to be amazing at her job and goes above and beyond to make her clients happy. Upon starting the session I advance I wanted to go with a grey/silver tone but due the fact that my hair originally is black it may not be attainable because I would need to be super blonde. She advised me it may not be possible which I understood and just stated would like to go lighter either way. 5 hours in the chair and with help with Rian my hair turned out better then what I excepted, I was able to get the grey tone that I wanted and I am super in love with my hair colour now. Not only were the women working there amazing but the atmosphere and the environment of the salon is just very inviting, I will def be coming back in the future to have all my hair need meet from the beautiful and talented women from this salon.
