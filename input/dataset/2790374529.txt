I've been going to Chatterbox for years and there's a reason why I keep coming back - value! I'm shocked when I hear my friends and coworkers talk about the $hundreds $ they spend on their hair! I get a cut and color for less than $100 including tip! And my stylist is great, talks great about her coworkers, and enjoys her job. Check out Chatterbox!
