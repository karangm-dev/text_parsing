I've always heard of planned parenthood & told that this is the place to go to for important female needs. Today, the first time ever going ended up being the worst service I've ever dealt with for a medical office. The girls at the desk are rude, and not helpful. It felt like as if they don't want to help you. You ask a question and it's a vibe of "why are you bothering me?" They accept walk ins but don't even have someone there to take an ultrasound? Why would you offer any and all services but can't have them available an hour after opening?After an hour of calling around different offices to take my pregnant cousin too we finally got helped in the hands of someone else. Not planned parenthood. As I was outside calling different numbers, multiple people left because they would not help them as well with their needs.Us women deserve to feel welcomed and get knowledge on certain topics especially when it comes to our bodies. How are we suppose to PLAN out a new life of PARENTING but can't even get any information? No good luck, no offering of an appointment for another time with a doctor, no information what they can offer. Instead you get a "here's a brochure from the wall. Call these list of numbers. They'll help you, not us." Very VERY disappointing.
