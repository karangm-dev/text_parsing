I have only ordered delivery from Pizza Pan.  I haven't visited the physical location, so I can't comment on accessibility, cleanliness, etc..It's your typical, inexpensive pizza delivery place.  I felt like the price was too good to be true, and I was right.  The cheese used on the pizza is obviously a low grade mozzarella.  It left the pizza pooling with grease, especially in the center.  I've also ordered wings from there.  They were obviously previously frozen and lacked any real flavour.  They were also quite chewy and lasted a little freezer burnt.With so many delivery options in Toronto, it's hard to imagine that I'll be ordering from Pizza Pan again.
