Honestly the best hamburgers in town! The sweet potato French fries are excellent! It's awesome to be able to see them cooking your fresh made to order food! There's always fresh variety of toppings to choose from and you can put on whatever you want! Soft drinks have unlimited refills with a great selection. If you have room for the desert, I recommend the brownie!! The music is always such an awesome selection! The people who work here are so happy and friendly, something that should be a staple in every restaurant.
