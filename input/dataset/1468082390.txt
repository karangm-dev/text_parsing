My sushi was not able to be eaten with chopsticks! I ended up eating them with my hands on a side walk because it was falling apart so badly. It was my first time going and I don't think that I'd try it again. They also do not have Vegas rolls, they charged me for the few orange eggs on top, I forgot the place I normally go to has cream cheese in theirs.  The flavor was ok, but again, likely not going back due to the poor construction of it.
