I'm not sure if I came in at a bad time... I came in for lunch with my friend and it was certainly busy. When we were seated our waitress was very friendly at first. She was very attentive (which she should be considering how expensive this restaurant is). I ordered the Fettuccine Alfredo and when it came out it looked delicious. It tasted absolutely HORRIBLE... It was loaded down with garlic and it ended up making me throw-up sick. I called the manager over and he didn't offer to take it off the check or anything. I told him to just bring me a burger to go. The waitress came back out about 30 minutes later with the burger and it wasn't in a to-go box. I had to ask her to bring me a box for it and she had an attitude. I said thank you and was continuously polite throughout my visit and she never said "you're welcome" or anything very polite back. Whenever I said "thank you" she just turned away. She wasn't horribly rude, but I definitely expect more for such an expensive restaurant. After we left, about 30 minutes later I had to go to the bathroom and throw up. I won' be coming back... This restaurant is not at all what it is talked up to be!!
