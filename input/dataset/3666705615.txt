I just moved to Charlotte about a year ago and I have been dying to eat at JJ's! I finally did this past weekend and boy, was I impressed! First of all, for a hot dog joint you would think it would be a hole in the wall or a cart on the side of the road. JJ's had a retro, old but fun feeling inside. It was super clean and very welcoming! They even have a rooftop seating area for when its nice out, which is almost all the time in Charlotte! I got the Char-Heel combo (House-made Chili, Slaw, Diced Onions, Yellow Mustard on the hot dog, fries and a soda). At first, I was skeptical of having all those crazy ingredients on a hot dog, I'm a plain hot dog and ketchup person but it was the most delicious combination on a hot dog I have ever had! Side note - If you are from New York and you know anything about garbage plates, get this hot dog! It tastes exactly like a garbage plate!!! And on top of how delicious this all was, it's only 7 dollars! The employees were all very kind. The woman at the register helped me to pick out which hot dog I wanted, she was very patient when we asked questions and very helpful. The boy who delivered our meals was funny and willing to do what it took to make us happy customers. FYI - Thursday's are 6 dollar all you can eat hot dog bar! I will most definitely be going back for this sometime soon! Definitely check JJ's out, its worth it! I know I'll be back soon!
