Added this on my bookmarks for our quick trip in Arizona and made sure to have this as our first stop once we landed. We arrived about an hour before they closed so we were limited on selections. They don't reheat and only make enough for they day and only use top quality meats so I recommend going in early if your in town! They only had chopped brisket left when we got there and it was AMAZING! Im sure the other bbq they make is even better and thats why they sell out I definitely can't wait to try this again next time. The people that work here are so nice and put out a welcoming vibe. The pecan pie was to die for I've been craving it since!
