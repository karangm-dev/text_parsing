I work in the Scottsdale quarter as a hairstylist at Drybar. Working in the beauty industry in front of a mirror being someone that has always struggled with acne I can say that for the first time ever I have the confidence to not wear makeup in public. Skin laundry has revolutionized the way we can treat our skin in under 10 minutes!! There is no downtime and I don't have to hide under any huge sunglasses. I am so grateful there is finally something effective that isn't painful and doesn't have to involve any toxic medications or burning topical products. They use a laser and a light treatment in addition to an awesome skin care line that helps balance my PH. My friends and clients have noticed a difference not only in the way I look but the way I feel!
