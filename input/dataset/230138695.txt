Since trying Line Thai for the first time and my first review of the restaurant, we have returned for lunch numerous times and dinner several times.  With each visit we find the food excellent.We love the fresh Spring Rolls they create here and often will order them to take out at lunch time so that we can have them for fun Asian lunches we prepare at home.  The rolls really make our at home meals extra special. Had the sweet and sour pork dish today along with the sizzling half chicken, so very good!  We'd come here more often if my husband wasn't on such a low sodium diet as the food here is terrific.
