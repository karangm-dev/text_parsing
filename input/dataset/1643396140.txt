We visited Petinos during the long-weekend for the first time. From our research, we only found 3 locations of the brunch spot and chose to visit the Laval branch due to the great reviews. It was there that we discovered that they recently opened in the South Shore but ah well, it was worth the drive!We arrived around 12ish which is usually when the crowds are clearing at breakfast places but there was still quite a line up. It was a Saturday and long weekend, so it was expected I guess. We waited approximately 15-20minutes and were given a super warm welcome by the lady taking the names... It was a pleasure to meet her, she was friendly and full of life! Despite being very busy, they really have excellent service and attention. For the service alone, I would definitely return. Our waiter understood our special meal requests without us even having to explain and immediately knew how to amend our orders to suit us! Very impressive!My husband and I both ordered from the Monteregie section (it was super difficult to nail it down to one selection as the menu is never ending! We both wanted eggs, potatoes and waffles so it was the perfect combination for us! Every single thing on the plate was mouth-watering and delicious. I would happily go back just to devour a whole plate of home-style potatoes - they were perfect! I found it difficult to finish my plate as even half a waffle is huge - I had the waffle with oreos and Nutella! I was in heaven  This kept me full all day!Overall, extremely impressed by the quality of the food, the impeccable service and hospitality and the coffee/tea refills throughout! They really know how to spoil their clients. Petinos has easily become my favourite breakfast/brunch spot and I cannot wait to try the South-Shore branch to see if it does Laval justice
