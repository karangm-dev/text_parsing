Eh. If you can't eat meat or cheese don't bother. Only 1 vegetarian option on the menu. When I asked the waiter if there were any other options or if there was anything meat could be taken off of (restaraunts do accommodate like that often, ya know) he said the Greek salad was vegetarian. Greek salad has sardine dressing. It's not vegetarian! I just wish there was a little more variety on the menu. It's very much a cheesy, meaty, greasy mess. If you're lactose intolerant I wouldn't suggest either. They lost a whole table because I couldn't eat anything on the menu. Overall very disappointed....And I love Guy!
