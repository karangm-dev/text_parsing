absolutely disgusting. arrived for lunch on a Sunday. not only were they not prepared, the food they did have available was lukewarm and disgusting. warm drinks... this is by far the worst sushi I have ever seen in my life. I managed to stomach one plate of stale, cold chicken and they had the absolute nerve to charge me about $15! I would rather eat a pile of dog dook than eat here again, it would certainly be a healthier, safer alternative.
