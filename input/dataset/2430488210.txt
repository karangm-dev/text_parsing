Best pizza in town! Since a few of our other favorite pizza places closed, this is now our favorite go-to pizza joint. Even though its on the strip, its not that expensive and the pizza is just so incredibly tasty! Also their salads are great - a small portion is still enough to share between two. Wish their were more branches of this place in town.
