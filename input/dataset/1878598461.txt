Food is great. I wish they'd throw in some rice and beans to fill out the meal. I always get the green chile chicken enchiladas with habenero on top. They are quite delicious. There are also good vegetarian options available. I also wish there was a good enchilada and soup combo meal.  It's more of a pick one entree either or kinda thing. I mean the name is enchiladas AND soup, not OR.  Also, the sneeze guard is awkwardly placed making it very difficult to hear the employees.I guess I feel a little overly critical especially in light of the o so many positive reviews but  guess I can't help how I feel. One more thing.TIP: make sure you get the sour cream on the side unless you want a big white pool of melted liquid sour cream engulfing your enchilada. The enchiladas are cooked in their plate leaving the plates very hot and they instantly transform a hearty clump of sour cream into liquid.Update 7/29/2014: Seems as though they've worked out the kinks. There is still quite a bit of a lunch rush so If you are pressed for time it might not be the best place to go but otherwise it's worth the wait.
