Went in for dinner with my girfriend under their new management. Ordered soft shell crab roll, spicy tuna roll, beef short ribs, and chirashi dinner. The quality is somehow changed, taste is good but when the menu said soft shell crab roll comes in 8 pieces then I expect 8 not 5, told waiter and he went back checking on menu then came back and said 'Yes, it said 8 but it's 5'. Chirashi dinner is also lack of quality, I used to love to order it here a lot before since it was the best I've had in Phoenix but now they ruin it by taking ikura, ika, and unagi out of the bowl. Beef short ribs ($16.95) were over cooked covered in oil and very chewy. Overall disappointed.
