So it was Saturday night and my girlfriend wanted to try eating somewhere new.  We have our favorites, but sometimes get bored.  We ventured out to 'Restaurant Road' and came across Johnny Fox's Public House.  Very nice atmosphere, cool furniture and tall ceilings.  It has a very inviting vibe (if that makes sense).  For an appetizer we had potato cakes which oddly had egg on top.  It was good.For an entree, I had the Corn Beef sandwich and my girlfriend had the St. Patricks Day traditional Corn Beef, Cabbage and potatoes w/ carrots. Dessert was upside-down apple cake w/ toffee sauce and candied pecans.  A little too sweet for me, but very good.We both enjoyed our meals and had lots of left-overs.  The corn beef was extremely tender and lean.  Never seen corn beef so lean before.Service was great.  I drink a lot of water and the waiter was kind enough to come often to refill my glass.We are glad that we found Johnny's and will definitely be going back to try new dishes.
