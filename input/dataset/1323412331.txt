After having Safe lite come out twice with the WRONG windshield Geico gave me this companies phone number. Within a matter of minutes Cynthia knew just what type of windshield I needed (she was the only one to ask for vin). Appt set for next day 11-3. Tech showed up early (after calling 1st)before 11am with the CORRECT windshield even the correct shading. Job completed. Owner more than satisfied with their employees knowledge and service.
