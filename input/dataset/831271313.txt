I've eaten here several times and is one of my favourite restaurants.  The food is delicious and they serve generous portions.  My favourites are the ceasar salad and the linguine with goat cheese and mushrooms. The servers are fast, polite and attentive and the owner is very personable.  He is always present and gives everyone personal attention.  The place is small and you may have to wait a few minutes for a table but it's worth the wait.
