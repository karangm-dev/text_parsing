Went here a couple months ago and forgot to write my review! I ordered the al pastor which they gave me a sample of first ( omg soooo good!)They also have my favorite thing ever here.A SALSA bar! All the tacos I had were amazing. The staff was incredibly helpful ( and deserved a good tip )If this place wasn't so far from me I'd be back every week! Open more locations just like this one on the southwest side of town please! :)
