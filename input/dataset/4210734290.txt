Dr. Chow and her staff are very professional, knowledgeable and patient oriented. They take their time explaining everything and listen carefully to your concerns and questions. During my last visit I learned quite a bit about my eyes and found answers to questions I have had my entire life. Patient education seems very important to Dr. Chow. The eye examinations are varied, technical and extremely thorough. I have several nearby choices for my eye care but I choose to drive 14 miles across the valley to see Dr. Chow and her great team. You will find a large selection of frames to choose from if you have your glasses made at Dynamic Eye Care. You are in good hands when you trust Dr. Chow for your vision care.
