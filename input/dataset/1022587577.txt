This is the perfect place for a quick breakfast that's good for you. They offer a variety of juices, smoothies and bowls. I went with the Toxin Flush juice, so good! They even have promotions through their app that reward you the more you show up! Definitely worth stopping by to try out. Wish we had more of these places in Los Angeles!
