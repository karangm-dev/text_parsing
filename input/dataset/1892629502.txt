This was literally the worst meal I have eaten since I ate at my junior high school cafeteria. The flavors were lacking, the service was horrible. I ordered a chicken burrito and it came with nothing but shredded chicken and a tortilla. It was not flavorful. The staff didn't know what the food options were when asked. Also, I asked the waitress what was included in the chicken burrito and she said she would ask, she brought me the food without ever asking what was in it. Poor food. Poor experience. Save your money. Save the time. Save the calories. Yuck!!!
