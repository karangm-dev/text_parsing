Just wanted to write and say, THANK YOU!!!You and your mechanics, once again have demonstrated EXCELLENT workmanship on my vehicle.First time you completed the front brake work on my vehicle (I ordered the parts, trying save $$$). I developed a loud brake squeal. After inspecting, you recommended that I use OEM brake pads. You ordered and installed the pads. You even worked with me on the cost (which was my error to begin with).Everything is working PERFECTLY!!! Thanks Again!Reggie Graham
