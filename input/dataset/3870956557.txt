Rancho Flooring installed a tile shower in my house. They guaranteed me the shower (on the second floor in my house) would never leak. Over time the mud around the shower drain  cracked (installed by their contracted plumber) and my shower was unusable for over eight months before Rancho Flooring agreed to reimburse me for their mistake.
