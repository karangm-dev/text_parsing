first off, gotta love the fake one star review below... Heritage isn't open for lunch so nice try in bringing down this superb restaurant's rating.This was by far the best meal we've had in metro Charlotte. I'd say all of North Carolina, but we've had some good ones in Asheville.Get the jar... bbq pork, collards and cheese grits with fried onions on top. THE. BOMB. The NC shrimp on risotto OUTSTANDING. My daughter's pork loin was great. The desserts were phenomenal (chess pie and apple cobbler with vanilla ice cream). EDIT: The jar is no longer available!!! So sad... I asked Paul to make one special for my daughter this past weekend, but I don't think that will work for everyone.Other items that made our table that were fabulous... duck confit, flounder, sunchoke chips and the soup of the day which was sweet potato soup.Worth the drive to Waxhaw. If none of the desserts at Heritage float your boat, Waxhaw Creamery is right next door!
