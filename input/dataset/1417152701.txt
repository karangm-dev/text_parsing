I wish you could rate food and service separately!  The food is a great value. But the servers are so lazy the only way you could get worse service is to have a 4 year old child who doesn't speak your language try and help you.  My granddaughters love this food.  I would be here more often if they could figure out how to wait on their customers. Please comment and follow me for more reviews! I would love to have you!
