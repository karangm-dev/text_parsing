They have people over there who know how to use the click button on camera they are not photographers.The lady who was clicking the camera made my little one very uncomfortable as she had no clue on how to control the umbrella flashes.I was told for 10$ more I can get a digital image, what I got was very low resolution with their watermark all over the picture.
