Decided I'd try this shop to get my nails done for prom. While the men were very nice, all the female workers had attitudes and were rude. Didn't get the color I wanted or asked for and a few of my nails were put on crooked and I was told it was because my fingers 'grow like that' not worth the 50 dollars I paid AT ALL.
