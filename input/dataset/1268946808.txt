As of right now....1 star and that's only because I had originally made an appointment for last Thursday (6/1) for 1p, and had to call just to find out that the appointment had been forgotten. Called today and left a VM. Hopefully this business can rectify the actions from last week and I will be more than happy to change my review. Here starts the waiting game. (Got a Groupon, too late to cancel and I don't want the credits. This has to work out).*Follow up (6/6): Ramsey just returned my call. Rescheduled for tomorrow Wed 6/7 for 11-1130a. Thank you sir!
