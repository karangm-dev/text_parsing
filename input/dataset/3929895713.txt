I received such amazing service from this Kal Tire location! I got a razor blade in my tire and took my vehicle there to buy a new tire and switch out my spare. I did not have an appointment and it was clear there was many vehicles to be taken care of before mine. They did not hesitate to come out and check everything out and offer a quick switch! I had my newborn daughter with me and we were heading to BC. They made sure everything was good for our road trip! It was exceptional service and I will be going to this location for any future services as I've never really used a kal tire before.Thank you so much for the great service and for ensuring my daughter and I left your parking lot safely! So much appreciation!!! Keep up the exceptional customer service!!!!
