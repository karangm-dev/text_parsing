Worst Service ever, lost my id last night at vintage and went up to the guy at the front for some help and he said and I quote "your fucked"...then I went back at 2:15am as directed and when I went to front door, it was locked and I banged on the door to no avail until finally after 15mins of banging on the door a security guy comes up to the door (doesn't open it mind you) and stares at me and gives me shitty looks and pretends he can't hear me.  This place is full of shitty people and shitty service
