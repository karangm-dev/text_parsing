My  Chinese wife and I ate here late one night and had a very delicious meal. We were trying to eat a light meal so we had a porridge , chicken and a green vegetable. It was quiet in the restaurant, the kitchen looked clean and so did the cooks. The service was helpful and friendly. We returned the next day and ate dim sum, it's obviously a locals favorite. We will return when we are in Vegas.
