This place is a drinking establishment first, dance club second, restaurant and quality of food is last. Basically if you've drank too much, go ahead and start soaking up some of that alcohol with a basic burger, wings or what have you. The place is huge, lots of Televisions, big dance floor and plenty of overly expensive alcohol. There are better places in Pittsburgh or on the North Shore to eat and drink.
