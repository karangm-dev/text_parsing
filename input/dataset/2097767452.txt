I know they're closing soon (or may have already), but I feel the need to vocalize how much I dislike the owner of the store.I must say that I have gone pretty often and saved a bundle on second-hand designer jeans, and quite a few tops as well. I am careful not to bring too big of a purse, because that usually means I'll have a salesperson on my heels during my whole trip. They have a "Wall of Shame" that takes up an entire wall behind the cash register, which I find to be quite crass for a boutique that sells strictly-designer goods. I get it, people steal. But printing out security camera photos and plastering them on a wall so that all your customers can see doesn't make me feel bad for you, it makes me think you're an a-hole. I also don't even know if that's legal...Anyway, on 3 occasions, the owner (a woman with shoulder-length gray hair) has been around, and each time has made me cringe for one reason or another. She is rude and condescending. One time, a man came in and was looking around, then asked if he could try on the coat on one of the mannequins in the window. The owner literally burst out laughing and said "Uh, no.". The man replied (way nicer than I would have), "So it isn't for sale?", to which she responded "No." Well, THAT doesn't make sense... why would you be advertising a coat in your window if it WASN'T for sale? Obviously she didn't think this man would either end up buying it, or couldn't AFFORD to buy it, and didn't want to bother taking it off the mannequin. Such awful customer service.At the end of the day, it never stopped me from going in because they really DO have some great finds; one day I found various Alexander McQueen items, impeccable quality, for basically a steal... but I shouldn't say that too loudly; I might get put on the Wall of Shame.
