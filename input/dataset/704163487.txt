I can't believe this place got written up in our Mt. Lebanon community magazine (which is the only reason we'd make the trek to a different part of town for a staple like hamburgers). Good beer selection, but the food was mediocre.  Buns fell apart as everyone has commented.  Buffalo wings were watery.  Odd.   We returned two items, and the waitress was accommodating.
