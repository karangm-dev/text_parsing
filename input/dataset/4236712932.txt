Babies R Us located in Henderson is my go-to store now that I have a little one. I've been shopping here for the last 6 months for registering for my baby shower and browsing to look at new items. The store itself is very clean, has a huge selection of items, and always has what I am looking for. This review is purely based off of the customer service that I have received every time I shop here. As I noted, I frequent here quite often and have finally had it where I feel that management needs to be aware of the customer service. Every time I ask an employee a question they always seem unenthusiastic and bothered. That's considering you can even find someone to help you. Today I asked the woman working in the "registry" department how to work the rewards kiosk and she was just down right rude and seemed so annoyed. When checking out today I had a return and the checker rudely replied "I don't do returns, you're going to have to wait". Sadly this rude behavior has happened EVERY time I shop. SO disappointing because it's a beautiful store and so close to where I live.
