Elegant old Church. Beautiful details.Restaurant week again in Charlotte and have wanted to try Bonterra for some time.  Made reservations and drove down tonight to give them a try.It's in an old Church in Dilworth and they have preserved many of the original features.  While dining is Elegant, attire is somewhat more relaxed.  This place has some of the best wait staff I have experienced in the Charlotte metro area.  These are not kids making a few extra bucks or working their way though college.  The servers are older and professionals in theri craft.Restaurant is the Pre Fixe arrangement where you get three courses for a set rate of $30.  Bonterra like most places allow you to upgrade your entree for a nominal charge.  In my wife's case, she upgraded her hanger steak to a 8 oz fillet for an additional $12 which was still very reasonable.We both started with salads. She had the Kale Salad and I had the Baby Arugula. From the description it sounded very similiar to a salad I had had a Delmonico's at the Venetian in Las Vegas a number of years ago and it was indeed, very close.She had her fillet and I have the Pork Tenderloin with Peach Sauce.  Cooked to perfection, nice and moist and full of flavor.For dessert, we both had fruit and cheese trays which were a perfect compliment to an otherwise perfect evening.We ill be back and probably will not wait for Restaurant Week to provide and excuse.
