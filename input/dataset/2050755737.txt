Wonderful variety in the beers, constantly refreshed selection, quick responsive staff and some delicious beer/combos make this the best beer bar in Toronto. Even something as simple as their yam fries is delicate and yummy. A number of beer-infused dishes let you experiment with brewed food flavours. You'll find something like 35 draft beers on tap, plus dozens more in bottles, so even the most demanding beer connoisseur will find something to satisfy their palate. Most highly recommended. The only drawback is that it's not a large space so it gets crowded quickly, especially since it's become very popular lately.
