I just moved here from out of town and have been coming here since April. I kept coming back to try and give them another try and I've still been disappointed. Some of the workers are great but others try to not get personable. This is why I miss my nail place back home. I came in at 10:30 am and they put me in a pedicure chair where I was waiting for 30 mins until they started. My water was cold and on top of that I had to also get a fill-in where they were taking people ahead of me because they had me in the pedicure chair. Not happy!!
