I would 110% recommend this place. I have been coming here for years. I've been here regularly for everything. Chiropractic, physiotherapy & massages. Everything has been great. The front desk staff can be fine or a disaster tbh but once you get past them to your appointment everything is fine. If you're looking for a new place to go I'd say check this one out.
