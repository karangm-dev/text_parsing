Like eating a pile of slop... and this is coming from a girl who likes all pizza, even Little Caesar's $5 Hot & Ready.  We ordered the Chicago style and the entire bottom of the box was wet from running sauce.  Hardly any toppings and sauce was so runny, they all slide off.  The sauce also tastes like tomato soup.  We were so hungry, we sucked it up, doused the pizza with ranch and ate.  So bad.  Please don't waste your money.
