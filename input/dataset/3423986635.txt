I came here once in the summer before their "grand opening", which I think is weird because since their grand opening, they've been very selective of the days they are actually open. I wanted to try the mole taco but they ran out so I had to order something else. Decided to try the fish taco because I like fish. Worst taco ever. The fish was tasteless. It was fried but it was all batter and little to no fish meat at all. Portion size is tiny. For $5 a taco, I'd rather get the big bell box at Taco Bell.
