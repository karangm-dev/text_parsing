After attempting to stay away from fish for a while so I don't poison myself with crazy Mercury level, I caved. Lol However, I don't think I've ever been so disappointed leaving a sushi place as I have with this place. It was mediocre at best. Not worth the price that they charge. Presentation is lovely but we probably should have known better from looking around. At dinner time in a large city to have just three tables in the restaurant was a sign. Never again.
