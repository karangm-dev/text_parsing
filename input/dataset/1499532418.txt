OMG this place is incredible.  I came here with a group of girls for a Zedd pool party over Labor Day Weekend and it was hands down everyone's favorite activity.  It's like spring break in Punta Cana meets Vegas meets LA.  Everyone is super cool, beautiful, and ready to have an awesome time.I love that they attract such good DJ's and the highlight of my day was dancing t minus 10 feet away from Zedd in my super cute bikini!!!!  I hope to be back here one day soon, perhaps next summer!!!!!
