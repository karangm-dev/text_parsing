A great choice if you want something warm, fast and relatively inexpensive for lunch or dinner! Deer Garden has a full menu and gives you a choose your own mix menu where you can select the soup base (they even have MSG free ones! I know, it's rare in Chinese restaurants), the noodle type, and extra ingredients from meat to tofu. In addition, it comes with a free hot beverage. And the almond milk is amazing (made from powder but still great!).the 4 of us ordered 3 bowls of soup and shared among ourselves. And tell you what, it was very filling! The tomato soup base is a MUST TRY.Overall, great experience would definitely come back =)And while the service isn't top notch, (nothing new in Chinese places), they did serve in lighting fast speed.Another note is the place can get quite busy around lunch/dinner time. Word of advice is to go 20 min earlier to skip the rush!
