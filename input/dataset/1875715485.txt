Please close the "deli" or w.e. you would call it. Yall can't handle more than 2 customers at a time and it always takes me 20+ min to get simple things. I have worked in the food industry for 11 years and this place just is under staffed.Great concept and idea that works for the meal plan side when they have time to prep but they need serious help on the deli side. I left after i ordered  a fruit smoothie that ended up being put last in line because other people got food after me. After 15 min of waiting and seeing that it wasn't going to be made soon i had just left. Oh well back to making it myself.
