We ate upstairs. The lamb dish was amazing, as well as the cobia. The tasting is definitly the way to go. You get a varity of Rick Moonens special creations. Service was spot on. We had the wine pairing as well. We had a show at 8. Server did a great job pacing dinner for 1 hour 45 min tasting. cant wait to come back.
