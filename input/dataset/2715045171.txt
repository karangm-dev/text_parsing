Standard club in Scottsdale.  Twenty-something women (mostly all hammered) being hit on by 45-55 year old men (again, mostly all hammered)...  And if that isn't a sleazy enough scene for you, then your thirst for the sleaze will surely be quenched when the unitard/booty short wearing bar maids climb up on the bar (Coyote Ugly circa 1997...) and shake it for the folks waiting 30 minutes to get their over priced drinks.  Maybe I am just getting old, but when the girls climbed up on the bar...it just made me feel bad for them and the person that thinks this is still innovative/cool for business.The DJ plays very little country music.  The drinks are really pricey.  Paid $18 for two 12 ounce beers...It is a cool set up...but the over arching theme/act in this place, just made me want to go home and shower.
