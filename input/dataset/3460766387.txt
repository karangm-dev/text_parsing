We were craving cannolis and called to order a few to go.  We just moved to the area and this was the closest spot with fresh cannolis. Their customer service was outstanding on the phone and continued when we arrived to pick up our to go order.  The cannolis were amazing and we will for sure be returning to try the pizza!
