We go to Line Thai often and love the food.  They have the best soups and curries.  This is one of our favorite thai food spots in Phoenix.  It's cheap and high quality.  Judging from the outside, wouldn't really necessarily grab my attention but is worth checking out for some good spicy comfort food.  I have been referred here by a few people separately and decided to try - definitely worth it.  And the wait staff is always friendly and helpful.  Feels a little like family when you're there.   Highly recommend!
