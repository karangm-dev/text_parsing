Wow, atrocious service... I came in because I was mailed a coupon for a $35 oil change with a complimentary inspection and car wash.First off, the guy who I dealt with had a real attitude... maybe he was having an off day, but by reviews below it seems to be a recurring theme... He was REALLY unhappy all I wanted to do was get an oil change. After talking him off  and denying his other up-sell strategies, he said that it would be about a half hour to forty five minutes, so go and wait in our lobby.After an hour and a half and a great deal of patience later, I said "I have to go back to work, whats the status?"... he said "Oh they should be pulling it around any minute..." 10 more minutes go by, and i walk over to see my car sitting around the corner unattended, unwashed, parked... Now, I am a little pissed and say my car is sitting there and it hasn't been washed. He claimed that he told them not to wash it because I was in "too much of a rush" (cynically also)... Didn't have the time or energy to chew the guy out, but hey I guess that's what Yelp is for...Avoid this place, it's a dump, and poor service.
