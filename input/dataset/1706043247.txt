Cupping therapy was much more intense than I expected! It gives you the same (if not better) results as a deep tissue massage in a fraction of the time. If you have tension in your back, this will help release it for sure. My upper back/shoulders experienced the biggest difference.Paul can find all your problem areas and focus on them... you might be surprised. See the pic I posted my personal results and check him out.
