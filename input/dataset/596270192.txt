Horrible Customer Service for 85 year old lady.  These people have no idea what customer service or common decency is and have lost my business.  Yellow cab participates in a shuttle service program to take seniors to the Pecos senior center. They receive a fare subsidy being part of the program.  They KNOW they are taking seniors. Some with challenges.  I set up my mothers schedule with them starting this week after Clean Air Cab who we had been using closed their doors.  She goes 3 times a week there and back so 6 rides a week.  Thats 6 fares a week ongoing.When setting up the service I explained she is hard of hearing and uses a walker and needs assistance getting in and out of the cab and that she is forgetful and to note to the drivers to make sure she doesn't forget her walker.Low and behold on the very first day we used Yellow cab, the driver did not help her and she left the walker in the cab.  Not happy, I called to have them bring it when she was picked up the next day and was told they don't do that and that it would be at their lost a found and it was my responsibility to come get it.  They weren't willing to have the next driver picking her up bring it.  Unbelievable.  After specifically explaining to them when we set up the service to note to the drivers so she doesn't forget it they basically said "not our problem".Not asking for the world here.  The driver couldn't get of his butt to help an 85 year old lady get out of the cab and make sure she made it into the house with her walker.  This is what our world has become.  What a sad place.Never use them.
