I was going to be in that area, so I searched the web for a new Vietnamese place to try. Upon walking in I was impressed with the over all  decor and style of the place. It has a nice outside eating area as well. I ordered an appetizer of pork and shrimp spring rolls and the combination Pho. I waited for my appetizer to come first, and was not happy when I finally was served with both at the same time. The spring rolls were very good and fresh, the peanut sauce was excellent. My soup was a large bowl with plenty of meatballs, beef and tendon, very good flavor. I began to prepare to add the basil, sprouts and jalapenos to my soup, when I found a string of hair, entwined with my fresh sprouts. I almost lost it. When I mentioned and showed it to my server, he quickly sent for the manager in the kitchen. He said he was very sorry and hopes that I will come back and offered me free desert. I told him thank you, but I have lost my appetite. He said okay, and walked away. I was ready to pay and was not impressed with the customer service from the Manager. My server then came back and said, he was sorry and did not charge me for the spring rolls. Oh why thank you. I love Vietnamese food and have been to few in Phoenix, with cheaper prices, better service and although may not have as nice decor, I do not think I will return to Saigon Kitchen. I recommend Pho Than on 19th Ave & Camelback.
