Beware! Don't use the on-line booking tool!  Even though it gives you option on-line and even via Yelp, I was told it does NOT work.  I was told to come back in 2 days.  Really?  Why would a medical company this large allow a tool to be shared with their customers that does not work?  Calling my primary to use another provider.
