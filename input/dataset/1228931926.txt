First timer here and thanks to Yelp, I won't be going anywhere else! Zev trimmed my beard and lined up the sides including my head. Excellent job. I didn't even tell him what I was really looking for and he said to just "trust me." Well I couldn't be happier, especially with the addition of the hot shaving cream and the neck massage, both of which I have never been offered elsewhere. Will return!
