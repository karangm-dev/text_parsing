Now you just can't go wrong with a burrito, freshly made, that's smothered withred chile sauce & melted Jack cheese or verde sauce & Cotija cheese with sour cream & freshly made pico de gallo. Mmmm mmmm!  that's what you get at Baja Fresh if you order any of their delicious burritos "enchilado" style.On my last visit, I ordered the Nacho Burrito . . . enchilado style. . . I wasn't disappointed.  Muy bueno!Couple that with their homemade salsa collection from their fabulous salsa bar, and your tastebuds will dance.Baja Fresh is my happy place. . . . I walk out of there satisfied and usually with half my burrito for dinner. Large portions, tasty fresh food . . . can't be beat!
