admittedly it takes something (un)extraordinary for me to bother to write a review...maybe i was just here on a bad night, but unfortunately doubt i would try againcame here with a colleague on a Wednesday night and was seated upstairs.  3 different waitresses took various parts of our order which was more so symbolic of confusing service than over welcoming hospitality.  after i was served my 2 plates, my colleagues gristly tuna was served which she chose not to finish.  we also gave up on our brussel sprouts which did not come after 25 minutes so we decided to wrap things up and move on.the tuna and brussel sprouts were at least removed from the billalso the co2 was definitely not correct when our tap beers were poured despite our waitresses' instance that the bartender checked it after our initial comment
