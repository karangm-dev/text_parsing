Perhaps the best brisket in town. Pricey though. I ordered a sandwich at lunch and it was $9.50! Our waiter needs more training. I wanted a healthier side than french fries and opted for Cole slaw. He neglected to tell me that all barb b q sandwiches have a compote of Cole slaw. So I had 2 little containers of mediocre slaw. It was not busy at noon maybe 10 customers total so I suspect the masses found a $6-7 lunch more palitable. The drink prices were basically downtown rates too. That means high for Mineral Point Road.
