The price for a Brazilian wax was great, but the experience was horrible. The worker was polite but not into small talk and didn't make me feel comfortable for such a vulnerable process. She had to redo areas multiple times, my skin was bleeding afterwards, and she left wax on that area (and on the string). There are still scars from my skin bleeding from such harsh pulling. I've been there twice and they weren't great but never as bad as this experience.
