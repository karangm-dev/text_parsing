About two hours after the Pepsi was delivered I got a call from the young woman who took my order and then was disturbed because I raised my voice.  She did not apologize for her poor judgment and attitude.  She told me she was going to give me a "full credit" for the $30.00 of food I had ordered. I told her since I had paid cash that would be difficult. She said she would see to it I got a full refund.  It was neither delivered to my door nor to the motel where I am staying.  So, not only are they inefficient, she's a liar.
