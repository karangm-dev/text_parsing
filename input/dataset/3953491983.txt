I was planning to buy (sight unseen) a certified used car from a dealer on the East Coast, and I was searching around for reasonably-priced auto shippers.  I found DAS on eBay, and they were 1/2 the price of the places recommended by the dealer.  They quoted me 14-16 days, and it arrived in just 10.  They underpromised and OVERdelivered!  Location updates were available online throughout the transit time.  Pick-up was quick and easy and the car had just been freshly washed.  I only wish dealing with the guys who SOLD me the car was as easy!!
