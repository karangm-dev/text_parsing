I wish every town I visited for work had this menu, thank you for providing great options! I stopped in here for lunch and got the full seared chicken salad. I was happily surprised it came on a bed of spinach, three pieces of thin chicken pieces- plenty to fill you up- some corn, fresh avocado, tomatoes and this AMAZING salad dressing I wish I could bottle up. They had a great menu filled with sandwiches and salads for all kinds. Also, they had a good looking wine list which I wish I could have participated in. The layout of the restaurant is pretty much concentrated in the main room, while take out orders happen in the back. If you like clean eating and really awesome looking desserts this is an ideal stop.
