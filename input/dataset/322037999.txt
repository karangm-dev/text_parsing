This is among the best sushi I've had in Phoenix. We came in hungry and tried... about half the menu it felt like. All of the sushi was great. The purple rice was interesting and I liked the texture. The only dish I had that I thought was mediocre was the fried rice. But the sushi was good enough to overlook that 1 slight hiccup.Downtown parking can, at times, be a problem. But it is worth the trip. We will be back in the next time we are downtown.
