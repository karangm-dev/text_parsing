Only reason we went is because of the deal we got from our stay with the hotel - buy 1 get 1 free. The food selection was very limited. The taste was bland and mediocre. The staff not too friendly and attentive.You pretty much serve yourself including drinks.Not much more I can say but will not go back there again unless it's free.
