I read on yelp beforehand that the Pad Thai here was quite oily but decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and ordered Pad Thai for take out anyway. I should've heeded the warnings!! Unfortunately, the noodles were drenched in oil and I had to try very hard to find the scamp pieces of chicken. The flavor itself was a bit bland as well. The restaurant interior was decorated nicely but I don't think the decor could save it from the less than mediocre food. I don't really understand why this place has 4 stars since I paid $11 for Pad Thai that had both underwhelming portions and flavor.
