Great place for high end treats. Very expensive.  You can find most of the items on chewey for half the price. Very rude too. Loved the pregnant lady that used to work there but she's on mertanity leave. Girl with short hair is blunt and unfriendly. They don't offer military or any type of discount but my dog loves the treats there. they used to offer samples and friendly treats but not since she's been gone.  They should give frequent customers either a discount & treat them nicer. Will look for another pet shop that sells the same stuff.
