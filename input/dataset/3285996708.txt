Annette is AMAZING!!!! If I could give this place 10 stars I would!!!! Since I moved to Vegas I've been very skeptical of letting ANYONE touch my hair. Not only is she ridiculously reasonably priced I'm talking HALF of everyone else I called, my hair turned out BETTER than the picture I showed her!!!! She literally looked at the picture of what I wanted ONCE and gave me exactly what I wanted but even better. No one has ever been able to do that for me being that my hair is extremely extremely thick and curly. Usually when I go to a salon they have no idea how to do my hair and charge my 3x what they'd change someone with "normal" hair. This is the first time in my life I've been this satisfied with a hair stylist. Thank you Annette!!!!
