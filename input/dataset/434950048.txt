Came on a friday night after 9pm.  It was pretty packed and had to wait 15 mins for a table.  I had their sweet walnut soup and a fruit juice.  The flavor of the soup wasn't what I expected.  I've tasted better with a more fresh and organic walnut flavor elsewhere.  However, the portion was big.  They had too much water in the fruit juice.  Wouldn't come again.
