Seriously the best pizza I have ever had! My favorites at Oregano's are their Margarita Pizza and their customized deep dish pizza. Super delicious, however plan ahead, because their pizza takes time to cook. I look at this place and see they make all their food with extra love; I am more than willing to wait and pay the price for eating their delicious food. Oh, and leave room for their pizza cookies, super super yummy! :)
