Seriously, ridiculously, fantastically delicious. I have had tons of hummus, but nothing beats his! It is crazy addictive and the price is pretty reasonable. I love the whole wheat pita chips and always pick up a bag of those too. My favorite is the basic garlic one (although it does a number on your breath, lol) with pita chips, but the super spicy one is great on wraps and he also has a feta dip that is great to use as a base for a pizza or in pasta. He is definitely a hummus master :-)
