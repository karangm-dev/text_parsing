I last paid a visit to this McDonalds about a month ago and ordered breakfast. Though it wasn't busy, the cashier took us to a kiosk and said she her manager wants patrons to use the machine instead of ordering at the register because they are "quicker." This was the second time this has happened and now we don't go back. Part of the experience of going to this McDonalds are the nice cashiers and interacting with them... especially when it's not so busy in the morning.
