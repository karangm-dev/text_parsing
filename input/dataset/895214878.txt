Dr Rhel is excellent. I am a RN and very particular about my physicians.  He is an excellent surgeon and I had a complicated sinus condition.  I felt in good hands and he was very thorough.  I healed well, without infection ( not always the case these days) and this is a direct result of excellent physician, facility and staff.  He is kind, gentle and answers all your questions completely.  I do feel his staff is a little unorganized but I'll take that to have a great physician.
