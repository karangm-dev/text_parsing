Sometimes you are so hungover at 6pm from the previous day in Vegas that you just need some cheesy fries and 6 pitchers of water. Outback is clearly the place to go for just that. After we were seated, we waited about 10 minutes without anyone coming over. A waiter from another section saw us looking hangry (hungry angry) and came over to see if we had been helped. He apologized profusely and took our order immediately. Our own waitress came by and apologized and ensured us she'd be helping us. The manager then came over without us requesting, apologized again, and told us he would comp the entire meal and to be sure to order dessert. All 3 of them checked on us frequently even though they were crazy busy. We were so impressed with the way they handled their service issues!!
