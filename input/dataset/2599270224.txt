I could've given Sal's Tomato Pies this five-star review at any point since I started getting pizza from them, because the pizza is, hands-down, my favorite in town. Truth be told, however, I was particularly prompted by Lynne D.'s recent review. Everyone's entitled to their opinion, and I'm not trying to change Lynne's mind, but I have to say this is a pizza worth paying for if you value high-quality food that is locally sourced. The ingredients are head and shoulders above what you get from many other pizza places. During the summer, I work at the Harmony Valley Farm farmer's market stand on the Square, and I'd be hard-pressed to think of a time I was working when Patrick didn't personally come shopping at the stand. What's even cooler is to, later that same day, see a picture posted on Twitter or Facebook of a featured pie that contains some of the very things I sold him that morning. That is farm to freaking table, right there.What Sal's provides that I don't find from too many other pizza places is a thoughtfully and creatively conceived pie (the ingredient combos are consistently amazing) that's made from high-quality and local ingredients. If that latter part is valuable to you, you're not just buying a pizza. You're voting with your dollars in support of a business that shares your values. And, in this case, the hot slice of ethos is absolutely freaking delicious, every single time.
