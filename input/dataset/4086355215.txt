My wife and I had arranged a 6 am pickup at our home for a ride to the airport to catch a plane.  At 6:10 she called to see why the cab was late, and was told that the driver thought the reservation was for 6 pm, and that they would send a cab immediately.  Time was too short, so we took our own vehicle, and were told to park in short term parking, and that they would pay the parking fees.  We said that we would be gone for 10 days, and short term parking would be $300.00.  Cab Guy said not to worry, that customer service was paramount to them, and they would meet us on our return with full payment.  Simon did meet us, but did not have our refund, saying that business had been slow.  He said he would have full payment for us in a couple of days.  After numerous phone calls and false promises over a period of five months, we have received $100.00, but now they won't even answer the phone when we call, or answer our phone messages.  We have obviously given up on ever seeing  our refund.  Scottsdale Cab Guy is an unethical company, and not to be trusted for pick up or any representation they make to a potential customer.  Try somebody, try anybody, else!
