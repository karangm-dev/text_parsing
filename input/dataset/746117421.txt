FABULOUS!!!  Not only was the food excellent the service was just as good.  AND the prices are extremely reasonable.  I had the Garlic Pepper Stir Fry.   I was with a party of three.  Must have stayed for close to an hour after we were done eating and never did we feel pressured to order more or that were weren't welcome.  The servers were just fantastic.  Can't wait to go back!
