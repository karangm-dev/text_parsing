My boyfriend and I booked this hotel spontaneously to take my little brother and sister out for a night just to relax and use the pool, etc. Had nothing but issues from the moment we checked in. I noticed quickly after doing so that they charged me a severe $187 for incidentals. Once I went back and brought this issue to their attention (it was a manager and an associate), all I heard back was "hmmm I don't know why that would happen..." Nothing else. I continually asked why and when my funds would return, and with 0 care was responded with no explanation and that they should return in a few days. Later on we called room service simply asking for a couple of forks to enjoy our meal with. The lady who answered, after 3 times of me calling and no one answering said: "Well we're super busy right now so that's going to be awhile". We were never delivered the forks. I used to have her exact position at a hotel being an order taker and a server for room service. It takes 2 minutes to deliver silverware. Do it while delivering another order. Very disappointing. Finally, once checking out the next morning I asked again about the extra charge with a different associate and she was a bit more polite explaining when I would receive funds, but still with no explanation as to why this would happen. I would not recommend this hotel. There are much better ones in the area for the same price or lower.
