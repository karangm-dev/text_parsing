There are two adultmarts McKnight Rd., and I definitely prefer this one. Let me start off by saying I'm not a shy person about taboo subjects. To me a trip to Adultmart is like a trip to the grocery store, it's a normal thing. The staff is friendly, helpful, and know the products they are selling (maybe first hand, I didn't really care to ask LOL). If you are not sure about a product, or exactly what you want, they'll help you. The parking lot is large enough to accommodate and I NEVER had to worry about finding a parking space. This one isn't 24 hours, (like the other one on McKnight Rd,) but!, this one is a lot bigger with a larger selection of "novelties". I've never been in the adult movies section, so I don't really have information about that.That being said, their selection is large. If you can't find one thing you want, I'd be genuinely surprised. Bottom line: Staff is knowledgeable, friendly, parking is convenient & plentiful, and selection is large. A must go at least once. Heads up!- They check id's everytime I have went in. (Probably cause I look younger than I actually am)
