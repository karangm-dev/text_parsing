Gaetano Palmeri is a bona fide professional.  Having dined at his place in Calabasas, CA years ago, he's not skipped a beat.  The menu will satisfy just about anyone seeking an Italian meal with a great range of starters, a variety of pastas, great seafood and meat selections.  We're fond of the warm cabbage salad, but tonight we opted for the special arugula with goat cheese and champagne vinaigrette split.  My wife devoured the barramudi with chopped tomato and I coasted along with a risotto with chicken and asparagus.  Perfect mid-week meal.The dining room is so comfortable in a refined way.  Murals and mirrors on the walls with soft but adequate lighting goes beyond inviting.  A full bar can start or end the meal and I'm told the desserts are special.  Can't say enough good things about Gaetano's.  We're not missing a repeat visit any time soon.
