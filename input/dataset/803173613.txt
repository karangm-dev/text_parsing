We were disappointed on a number of levels after dining at Bottiglia for the second time in as many trips.  The room is beautiful and service was good, but that was the limit to the superlatives other than the fact that the meal was comped.  My wife and I settled on a shared Caesar salad which was pretty much tasteless and rather petite for $13. We also shared an order of wood roasted Brussel sprouts with hazelnuts, ricotta salata and pomegranate that was dried out from overcooking and served at almost room temperature.  We did not fare any better with our entrees of pan roasted halibut with farro risotto, carrot puree and peas.  I had specified on ordering that I wanted the fish medium rare, but just like on our previous visit, the fish was overdone.  We also ordered strawberry panacottas that were larger than expected, but not nearly as smooth nor flavorful and one would expect.
