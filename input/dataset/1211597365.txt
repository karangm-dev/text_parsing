We had eaten at this restaurant at its former location and loved the food. When they moved to this location a year or more ago we tried it and it was a very poor, buffet experience. Based on the yelp reviews we went again as we could not square the reviews with our experience. Well, the reviews are right on. A lovely experience and great food and service.
