I wish there was an option for zero stars.. I am standing here at the balloon counter now. Experiencing the WORST customer service i have ever had. Meanwhile the manager is standing here and I had to ask him to help the grumpy cashier while she is overwhelmed trying to ring people out and blow up balloons. I will forever go to the one on Ann and centennial
