This review isn't for a stay, but for a meeting.We had a huge meeting here with about 500 people and Embassy Suites took really good care of us. The space was large and comfortable and the staff made rounds clearing our tables but without getting in our way. There were plenty of bathrooms to accommodate all of us breaking at once.  They fed us both breakfast and lunch buffets. They had a few stations set up with the same offerings so even with such a large crowd, I never had more than 4-5 people in front of me in line. The breakfast was good and they had the standard juices available plus tomato and mango. The lunch was super good. It was just sandwiches with salads and chips. But oh, I want to go back to eat in their restaurant just for the salads. The potato and pasta salads were some of the best I've EVER had. Too bad I usually don't like those much and only put a little on my plate. (There was plenty left for me to go back for more if I had chosen) The chips were house made and soo good. I would definitely recommend them for meetings, banquets, or receptions. Very well done. Thank you Embassy Suites for making our 10 hour meeting bearable and even enjoyable.
