Overpriced is not even the issue here, I've had better food and baozi at places that are a fraction of the cost and the portions of some dishes are ridiculous. Came here because I kept seeing their ad everywhere, now I see their need for advertisement. Also when we came in it was pretty filled up on the first floor so we asked to sit on the second level and they told us it wasn't open yet. However 5 minutes into sitting down a couple that was perhaps a frequent customer was immediately shown upstairs. Then another family behind them also asked to sit upstairs and was also refused. What?! Definitely won't be coming back.
