I'll explain why this is the best restaurant i have ever been .!!!Its been said we eat with our eyes first.... there is no better place as this one on that regard .!!Their dishes are beautiful presented ... as if every dish is a piece of art ... the meticulous work Chef Sean Murray puts into it is outstanding!!.The flavour every dish has ...is not just pretty ... flavours are there too.!!The friendly service .. the whole team at DS is very attentive and friendly.!!What you get for what you paid ... on all the restaurants i have done so far DS is the best Value vs quality 65$ is a bargain ..!!  And add 30$ for a wine pairing ..!!! The menu they offer is worth way more than the 65$ they ask for .!!The restaurant it self ... is beautiful very intimate with an open kitchen ( they will be closing the kitchen with glass soon .. so the chef can have kore privacy ) the lamps are made by a local artist ..wooden chairs wooden tables ... and every table has a granite brick with the name of the person who placed the reservation ( very original touch ).They change their menu every 6 to 7 weeks .... to make you ( like me ) go back and try every single menu.!!!For all those reasons and more .... this place deserves nothing less than 5
