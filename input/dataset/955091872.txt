Nice rooms. The reason for the two star rating is the POOR customer service we received at check in. We spent 40 minutes with the front desk lady .She could not find our reservation.The woman that was helping us was the most unprofessional front desk staff that i have ever had to deal with in my life. She could not answer one question I had. She was more worried about charging my credit card .
