I had an MRI there and they were extremely nice, accommodating and understanding of my need to be comfortable since I was in a lot of pain and a wheelchair. Both the patient care and MRI technician were very thorough on why I was having it done and what we were looking for/ruling out. They made sure I was comfortable the entire time from start to finish. I would go back there anytime and feel like I was in good hands. I even got a copy of the CD as I was leaving. Thanks everyone!
