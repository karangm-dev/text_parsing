The menu needs some help! I expected a lot more from this place. Half of the items I saw on Yelp and wanted to try have been removed from the menu :(. The ahi tacos were great ( a bit pricey) but the Fireball wings I ordered were dry! And they tasted like regular hot wings, nothing special. The drink I had was good.
