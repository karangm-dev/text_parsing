Please be aware!!! If you have a dairy allergy be cautious as they will put sauce and cheese in ALL pizzas regardless if you ask for it or not. I had that issue and called over to ask why the pizza had cheese. After talking to them over the phone we agreed that I will bring the pizza with cheese over and pick up the new one that I ordered. After arriving there for pick up, that was a different story and now I had to pay for the pizza and throw away the other one as I was not able to eat it. Very unhelpful with getting the situation resolved. Also watch out for the additional cost for the gluten free crust as well. According to them, the Tuesday coupon only applies to their traditional dough (no mention on the coupon about that) except 3 dollars extra for the miracle dough but nothing about the GF. I guess a customer ya to mind read and figure out what their internal policies are since it is not spelled out anywhere. Anyways, they can keep their business specially knowing that the pizza I ordered will have to be thrown away. Do not recommend.
