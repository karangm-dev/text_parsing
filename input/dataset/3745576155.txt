Definintely a fun place to visit for all ages.  Everything is hands on and lots of things to learn.  There is so much to do and have a lot of exhbits to show.  From learning how to cook or strapping on a harness to learn how astronauts do stuff, it is a real treat for the kids and adults! There is also the USS Requin exhibit that allows you to tour the submarine.  I had no idea that this was the US Navy's first Radar picket submarine! After you are done with the science center, walk on over to Sports Works! (it is included in the admission). It is so much fun but requires a lot of physical activity. Make sure you are wearing comfortable clothing as some of the exhibits require you bouncing or running. There is a parking lot that was easy to park in, but i can imagine when the local games are playing, it can get packed.
