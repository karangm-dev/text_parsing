Great food, I've been here about 4 times now. Every time the food is great and service is great. I've tried their Jumbo Fried Shrimp, Fried rice, Breaded Elote Balls and the Steamed Shrimp (Urban Mix). So far everything is really good. Also I really like their garlic bread, if you like garlic butter then it is a must.
