I went to Paul Mitchell The School after I saw a $19 Groupon for $30 towards a service.  I called at 9:30am to make an ombre hair color appointment with a Phase 2 student.  The receptionist was able to book me a 1:30pm appointment that same day with Jaymee.  Even though Jaymee is a student, she really knew what she was doing.  She was teaching a newer student (Rachel) about the techniques for ombre.  It made me feel very relieved when Jaymee was explaining each step of what she was doing.  Because I have very long, dark, and thick hair, I knew the appointment was going to take a while.  After starting at 1:30pm, I was out by 5pm.  This is understandable due to my hair and because students need to review their actions with their instructors.  Keep this in mind if you are thinking of coming here.  I feel 100% satisfied with my hair color service by Jaymee.  I also enjoyed the complimentary hand and arm massage I received from Rachel.  Overall I give the service I received 5 stars!  My ombre dye job cost $50, after I saved $11 from buying the Groupon.  What a great deal!  My suggestion would be to request a Phase 2 student (especially Jaymee!) if you are planning to get a color service.  It is well worth the extra ~$10.  Another great thing I found out is that men haircuts are $5 on Tuesdays.  You won't regret it if you come to the Paul Mitchell School.  If you're hesitant, please remember that all students will be supervised by a licensed professional.
