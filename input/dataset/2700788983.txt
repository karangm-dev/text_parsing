If I could give zero stars, I would. I brought my little 15 lbs pup in because I wanted to put a basket on the front or back of my bike. Immediately I was yelled at "don't bring that dog in here" I even attempted to say, "even if I hold her?" And this guy yelled, "no, get it out of here." I was planning to buy lights, new brakes, a front and back basket and new tires. Needless to say, never going back and I don't know how they're still open with how "busy" they are. Total shit hole.
