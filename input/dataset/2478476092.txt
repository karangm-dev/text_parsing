I live in Colorado, BoW customer there.  I walked in on New Year's Eve, had some needs.  They were open and Rosie couldn't have been more friendly or helpful.  Answered every single question, processed things smoothly, great sense of humor.  They had these green "excellent" strips facing the customer. I believe so that is the customer expects that level of service.  Interesting technique - it seems to work!  I liked her so much I mentioned her to Jeff, the branch manager.  Go see Rosie and tell her Scott from Colorado said hi!Oh and a tip - if you are on foot and by bus in Vegas, the Sahara bus accepts Deuce bus passes. Bus will take you half a block from this bank.
