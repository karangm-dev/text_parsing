Everday Noodles is a godsend. The food is fantastic and unlike anything I've ever had before. I had the sesame cold noodles for my entree, which were refreshing on a summer day and were delicious. All of the buns were bizarre but flavorful from the pork belly ones to the two kinds we had for dessert (the 'crispy creamy' and the 'sweet egg yolk'). The server we had was cool and so were the interiors.Oh, I forgot to mention the soup dumplings. I'd never had them before, and I'm in love. Ours were filled with pork and crab. Awesome. Go.
