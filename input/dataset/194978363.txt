This Kansas girl is always on the lookout for quality bbq and Pork on a Fork did not disappoint. The key to identifying a good bbq joint is their brisket. Theirs was perfectly smoked, great smoke ring just enough fat remaining to seal in the juices. The sausage chicken and pulled pork was just as perfect. Finally if you are a sauce person definitely try what they have to offer. Now what about the sides? Those too were made to perfection, don't miss the Mac and cheese and when they ask if you want seasoning on it say YES. If you are anywhere near one of their locations in Phoenix stop in!
