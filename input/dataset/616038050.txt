There is no acceptable answer for equipment to be down 2-3-4 weeks. The steam room here is broken (by members they are sure to tell you, bullshit) and has been for at least 3 weeks. They say we are waiting for parts. Ever hear of FedEx? But when your membership is up you are almost assaulted, threatened that if you don't renew TODAY you might lose that membership and not be able to get it back, FIX the EQUIPMENT!!!
