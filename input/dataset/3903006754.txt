I cannot in good conscience recommend Public Storage.  I have never had a direct problem with the on-site staff.  They have always been helpful whenever I have needed assistance.  The cart situation at the facility has become a joke.  I now bring my own means of transporting anything in or out.My biggest issue with the company has been their pricing.  Since renting my unit three years ago, they have raised my rent several times.  My rent is now 50% more than what I originally agreed to pay.  When I left the state, I had items which I could not take with me but I did not want to lose.  Now that I am out of the state, they have me over a barrel.  They can, and do, raise my rent regularly.  When I call to complain, they tell "that's the going rate now".  But, that is not what I signed up for.  I can understand raising rent occasionally, that's proper business.  Fifty percent increase in three years - ridiculous!If you are planning a longer term rental, find a better company!UPDATE: 4/26/2018 - They continue to raise my rent!  According to the email I received today, they are raising my rent again at the end of May to ALMOST DOUBLE WHAT I ORIGINALLY SIGNED UP FOR!  Since signing up with them 5 years ago, they have raised my rent by 95% of my original contract.  They have me over the same barrel, as I still do not live in the States.
