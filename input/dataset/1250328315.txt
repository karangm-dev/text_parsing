Was dealing with photo center and my photo gifts were to be delivered on a specific date. I went back to Walmart on that date that was printed by the ticket from the photo booth and the products have not arrived. Now I couldn't deliver the gifts on time for my friends birthday. No matter I told my friend I'll deliver it to her at a later date.4 days after when I was suppose to of receive the photos, I get a call from walmart. I couldn't pick up because I was working l. I called back and it took about 30+ minutes on the phone to reach the photo center. The operator on the phone was helpful but even I sense she was inpatient now since it took more than 5 tries to reach someone on the phone at the photo center. When the person at photo center picked up, she had a less than respectful customer service tone.
