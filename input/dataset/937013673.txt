So, we decided to forget about watching what we eat and ate 4 appetizers, tapas style, and topped it off with the dessert trio.... out of all 7 items I must say that they deserve 10 stars out of 5. Amazing food, well prepared and presented..... and the servers are up to par to the food.... the ambiance is perfect.... I highly recommend this place....
