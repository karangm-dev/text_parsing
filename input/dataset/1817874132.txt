The setting is very nice. The fish presentation makes your eyes pop. We had the sea salt crusted "sea bass of the med" it  literally melted in my mouth. We also had the fish roe app, it looked like humus but tasted awesome. The reason for the low rating is because we went here for the octopus. Supposedly it's the best in town, it's not. We sent it back, the meat was very tough. The server came back and told us it was 86'd because other guests returned it as well. They didn't offer us anything else in its place. No other app, no free drink, no dessert. I think they handled it very poorly, I felt snubbed. We did order dessert, and it was ok. I'm not sure I will go back. The food was very delicious, for the most part, but if something is not to satisfaction they are not going to do anything to make up for it. Even though the food was admittedly their fault, they made us feel guilty for returning it. I can't justify spending 300$ for that low level of service.
