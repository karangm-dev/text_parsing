This place is fun! Went here in the late evening on a week day with a friend who lives nearby. They play music (and sometimes everyone sings along!). Burgers are excellent. I ordered a protein style burger that I split with a friend. They actually brought it out separate for us along with the fries. Drinks were delicious. Service was speedy.Also, they have a yelp check in special! Can't wait to come back again.
