I have my Starbucks Gold card on me at all times. I was so excited about this Starbucks opening as it is close to work and I can get my Starbucks fix on my break. The best part of this Starbucks is that the drive thru is in between the two buildings and shaded in the afternoon. This has to be a plus for the employees too!  I have to give a shout out to the barista who helped me today in the drive thru. My kids were so thirsty and he cheerfully gave them a cup of ice water. Don't mind tipping for that!Another great thing about this particular Starbucks is the scenery. You have a great view of the mountain.
