Very long wait (I get it, you're new). It seems like drive thru staff at window don't pay attention. They tried to send me on my way without giving me half my order. I ordered an iced mocha that came completely unstirred. What I ended up with was a mouthful of chocolate syrup, because the milk/espresso was all on top, with a pile of chocolate on the bottom. What drive thru DOESN'T STIR DRINKS? (Yeah, that's what we want to do, open a drink, in our car, and try to stir chocolate syrup into a cold beverage...)The sandwich was good, though VERY small compared to places like wildflower bread Co., and paradise bakery. Also, the tuna to mayo/dressing ratio seems to be off. I feel like I got a sandwich that was mostly mayo. I don't think I'll return for that. All in all, 11 bucks (after tax) for a coffee drink and a sandwich. That price seems high, for what I received, after a verrrrrry loooonnnnggg wait. I think I would rather go elsewhere.
