Mason is amazing. Butternut squash items were amazing!  A must. Staff was very attentive to our larger group of ladies. Wait was a bit, but the restaurant was packed. Took a while for food to come out. But the staff kept coming by to tell us this, so no worries. We truly enjoyed all the different courses! Def going to be coming back!
