Nice decor. Fancy, over rated, expensive. Great customer service.Had the Kobe beef which was overpriced. Meat looked like it was cut when frozen then defrosted. The set up was interesting. You are to cook the beef on a small stone. Comes with 3 different types of dipping sauce. Meat was not at all good. & the plate was Over $100! Priced at $30 an oz. Would not recommend. Spicy ramen dish. Was alright. Nothing special about it. Had the spicy shrimp as appetizer. Was okay. The rolls were alright.
