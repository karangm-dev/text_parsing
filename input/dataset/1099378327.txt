EXCELLENTAlways fresh and tasty.They first serve your table with chips and 2 salsas with beans and grilled onions and serranos.Then we always get the fajitas for two with steak and shrimp. It is always very tasty.Comes with sour cream, pico de gallo, guac, tortillas, rice and beans for each person.We dont live close so we have not tried their other menu items, but they all look great.Each time we have been here there has been live music. (GREAT AMBIANCE!)NOTE: Friday and Saturday nights for dinner can be 1-2 hour wait.
