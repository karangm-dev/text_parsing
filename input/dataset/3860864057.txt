This place won't be getting second business, went in and ordered a shrimp burrito which was great, but also ordered a fish taco to try. The fish taco tasted off and asked for it to be sent back to get another kind or a refund. The worker said he'd talk to the chef about it. Waited for a bit and nothing happened. Saw the guy cleaning table on the other side. Didn't get a new taco or my money back: I don't like to make scenes so just came to the result that won't be going back
