I just rediscovered Bagels N Bialys.  (Took my sons to the original location for years and then just lost touch when they moved....which has been a while.)  All I can say now is why would I have breakfast anywhere else?  The corned beef hash is amazing, the omelettes perfectly made, and the French toast is heavenly.   Service has been very good and the pricing is reasonable for the substantial portions and quality you get.   A neighborhood gem!
