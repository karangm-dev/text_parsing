An underground venue which seemed very- very outdated. The menu only offered junk food, the comedians were very depressing and bArely funny. With only the headliner who got a few laughs...The drink options were minimal and the seating was uncomfortable, although every seat had a good view of the tiny stage the seats were terrible (old, hard and unsteady) Many seemed un pleased with having to share their table with strangers.The waitress we had was quick and organized.Definitely not an upscale place lol! But an ok thing to do when there's nothing else going on I guess...
