I came here looking to get a puppy and they a multiple breeds here. Unfortunately I didn't end up purchasing a pup from this location because of the rude customer service here. Most of the staff here are rude and have attitude problems. I asked a staff member to see one the the Frenchies and her response was "Are you looking to just play with him or purchase because he plays too much". First off, what gives you a right to ask that question? Yes I was highly interested in getting a frenchie, but that quickly deescalated. I asked another staff to see a different pup and she wasn't as friendly as well. I ended up purchasing a puppy at Petland in Henderson. Much better customer service and friendly staff. Highly recommend the Petland in Henderson you will fill more comfortable there when purchasing a new puppy. I returned to this same location to return an item and apparently even though they are the same company you have to return items at the exact same location you bought it from. The staff clearly explained that to me with attitude. Staff needs to be trained the curtesy of customer service here. This location is closer to where I live, but I'd rather go out of my way and drive to the Henderson location for friendlier staff.
