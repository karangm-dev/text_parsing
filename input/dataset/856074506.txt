i've had nothing but bad experiences here. the owner was not very welcoming, never buys any of the clothes i bring in (jcrew, madewell, c.wonder), and always says they're "backed up" with their buys. i've received texts when my "buy" was ready, but when i go back to the store, the ladies behind the counter act like no one has even gone through my items. so, then i wait for 10 minutes while they figure it out. here's a suggestion: get a standard process in place and stop wasting your customers' time.all of these things wouldn't bother me so much if i didn't see other brands/clothes literally from the early 2000s for sale in the store.i won't be going back.
