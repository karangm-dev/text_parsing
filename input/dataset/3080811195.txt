We ordered a stone bench from here and we were told that it would arrive on Friday.  We were having a  party on Saturday, so we wanted to make sure that it was going to be there.  We were assured that it would.  It did not come.  When we called they had no record of the purchase and the girl that answered the phone was extremely rude and unprofessional.  After about an hour on the phone, and the girl swearing at me, the error was figured out and they sent the bench that day.  Too much hassle to save a few dollars.  The bench is awesome we love it, we will never return to this place, save yourself the headache.
