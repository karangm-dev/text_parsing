This is the worst experience I have ever had with a rental company we did everything that was asked of us during the move out, the landlord came in and took pics before we had a chance to get it all cleaned up and used those pics to keep our deposit, I paid for things that were already defective upon move in, if you do use this company make sure you do a thou row inspection before you move in or you will be fixing up there properties with you're dime, AWFUL costumer service,Very RUDE to work with Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else for your rental needs or you may loose everything you put into it.
