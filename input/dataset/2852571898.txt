I'm in Madison for work and came across this place in July.  The coffee is great (love the house dark roast) and the grilled cheese sandwiches are worth every calorie!  I've tried at least 3 different versions and they were all fantastic!   The coffee here is as good if not better than the Intellgentsia coffee I pay considerably more for in Silver Lake.
