Landlord would not allow satellite dishes so I had no choice but to use cable. The video quality was not as good as satellite, but this was a short-term move so I figured I could live with it. The picture quality continued to degrade and pixellates constantly. I finally called last month when the pixellation got much worse and the picture kept freezing and skipping, (audio not affected). I was told that they were working in the area and the problem was temporary. I explained that the problem had been there for at least 2 weeks, but the tech support refused to help me, just kept saying that it would get better. It didn't get better, sometimes it was even worse, the middle of the screen had a pink section and the edges would be in B&W. I am moving soon so I just kinda lived with it.So I called today to cancel service, you can't do it online, you HAVE to call customer "support". Spent 30 minutes on hold, the process wasn't too bad once they finally answered the phone, except that I have to deliver the equipment to a Cox store. Direct TV sends pre-paid shipping boxes, I guess they care about their customers.Wish I could have given them 0 or negative stars, COX really sucks on internet speed, picture quality, and customer service. If you can, go satellite!
