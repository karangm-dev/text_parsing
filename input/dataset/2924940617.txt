Sitting at the bar. Been here for 30 mins. Served drinks fairly quickly. Bartenders can't keep up. A guy came to help the lone girl bartender. Still haven't taken our dinner order, drinks are empty. Trying to get someone's attention to check out. Finally got his attention. Going elsewhere for dinner and won't be back.
