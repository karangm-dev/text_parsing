It's been three weeks since the order was put in for my chest X-ray with Rosa and to date no phone call was made to my insurance company nor me as a patient and I was a NP with a new doctor (Dr. Mirabel). Where I like the doctor and I thought she was extremely thorough her staff lacks a lot of professionalism but they're a big company within Hendrson, NV 89052. My son went there too and didn't have a great experience with the front office and I had to follow-up several times in order to track down the status which is what I thought a PT Ass't did. I took it upon myself to handle and get straightened out but I shouldn't had to.  I just think it's really bad service when you go to a specialist like this and they leave you hanging. I did call the specialist again spoke with the front office and they said that somebody would get back with me that was the end of last week and it's Wednesday of this week and I'm still waiting to hear from someone so it's almost been a week and no one has called me back. I'm glad I don't need immediate service but still Rosa should of done her job and not kept me waiting. I would think twice about going to this practice unless you're in dire need of an ENT and you don't mind waiting around and you don't mind doing your own legwork in order to get testing done. But this place would definitely not be my first choice after reading this review.
