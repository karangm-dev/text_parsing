This venue is essentially an emptied out warehouse with plastic lawn furniture put on the inside.  We were promised a star chef, but in reality got chicken kebabs and rice served cold and buffet style.  They claim their chef studied in Lyon, France for five years but it was clear he was studying at a local fast food restaurant the whole time.  The event was supposed to be open bar but they had run out of all alcohol by 11 pm, even though they only had one bar and three bar tenders for over 150 people.  I would highly recommend not going to this venue!!!!
