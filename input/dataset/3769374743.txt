Liverpool House lives up to the billing, unlike the football club in the English Premier League. A group of friends and I came to Montreal for a bachelor party but our group was too big for Joe Beef. Liverpool House, its sister restaurant was able to accommodate our party with a family style dinner.The menu is chef's choice which comes with an array of appetizers, mains, side dishes, and desserts. My favorites were the Horse + Bacon tartare, Lobster spaghetti, ribeye + foie, and lemon meringue + crumbs. We all felt like we gained 5 pounds after this monstrous meal, in which we probably tried everything on the menu. The service was impeccable and the atmosphere was relaxing.
