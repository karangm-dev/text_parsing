.... my first time was a sunny afternoon in May, in the cool shade of the Evergreen Brickworks.  Six dollars?!  This better be good, I thought to myself.....That was two months ago, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about that mouth slathering, soul-filling pulled pork, guacamole and tortilla sandwich.I've been a bit of a boring adult these days; meal planning, watching my language, posting mommy-blog-esque quips on facebook, staying off yelp because I had nothing new or exciting to review... So when I found out that FG's was going to be at the Wychwood Barns beer market I dropped that ladle for the chicken soup I was making for my sick husband like a hot potato, ran across the street and then straight back home to enjoy my two sammiches.The pulled turkey with purple slaw and bacon jam was tender; sweet but also savoury in all the right places.  The beef short-rib and homemade kimchi made me break out in a post-coital sweat and I assured my husband that, yes, it is THAT good, while I tried to speak between bated breath.That was lunch.  I just enjoyed the second halves of each sandwich for dinner.I'm afraid I didn't get the proper names of any of those sandwiches, I do remember them being quite clever.  You will have to find out for yourself next time Fidel Gastro's pops up near you.  And please, give my regards to the one with the bacon jam.
