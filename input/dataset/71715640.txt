Amazing service!!!!! Would recommend to everyone needing body work!!! I came here because I was rear ended by another driver. This shop was covered under the insurance company and I was very happy to see all the good reviews, especially because all the other shops listed by the insurance had crappy reviews. I called to ask when to come in and they were very helpful and polite. They made the whole process so quick and easy. They looked over the car quickly and gave me a quick estimate in how long I would wait to get it back. They also called hertz and arraigned for them to pick me up. I received an estimate of repairs and completion date very quickly. I got the car back in about a week. The car came back looking like new. They even buffed out other unrelated minor scratches on my car. The car came back throughly cleaned as well and looking great. While insurance covered me and I didn't have to pay out pocket I will most definitely use them for any future auto body repair and will gladly recommend them to anyone else I know needing body work. They are a very well run and honest company that will get the job done. Getting in a crash and dealing with the stresses of it can sometimes be a pain and they made this part of it a very good experience. Bravo LVCC
