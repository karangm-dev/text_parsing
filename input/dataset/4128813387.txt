Very convenient location, in the same plaza as a nail salon, Chinese restaurant, beer distributor and dry cleaner (among others) so you can have the dog groomed and hit a variety of errands. They do a great job, the expanded store has a good selection and we have been groomed by several folks. My only complaint is they call you for your reminder literally as they are closing the day before your groom. A text or email reminder would be better. Pretty reasonable, full groom with hair bow for a 6ish lb short haired schnorkie is $37 plus tax. Wish also they would do evening hours one night a week.
