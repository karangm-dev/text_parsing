Horrible.   Went in for a mani/pedi.   Young guy asked to do my mani & the same time a lady was doing my pedi.   Completely unrelaxing.   Nails look horrible.  They have bumps and paint on my skin.    He rushed my manicure so that he could sit in a pedicure chair and play on his phone.   Strongly recommend going somewhere else.
