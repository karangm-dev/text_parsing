That place used to have very good food but not really good customer service.. But that last time I was there, the food was very bad and a very bad customer service.. No napkins on the table... They just have a sink to wash your hands before and after you eat.. But hey! You still have to find your own trash can to throw away the paper towels because they don't have one
