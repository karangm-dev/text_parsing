I just got my Landcruiser back from Tint Doctors. The owner, Tony works by appointment only, so called in and he set up an appointment for 4 days later. Dropped the car off at 9am and was shown all the available tints, made a choice and left it for him. The car was ready at 3:30, and looked great. He uses the best materials with a lifetime warranty. Not bad for Arizona considering the climate here. Great place if you need tinting. He also does detailing and I intend to try that too. I highly recommend Tint Doctors and am very pleased with the result I got.
