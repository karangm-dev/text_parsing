OMG - THE BEST!!!the key is patience and picking.For example, when I got there, I was a walk-in (reservations rec.). One-by-One, the lady or manager guy motioned that I was next. I said "no" like 3x. When I was there, there were 2 guy cutters and 4 lady cutters. For me, the lady cutter that is anally attentive (just watch her cut other people's hair) and the lady cutter who is the best dressed (did not wear a uniform) are the best cutters.am i pleased? TOTALLY.
