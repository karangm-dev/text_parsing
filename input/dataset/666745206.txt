My wife and I simply adore this place. Nestled within a lonely road right off of Lincoln Drive, this place is a hidden gem.We love the valet parking, the intimate outdoor setting, the views of the mountain and the open sky, and just the overall general atmosphere of the grounds of the Hermosa Inn.And the food is simply delightful! We've only had dinner here, but look forward to having breakfast here one day in the fall / winter.We have tried the Halibut, the Salmon, the Chops, and have always been impressed not only with the flavor, but also with the presentation. Truly marvelous to behold, and appetizing as well. When we visit, it's just fun to sit and chat with my wife as we enjoy the serenity of the area, and the delicious food. And the service is par excellence!We wholeheartedly recommend this place for special occasions, or a date with that special someone. Of course, to this day, I've had the pleasure of enjoying those special evenings here with my wife, my pal, my best friend!
