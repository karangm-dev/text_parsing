Hmmm it was a quiet calm Sunday night on my last day in town and my girl & I decided to go out for my birthday month! And I seen other steakhouses here in Cleveland but Morton is a favorite of mines in Chicago. We were greeted and seated very quickly. Our waiter was absolutely amazing ! She properly came back and fourth while my girl and I were indecisive about which drinks we wanted, appetizers, and even main course. Lol Our waiter took pictures of us with both my phone and the restaurant camera! And even printed them up for both me and my friend! It didn't even there! I was brought out there famous Sunday with chocolate cake bites inside ! Best celebration this month so far !
