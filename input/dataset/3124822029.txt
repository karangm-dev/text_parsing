Went to this buffet during their transition from breakfast to lunch. The breakfast selection was about the same as other buffets but the quality was second to none. The lunch selection was so versatile and the make your own sushi station was a great touch. I wish I would have saved room to try the high end deserts. All the buffet employees were friendly and helpful.
