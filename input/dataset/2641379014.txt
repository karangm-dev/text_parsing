Ok. So I've been to WaWa and they are pretty dope. Sheetz is a funny name and they informed us that they've been around longer than WaWa and they cover the northern regions and WaWa is more southern territory. This location was dead at 3 in the morning while WaWa has always been packed. But enough about WaWa. Sheetz is a glorified gas station store that has an ordering system where you can get food made to order 24 hours and avoid customer service and slip back into the night. They have sandwiches, Mex-American, smoothies, what have you. I dared to try a burrito style bowl - pulled pork, beans, rice, lettuce, pico, salsa etc. It was a good size (and it should have been for $7) but quality was very meh. The beans were hard/undercooked and there was more lettuce than anything and I got lots of toppings. The pulled pork was pretty tasteless and they put green peppers in when I asked for a mix of yellow/red. I haaaate green peppers. Blah. For 3 in the morning, I ate it but I was a little afraid I might get sick. Luckily that didn't happen. Quality was a little better than Taco Bell but not as good as El Pollo Loco. My boyfriend liked his sandwich though!
