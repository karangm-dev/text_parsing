Phenomenal experience from end to end! Everything we ate was unbelievably delicious. Their fried chicken is fall off the bone, juicy and tender all while having a crispy exterior. I came here with a coworker who was very skeptical about "fancy" fried chicken and one bite into his meal he was a believer and didn't speak the rest of the time until he was done with his whole plate. The entire experience was made even more incredible due to the service we received from Christine A. She made us feel as if we were in her home as a guest of honor. Her attention to not only us but all the other tables she was helping was remarkable. She asked if we had ever dined there before and I told her it was our first time and I was so excited and she genuinely became excited with me. I've never had anyone like her serve me and wish there were more like her out there. I can't wait to go to the Los Angeles location, I only hope they have people working there that are as attentive, fun, and welcoming as Christine was.
