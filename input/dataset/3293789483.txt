May have been the best dinner I have ever had.  I've been to Craftsteak and Prime; N9NE was a cut above.  We started with "Death by Caviar," which combined caviar and small hash brown type cakes.  Amazing, as was the pretzel bread with stone ground mustard sauce.We couldn't decide on an entree, so we split the pine nut encrusted lamb chops and the fillet.  While both were amazing, we nearly got into a fight over the lamb.  Our waiter couldn't have been more helpful from entre suggestions to wine pairings.  He even took the time to answer my various questions about the restaurant.I'm going out on a small limb, but I can't think of a place I would rate higher.
