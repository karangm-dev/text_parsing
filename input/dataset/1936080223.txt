Always around a 15-30 min wait to get in on the weekends, but always worth it. Usually great service by the wait staff, food is always prepared well, and prices are reasonable. Salmon hash is delicious. French toast comes in large quantities and is made with thick and fluffy bread. Breakfast burrito could be bigger, but it's tasty.
