The first thing that you notice is that the food is overpriced.Then you taste it.The worst burger I have ever had. And that comes from a lifelong experience with burgers. I would never, ever give it a second chance. It was greasy, fatty, flavorless, and metallic.The fries mirrored the burger.  An awful dining experience.This place is perched on the lowest rung. Lower than the corner greasy spoon.Steer far, far away from Fatburger. You have many other choices for burgers and fries, and they are all better than this place.
