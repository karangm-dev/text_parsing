Buyer beware I had Homelife as my warranty company for the past 2 years and they are the worse first off to get them to fix anything is hard. They will take the co-pay on top of the yearly fee and not want to cover anything. Oh wait and not to mention want to renew with any prior knowledge that they will charge you . I was over drawn 600 plus dollars . I called and was passed around for over an hour and then hung up on. I explained that I was not planning on renewing with them and wanted my 710 dollars that they took out of my account without any warning.  They said that when I paid last year that they told me I was on a renewal to lock in my rate to me it was a waste of money had them out twice and nothing was covered. I am waiting for my refund then cancelling my Bank account so this doesn't happen again.
