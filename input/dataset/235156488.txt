This pizza company is great, I have not had this pizza since HS. The flavored crust sets them apart. The sign is easy to see and was busy when I went tonight. We got the flavored crust, butter cheese with pepperoni and Howie Bread. I think I got food poisoning, sick from 11pm-2am. Not fun. Not going to eat here ever again.
