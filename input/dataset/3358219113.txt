When I went to go see Zootopia last week (great movie btw), I prepared myself to take the ultimate test of pop culture and moving pictures: TimePlay.To my dismay, this Cineplex completely skipped TimePlay and went straight to the upcoming movie previews.Is it too much to ask for the administration of a simple TimePlay test in this day and age?  How am I supposed to collect those measely 50 Scene Points and bragging rights if Cineplex fails to administer TimePlay?
