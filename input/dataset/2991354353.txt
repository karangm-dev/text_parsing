This used to be my go to place for mani-pedis. The owner is always cheerful and welcoming and I was always pleased with the job they did (especially since prices are reasonable). However, the last 2-3 times I've been there I've been very disappointed. There seems to have been lots of staff changes and they just don't take the same care they used to. Also, the selection and quality of polish isn't good (they never have updated colors) and the staff just isn't as friendly as they used to be. I splurge a few times a year on a manicure and pedicure but today's was about the same quality I could have given myself--combined with grumpy nail technicians. Disappointed and won't go back!
