Probably the worst place I've been (check out the sloppy pedicure).The guy doing my pedicure was slow and not very friendly and I think he must have been a dental hygienist the way he scraped and dug into my nails. And he didn't say two words to me. I guess he was taking to long and another guy came over, told him to beat it (in their language) and he did the white tip and let the slow guy finish with the top coat. Oh yeah don't come expecting a chair massage there are any. I gave it 1 star because for the music. It was a $30 pedicure not enough for me to complain; I just wanted to get the hell out of there. I definitely won't be back.
