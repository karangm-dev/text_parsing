The observation deck is great. My young children weren't very interested but that could be because they've been ruined by the Willis Tower. But, I love Cleveland. It's beautiful! So, I enjoyed the deck. The food court is nice, very crowded. Hard Rick is a plus at this mall. Shopping is pretty limited.
