Went into the new Dotties location the other day while waiting for new tires on my truck form discount Tire. Lost thirty five dollars which wasn't so bad. But, the most disgusting behavior from the man Steve working there.  First never asked me if I would like a drin. I had to go to the counter and ask after waiting 30min. So ok but the worst part is after I had to serve myself. Steve demands that I have to go push my chair back in before he will cash my ticket. What? I have never been to a business where you are demanded to push your chair in! I live near there and go in from time to time. As long as Steve the lazy rude guy is there I won't be back. Not recommended.
