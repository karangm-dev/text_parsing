Haven't even stepped in this place but had to give a heads up on here. Called for an appointment, they said one of their stylists would text me. We scheduled something for a few days out and then the day of she texts me that she got double booked. Passes me off to her partner and gets me in later that day. Great. I get another text saying that she's out of the salon and asked if I can come in at 6. Ok. Get another text, cancelled. Asks if I can come in tomorrow, I can, and then says she's not sure if she'll be able to make it. Will not be trying to make an appointment here again! Super frustrating for a mom who needs to schedule childcare to get her hair done.
