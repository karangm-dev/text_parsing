We regularly take our elderly mother who lives in assisted living here for Sunday brunch. However, this Sunday we had a very unpleasant experience. I asked to speak with the manager and the bartender spoke with us. He was extremely rude. We have spent hundreds of dollars in this place over the past five years.  Never again. We went down the street to Luke & Mike's Front Porch, and they were wonderful.
