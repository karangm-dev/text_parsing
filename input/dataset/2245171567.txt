After going to 7 different dealerships, I found Blake and am so glad I did! If only I had found him sooner. He found the exact car we wanted within 24 hours and at an amazing price! He was quick to communicate and truly listened to what we wanted. He made the process so stress free and has earned my business for life! Thank you so much, Blake! We will sing your praises to all who will listen! I can't believe buying a car can be so stress free and enjoyable! Thank you, thank you, thank you!
