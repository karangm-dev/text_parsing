Was definitely pleased with the level of service at the Hilton Toronto. I was greeted well by the front desk, who upgraded my suite as requested to the executive floor. They also ensured that my requests for a mini fridge and appropriate amenities were met.The room itself was stellar with two double beds, large desk and ample space to comfortably rest after a concert at the nearby Molson Amphitheatre. The front desk helped arrange transportation and have me a ring when my ride arrived.Checkout was painless and while I did have vouchers for breakfast at the hotel. I wasn't able to take advantage of it due to my schedule.
