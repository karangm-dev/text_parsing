I'm not actually a huge fan of jlo' recent songs but I love her old school duets with ja rule and ll cool j. But I must say that I absolutely loved this show. It was very well executed. The production was amazing. The lights were beautiful and the show had a true progression to it. She starts off with her earliest hits like love don't cost a thing and goes on to her time in the Bronx singing Jenny from the block, I'm real etc then to the newest and latest hits. Jlo dances her ass off in this show. Literally she dances to every single song. I don't know how she does it. She does this very sexy striptease too that makes me so jealous of her booty and her moves. She likes to be know as the hardest working singer out there and I must give her lots of credit. It was a thoroughly enjoyable night from start to end. The show is long too. About 2 hours. If you get a chance to go don't miss out!
