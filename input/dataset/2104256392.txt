I used to like coming in this store when Trevor was here but since the remodeling and change of staff its more like walking into a funeral home. So depressing and dull. No music just deafening silence. The 2 guys who work here now, Mike and some other idiot don't know anything about vapes. They're just really stupid and act like they've just woken up from a nap. No energy or excitement. Plus they are very very overpriced. Their juice is not great. The samples you get to taste are so drab and unappealing that it doesn't do much for me. I only go here because of its location but even that's got me thinking I'll go to Blue Dragon just because of the atmosphere and selection and prices. Red star, you really need to get your act together and make people's experience a positive one when they visit your store. Very disappointed!!!
