Came here before heading to the amc for a movie- I ordered the fried rice with mango chicken and mixed veg- it was ok. If I hadn't felt so sick afterwards I'd probably give it a 3.5 for being a fun movie theatre sneak in food, not too bad tasting and generous servings. But I did feel sick afterwards- I'm not sure if it was the amount of oil and sugar in the meal- or a mild case of food poisoning, but I'll have to give it a two for the tummy ache.
