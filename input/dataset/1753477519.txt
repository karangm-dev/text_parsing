Gave our car away even though it was reserved. It's like the Seinfeld episode " They know how to take the reservation they just don't know how to keep the reservation " Car absolutely filthy! Smells like 5 brothers lived, sweat, ate, smoked and then vomited In it for a week. How are these people still in business? Somebody, anybody please tell me.
