How has a class action lawsuit NOT been filed against  this company!? I will be reporting them and have an appointment with my attorney next week, and he is very interested in moving forward with this.  Their deadbeat drivers claim to deliver your package, but steal the item instead, knowing that Amazon will cover the customer with a refund or replacement. My "same day delivery" last Monday was supposedly signed for at 7:10pm at the front desk of my complex. The office, however, closes at 5pm so please tell me how this is possible. I opened an investigation with Ontrac the next day, and after jumping through hoops was told that the driver will come back to show me where he apparently delivered the package. Driver was a no show and refused to cooperate with the Ontrac dispatcher. I filed a driver complaint and was told that his manager would call me. That was 8 days ago, and I've contacted them 3 additional times since then...it is literally impossible to get a manager on the phone or get any type of explanation from them as to why no one has contacted me.  Even the dispatchers are trained to advise the customer to just reorder the item...apparently this happens all the time. Never have I had this problem with UPS or Fedex.  Anyone who is interested in discussing this class action lawsuit with my legal counsel please contact me directly.
