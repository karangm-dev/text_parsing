My first experience was good...my second...horrible.... The staff is rude, the owner doesn't care and my goodness if you have a scent allergy, stay away... the bartender wore so much fragrance, I couldn't breathe, taste my food or enjoy my wine... and the manager was so rude..... never went back, next door is Pizzaiolo   where I frequent since the rude women in  Bistro 19 think they own the place
