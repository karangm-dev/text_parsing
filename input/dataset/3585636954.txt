CUSTOMER BEWARE Saw ad for $7.77 oil chance with coupon, typical bait and switch. Manager Carlos immediately tried the bait and switch even though I was told different on the phone but that is not the big part of it.  When I asked to many questions as to why tell me one thing on the phone and another when I arrived he said get out. When I left as I was walking to my car I was bullied by several employees pushed and threatened I called Metro Police (event # LLV160518001189) When Metro wanted to see survelence camera tape they would not show saying they were not working, the truth they did not want evidence of assault.   THESE PEOPLE ARE BAD BUSINESS BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE.  With so many auto repair places in Las Vegas please do not support bad business.  This was a customer that went from an ad that was threatened as I was leaving.  Carlos and staff can not be trusted.
