If you're from out of town, you may see this store's funky outside as intriguing (it does look cool, as it has a prime location on Mont Royal). Appearances are quite deceiving. In this case, you walk in, and it's extremely cluttered, the records are jammed into their respective sections, and the prices are WAY out of line (especially compared to the MANY excellent shops you have in the area).Many prototypical record shops in the U.S have similar aesthetic properties (interesting exterior, hoarder's interior, useless clutter) and so, many tourists might drop in due to the window display, attractive lettering, or the fact that it's a small yellow building in a cool Montreal neighborhood...Avoid. This is in no way meant to be a vindictive review, nor is it motivated by that HILARIOUS South Park episode (You're not Yelping). The owner is a nice guy, and he knows his music. Problem is, his stock is wayyy over-priced and in (mostly) lousy condition. New records cost (on average 5-10$ more here... it just doesn't make sense. Also, there's no debit / credit card machines which is also a bit of a red-flag. This place relies squarely on walk-by's and tourists... otherwise, no actual record/music fan from Montreal would voluntarily go there.Want a good shop or two, or six to check out if you're in Montreal? -Beatnick-Aux 33 Tours-Cheap Thrills-Phonopolis-Death of Vinyl / Fin du Vinyl-Sonik   Good prices, excellent selection, knowledgeable staff... (Aux 33, Phono & Cheap Thrills are my top 3) Cheers!
