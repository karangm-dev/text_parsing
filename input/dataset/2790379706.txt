I've been coming here for years and it never disappoints. I remember the first few times I came it was closed because they are closed on the weekends I almost gave up thinking they were closed down but finally made it on a weekday and have been in glorious Korean food heaven since then. It's definitely the place to get authentic, homemade Korean comfort food. My usuals are the spicy beef noodle soup, rice cake dumpling soup, and the hot pot bipimbap. They replenish the side dishes if you want more (I always do). I saw they recently have added a few more items to their menu like a Korean box lunch meal and spam musubi.
