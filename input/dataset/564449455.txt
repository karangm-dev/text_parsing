I was really excited about trying out the buffet there, because it gets such great reviews.  Maybe I went on an off day or something, or maybe I just got my hopes up too much, but it really was not that great.  There was a huge selection, but the food itself was just kind of "meh" and there was nothing that seemed better than a Hometown Buffet or something generic.  The casino itself is fantastically beautiful, and it was worth it just to check that out.
