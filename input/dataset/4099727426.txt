This guy does the cheapest work possible and cuts corners.  He was on the list of covered dentists when I had a Sam's Club dental plan...  He's very friendly and funny, but the laughs stop when you find out he's a poor quality dentist.  He also didn't use the best protocol to prevent mercury contamination while removing my old amalgum fillings.  JUST DON'T!
