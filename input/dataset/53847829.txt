This location sucks , waited 7 minutes for the drive thru guy to say one word for me , waited 5 more minutes for him to even take my order . Got to the window , waited 23 minutes for him to open the window and take my payment , waited 12 more minutes for my smoothies to come out , only ordered 3 smoothies & it took 47 minutes !!!! ridiculous , don't ever waste you time & come here . he didn't even apologize for the wait let alone didn't say have a good night either . - erin & maddie
