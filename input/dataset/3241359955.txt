There is a reason I frequent Paul's Ace over the big names such as Home Depot or Lowes: the personalized assistance. Do the big name brands provide this? Yes, bit not at the same level Paul's Ace Hardware does in Tempe. If I need help, they are ready and willing to help me in every aspect of my project.The store manager Bras personally went out if his way to assist me in gathering all the materials I needed for my current project. He knows his store, bounced around to show me all options, and seemed to have recommendations on each project. This guy must love what he does because he knows everything in the store (or he is a constant do-it-yourselfer).I am always pleased with the help I receive and am thankful this place is in my neighborhood.
