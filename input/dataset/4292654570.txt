Customer service is off the charts...I had the most pleasant experience; Aaron is definitely open, honest and transparent. I took some jewelry to sell, which included a diamond ring that I'd not worn for many years. I did not sell the diamond ring on the first visit, however after some thought I called him back the next day. They are closed on Wednesday, however he made an appointment with me to come see him on Wednesday; he said it would be best as he could take his time; he would not have customers waiting. He  invested time in explaining what he was checking and what he was doing as he inspected the diamond. After this visit, I decided to sell my ring as I felt confident that I was getting a fair price for it. If I could give Aaron 10 stars I would; I told him I felt a bit unsafe walking to my car, he said if I could wait until he closed the shop up he would walk me to my car, which he did!  Thanks Aaron. As promised, I will stop by to see you on my way out of U.S.A.
