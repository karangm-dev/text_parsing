I should have listened to all of the horror stories about cancelled and delayed flights with allegiant air.  I have been waiting at the airport in Las Vegas since 10am for a 12pm flight...its almost 4pm and still waiting.  Apparently the plane needs a tire change.  the worst part is they have all of our luggage sitting on the tarmac beside the plane....almost 6 hours and counting....and its 110 degrees outside!  worst customer service EVER....oh yeah.....they gave us an $8 meal voucher. ...thanks for nothing allegiant!  Never again,
