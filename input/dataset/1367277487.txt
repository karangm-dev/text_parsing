I would give it 0 star if I could. The carwash damaged my rim and they refused to fix it. The car derailed in the middle of the wash, my car was in neutral and i didn't touch the break or steering wheel a bit. Somehow that was my fault the car detrailed. This was my first time there, on a busy Saturday afternoon. All they care was to shuffle cars to the machine asap so they can do more business. The manager was supposed to call me on Monday after discussing with the owner, but somebody called me on Monday and said the manager would called me on Wednesday instead. And Wednesday another guy called and told me they were not going to pay for the damage because it was my fault. What?! This place was recommended by my colleagues at work, and now I will make sure everyone at work (1000+ employee) know about my experience. They could have just paid for ~$100 repair, but now they are not going to get any business from me, my friends, and people at work. If nothing goes wrong, good for you, but if there is a problem, you are likely on your own. I am not going to risk it anymore. Stay Away!!!!
