Let me start off by saying that the best part of this meal is......LEAVING....... pale COLD fries, so an endless basket of them is no prize. There was something clumpy/doughy in the clams chowder, the wedge salad was like it had been sitting around for a long while. We ask for fries that were cooked and we get hard over done ones, like trying to be wise. Oh well, won't be seeing us again.
