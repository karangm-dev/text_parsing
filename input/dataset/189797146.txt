I ate at Ahipoki before at their location on scottsdale and Thomas and I really enjoyed it. I had not had a chance to be back for a while and was so stoked to find out that they opened this new location and it's really close to where I live. So I decided to come here for lunch and boy! I was disappointed. The portion is definitely smaller, the price is definitely more expensive and they upcharge every single item possible. I just hate it when business starts to take off and they do this. There are so many places to get Poke now in the Valley ( so I will be taking my business elsewhere. I won't be back here, unfortunately.
