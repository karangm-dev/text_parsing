The owners of this restaurant have another location in Charlotte that has been open a very long time, and I can't, for the life of me, figure out why! My husband and I LOVE a good deli and were so excited to see this place so close to home. The excitement wore off about 5 minutes into the visit. Service was okay, but felt like I had to order and get out in record time. I ordered a Ruben and my husband ordered a corned beef sandwich. They should be ashamed of themselves with the quality of bread and corned beef that they serve. The cole slaw and potato salad tasted like they bought it packaged from Walmart or Sam's Club. There is nothing special about this place and I can make a better corned beef brisket at home, which isn't saying much. Skip this place. Sadly we still have to wait to get a good New York deli in Charlotte and surrounding.
