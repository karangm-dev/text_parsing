Amazing food and service! We had the 5 course tasting menu and everything was delicious and plated so beautifully. The dishes were served in a timely manner and the flavors were very different and ingredients fresh. They also took note that it was our anniversary and served our dessert with a candle which was a nice touch. During our 3 day stay in Montreal this was our best dinner.
