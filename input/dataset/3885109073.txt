Let me just start this by saying that my husband is vegan so I have no problem at all with vegan food. However, the vegan food here is way overpriced, tasteless, and just plain boring! For $65 a person (no drinks included) I expected a lot higher quality. For that price you could go to a lot of restaurants in the strip and get an excellent two course meal and just eat it with your eyes closed to get the same effect as this place! Also I feel sorry for meat eaters because they only tell you it's vegan afterwards - why not just be upfront about it and say it's a vegan restaurant from the start? Is it because you know nobody would then pay 65 bucks for a vegan meal ?
