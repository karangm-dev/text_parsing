I wish that I would have known about this place sooner.  I have only been here twice since I only discovered it last month.  I had the turkey burger with fries and a chocolate malt the first time and I had the Frisco with onion rings and soda the second time.  I love this place!  Everything I ate from here was golden.  I can now say that I'm a Hardee's fan.
