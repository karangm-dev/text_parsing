***update still no call back from corporate** I had the worst experience today at this location. A female employee I believe she is assistant manager by the name of Dorthy. I asked my cashier Devante if I could take my items into the restroom with me after I had purchased them and he turned around and asked the female ( Dorthy) if I could and she rudely said no. I told her she didn't have to be rude and she said she wasn't with an attitude and shook her head. When clearly she did. So I continue to speak to my cashier Devante and she stood in the background and repeated herself again that I couldn't go into the restroom , which we know longer we're speaking about and I told her I wasn't speaking to her. I asked my cashier Devante for the corporate number and he said he didn't know it !!!!! What in the world !!!! She rud  says my name is Dorthy  if you need it to call. I told her I wasn't speaking to her and At this point she starts cursing at me in front of other customers and Devante. The store is dirty and no organization what so ever. I would never in my life go to this store again or any dollar tree store at this point. I found the corporate number online and left a lengthy voicemail. Let's see if they care enough about their customers to reach out to me. No wonder she wasn't afarud of someone calling to complain about her, I saw google reviews and other customers have complained about her !
