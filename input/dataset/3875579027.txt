As someone who is very picky about donuts, I wasn't expecting too much. However, Hurts really wowed me. First, the store is very colorful, trendy, spacious, and clean. Since many donut shops are rather grungy, this was a pleasant surprise. The donuts themselves were equally amazing. First, the donuts were incredibly moist. While I just had one, my friends all said the same. Secondly, the donuts were flavorful and fresh. Finally, the donuts were all clearly decorated with love. Although more expensive than Dunkin Donuts, I felt the price was worth it. The donuts were much larger than normal donuts, so I think paying an extra $1 (compared to other shops) is quite reasonable given the size and quality.
