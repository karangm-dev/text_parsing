This review is specifically for my stylist, Bobbi.  I haven't been to her at Cinema Hair Studio yet, but used to go to Bobbi for several years when she was at Cameo Day Spa.  She is by far the best hair stylist I've had in my 35 years of paying for haircuts (this doesn't include the first few years when my mom would cut my hair ;).Bobbi listens to what I want and also gives good advice on how my hair should be cut/styled given my hair type and face shape.  I have never, ever received less than a terrific haircut from her.  I have naturally curly, dry hair and have worn it short, long, curly and straight.  She has mastered all versions of my hair.  I've also had her do highlights and the results were wonderful.  I worked in a somewhat conservative atmosphere that required that I not have unusual looking hair.  However, I like my hair style to have something bold going on.  Bobbi came up with a terrific middle ground in which she used a purplish burgundy color (I'm a brunette) and mostly highlighted the hair underneath my top layers so that you could see the highlights more when I ran my fingers through my hair or when wearing it pulled back.  I got so many compliments on those highlights.  To top all of that off, Bobbi is just a fun, easy going person that is great to talk to while having my hair done.  Unfortunately, I've moved out of Madison and can no longer go to her.  But when I'm going to be in town, I make it a point of scheduling my haircuts around my visit so I can go to her.  In summary, Bobbi is an amazing hair stylist.  Do yourself a favor and book an appointment with her.  You won't be sorry.
