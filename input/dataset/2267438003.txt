Bought some dishes and the girl tells me she will come right out and bring it to my car for me because I had a two-year-old with me and it was hard to carry. I am outside in the heat for half hour now and two phone calls and still no dishes. Great customer service after I called twice already. Managers came outside and rectified the situation. They were great and apologetic. It happened and that's why good managers will address it. Thank you!
