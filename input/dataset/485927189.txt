Im a dude, not the fancy pants kind of guy who likes getting his hair done. When I left the Army I decided to let it all grow out. After several months of mulletus growth my wife made me an appointment with Lena to tame my shameful shag. I now sport a beautiful yet ever so manly mane of golden locks under the attentive care of Lena and Tula. Its a chill place that is equally as comfy to wait for your appointment and contemplate artistic style of Lena's brush as well as her comb. No really, she has some beautiful paintings hanging. They will even offer you tea to sip as you linger. I would much rather a beer, but coming from a guy who used to wear a flattop and would get his hair cut at a place called The Chop Shop, what do I know. So go on down there and getcho afro teased girl! (Or dude)
