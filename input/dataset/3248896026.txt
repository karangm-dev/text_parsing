Guy would not be famous if this was his flagship. I travel a lot and this is hands down the worst food I've ever had. The burger was so discussing I spit out the first bite and sent it all back. My second choice was a dry and tasteless turkey sandwich. How can you mess that up too?  The only thing they got right was a cheery waitress and cold beer. Great location so if you only want cold beer, all is good but if you want to eat, Stay far away.
