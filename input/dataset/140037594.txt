Love this place.I've been living in Henderson for about 6 months now, and this recent discovery is an off-strip gem that few tourists will ever discover......and that's a shame for all fans of the genre.This place is a pinball lover's paradise, and arguably houses the most comprehensive collection of pins through the ages, right up to the present, in the world.Sprinkled in for nostalgia, are a wonderful selection of 80's vids.I've been 4 times, and I love it. Simply, a no frills amusement hall, that is all substance, no fluff.5 stars.
