Bookmans is my favorite bookstore anywhere. They have a giant selection of books of every genre and that is only half the store. The store itself is huge, which is great, because usually used book stores are crammed. It is a little confusing trying to find your way around the store, but they have the store layout on some of the shelves which helps. The coolest thing about this store is that you can bring in your old media (books, music, video games, etc) and trade them for store credit or cash. If you trade for credit, they will give you a very good deal. I don't know why anyone would get cash when they have so many cool things to buy.
