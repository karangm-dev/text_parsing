I bring my family here probably every other week or so. We first found this place over a 2 months ago and it has become our favorite spot. Their ice cream is amazing. They have tons of cool options and taste bud bursting goodness to choose from. The staff is always friendly and welcoming. One of my favorites is the coconut chip. If you haven't been here I would strongly recommend getting your tail over here and get that summer but with their ice cream.
