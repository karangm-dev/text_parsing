I am thrilled I found this place! Dr. Brown and his staff are wonderful! Dr. Brown spent a lot of time on the examination and answered our many questions. I appreciated that he didn't push any unnecessary services or products on us. He found a lump on one of our cats and told us just to monitor it and bring him back in if it gets any worse, rather than opting to run a bunch of expensive tests on him immediately. We brought our cat in about a month later to have the tests done and he was very upfront about the cost and what they were testing for. I also like that they send you an appointment reminder text the day before. Their prices are reasonable and the first exam is free. This is the only place I'll be bringing my cats to from now on!
