We had breakfast here on Saturday and the burritos were good but the service was horrible.  My husband and in-laws ordered coffee and were told it was out and would be about 10 minutes.  Ok.  We waited quite a while for our food and were half way through when my husband went up for the 3rd time to ask about the coffee.  Was told it would be another 30 minutes.  When he asked for a refund, the lady rolled her eyes at him and said he had to wait in line.  It wasn't a huge amount but to wait 30 minutes for coffee?  This was my 3rd time to this location and the service hasn't been great any of the times.  I don't think we'll be going back.
