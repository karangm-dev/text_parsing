Yum! The four of us had a bit of everything and it was all great, A nice hole in the wall I would have never found without Yelp! The Kalua pork was to die for. Perfectly seasoned, moist and tender. My wifes Eggplant Pork was just as good with a totally different flavor profile. I could have eaten a whole pint of the Tuna Poke.
