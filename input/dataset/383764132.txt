I've hesitated writing my review hoping I could write a more positive one...The hotel and the Statehouse are beautiful with excellent views.  The food is hit or miss. That being said, we have had some excellent meals there.  The service is very disappointing and hasn't improved with time.  From the bartenders to the servers no one seems to own their position or seem comfortable. A few of our experiences...We were at the Statehouse for our anniversary and my parents had called to send over a couple glasses of champagne to us.  The host told them that they couldn't seem to find us.  We were one of two tables seated in the restaurant that night. They could have found us if they had tried.  Also, my husbands steak was horrible, shouldn't have been served. We were in the bar another night with 5 bartenders behind the bar discussing who should go home since it was a slow night.  As the only two in the bar we sat listening with empty drinks.A couple friends and I stopped in for drinks and appetizers after the homecoming game.  Yes, it was busy and yes, they knew they would have a huge crowd due to the after party they were hosting. But, they all seemed flustered and irritated. It took at least 20 minutes for someone to acknowledge us.  We asked about the wine and she said she didn't know because it was her first week.  I knew for a fact it wasn't her first week. I hope the  assumption isn't that everyone is a one time customer due to the fact that it's a hotel and people come and go. But, that's how we felt.  I could go on...It's such a beautiful hotel and restaurant but the service does not live up the standards that you should expect to experience in a place like this.  I really do hope they can figure it out and turn things around.  Not sure how many more chances we will give.
