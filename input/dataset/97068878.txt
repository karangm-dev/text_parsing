If I could cuss on here and not have my review erased by a moderator I would. This place is over priced. The famous bedazzled lollipops are defective and the refills don't fit. Tried to bring it back for my daughter and they wanted a receipt. I just wanted them to exchange it for a local 11 yr old without driving back to summerlin and looking for the receipt. This place has ridiculous prices on everything.
