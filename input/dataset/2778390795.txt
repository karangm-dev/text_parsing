My dog loves camp.  She is ready at the door when it's camp day.  The camp counselors are friendly and you can tell they enjoy working with the dogs.  We have a high energy German Shepherd, she gets to run and socialize with other dogs and bark and go play.  When she comes home she is excited and barks telling us about her day then comes the plop - she is worn out.
