Went there for late breakfast. Place was small but very clean. Choice was limited to Taiwanese style crepe rolls and Malaysian style breakfast. I had the chicken curry with roti chanai which was very tasty and portion was large and price was excellent compared to other Malaysian restaurants I have  been to. We also had the signature breakfast sandwich that was very tasty and prepared fresh. Hong Kong style milk tea was also good. If they could have froth up the milk ,it would have been a great cup of Teh Tarik. I think there is room for satay on their menu since they already use charcoal grill for their toasts. It is a good place for a quick bite for sure. Good service great food at a very reasonable price. I hope to return to sample the bah kut teh among other foods.
