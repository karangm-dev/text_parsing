The rooms are of course not 5 star status but you get what you pay for. It has the typical hotel beds and complimentary shampoos. The biggest reason I can not stand this place is their service is awful in the register's table. I understand I am an 18 year old in Las Vegas and I am not even allowed to rent out a room, but if you are going to book a high school level event then expect to have under aged customers. Just because I am young, it doesn't mean you have the right to not treat me like a customer. This place needs new employees for the front desk because they obviously don't have matters. I was in line for a key and they took over 10 minutes to get to the desk BUT, they let the adults behind us go before us. I was very angry at this. Don't accept bookings for a high school event if you are not going to treat the younger customers with respect. When I am 21 , I am surely not coming here again.
