One of my favorite places. The Nutella mocha is something I dream about. The New Mexico burrito is bomb - the salsa pairs perfectly with the flavors of the burrito. I also adore the OMG sandwich. The staff are always friendly even though they work in a tight space and are often very busy.This is also a great place to get some work done. My old podcast was born here and my partner and I spent countless hours getting work done on it. We also love to meet up for relaxed breakfast and lunch here. Great music. Great vibe. Great place. Oh, and they have the trippiest bathroom in Phoenix.
