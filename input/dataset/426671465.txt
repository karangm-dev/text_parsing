I've hated this place since it was a BP.  And even though the name has changed, nothing else has.This place is by far the worst of the worse.  This particular one is located at a very busy intersection where five roads meet.  So just picture that when attempting to enter/exit this place.  And to speak of the overcrowding of this tiny lot isn't even worth it.  The tiny store that goes along with this place is as much of a joke as you can imagine.  They have attempted to shove as much as they could in here to make it look like a typical GetGo.  Right down to the ATM.  Save your time and drive a few more miles to a different gas station, you'll surely save a headache by doing so.
