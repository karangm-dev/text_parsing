I normally don't have high expectations for Walmarts, but this place even failed to meet those.  The biggest complaint:  why are so many items, most of which are out in the open at other Walmarts, in locked cases?  I saw $0.97 shave cream in a locked case.  I had to wait a ridiculous amount of time just to get a $8.75 item (I can't see nose-hair clippers being a big shop lifting item).  This Walmart is near Mountains Edge.  I have a feeling shoplifting isn't an issue for stores in this area.  The parking lot is rather small for a full-sized Walmart.  Otherwise the place, being new, is clean and semi-well organized.  I didn't buy any meat, but produce and dairy were fine.  Hopefully they'll pull their heads out and get rid of some of the locked cases, or at least make a more appropriate choice as to what should be put in those cases.
