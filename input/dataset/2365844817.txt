I am confused, we bought a Groupon for this restaurant based on the reviews. What I ate had nothing in common with the reviews! I started with a cup of tomato bisque soup that was good, very tasty in fact. My friend had the capri salad which was good. My main course was the papperdelle pasta, I know it's one of the signature dishes. My pasta was so hard, the sauce was ok (not to die for), but the pasta was thick and hard. Serious I cook pasta at home and I never would have served this! My friend is a vegetarian, there were no pasta choices for her. She asked for spaghetti or something like it with a vodka sauce. Her's was not good either. It was shiny with oil or butter and way over salted. We got a desert to split and it was good. I don't know if it was an off night for this restaurant (it was a Monday) or what the problem was but based on what I ate I wouldn't go there again. Both of us barely touched our entree's and left it behind! No to go with that mess!
