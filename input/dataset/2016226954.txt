We bought six Frys chocolate bars this past weekend. When I opened them they had a white film on them and the filling had chrystalized. Yuck! Looked at the 'best before' date (too late, i know!) and it was August 2012. We bought them on October 6, 2012. Are you telling me that no one has checked the stock in 2 months?? We will not be returning. If you do visit, be sure to check the expiry dates BEFORE you purchase.
