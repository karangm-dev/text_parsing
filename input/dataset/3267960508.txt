Today is co-workers 5 years anniversary and my company decided it wanted to get him an ice cream cake. EVERY single cake in the display case was damaged. I picked the one that had the least bit frosting on the package and when I opened it...the state of the cake was even worse. $21 dollars these people charge for what looks like a toddler decorated it.  Your store Baker should be ashamed of themselves for putting such garbage out there for the public to buy. Since this was a last minute buy I really had no choice but to purchase. I have officially learned from my mistake.
