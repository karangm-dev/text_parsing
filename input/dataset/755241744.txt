Fantastic thin crust.  For sure my top 5 ever.  Being a Chicago native, I'm a pizza snob and very picky.  Always hard to find great pizza out west.  The owner Angelo is very personable and knows his stuff.   Good customer service in this take-out pizza parlor.   Highly recommended.  Can't wait to try the stuffed/deep dish.
