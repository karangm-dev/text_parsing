I love Southview, and I don't think I'd ever say I love a dentists' office.Every member of the staff is extremely friendly and courteous. No matter what time of day I am there everyone is (or pretends to be) in the best mood ever. Very professional, very clean and modern, even relaxing!Everyone was upfront with pricing, they wanted to make me feel as comfortable as possible (massage options in the chair? tvs above you? headphones for the tv? yes please!), and even though I know they're churning through patients, I never feel rushed out the door if I have questions or concerns. After my initial consultation there I've had my teeth cleaned, old fillings repaired, and even some new cavities filled. They use a three-part numbing process so I've never had issues with pain. My only complaint is sometimes, especially towards the end of the year, appointments are hard to book - but that's kind of how it goes most places. Definitely recommend them!
