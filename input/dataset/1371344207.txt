Don't do it unless you are in it for the crab legs. Everything tasted like dorm cafeteria food. Turkey was lifeless. Salad bar was equivalent with the sizzler. Nothing tasted as it should. Good variety but very little is edible. Even the desserts looked good but tasted like nothing (how do you birch dessert??!!). Stale and tired and not with $45/person.
