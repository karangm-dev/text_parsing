My friend and I had a night out decided to try this place. OMG we had the most amazing dinner and drinks. Compliments to the chef!! We had the Milanese antipasta. And the  Cannelloni to die for. We also had the martini. We were so pleased with the waiter"Jordan" and the entire staff from start to end. We will be back next time we're in Vegas!!!
