PROS: the store is clean and the staff are friendly. Location, they're right next to Nordstrom Rack, and parking is a breeze. CONS: I have been shopping consignment/thrift for 15 years and perhaps I've gotten too picky about quality and selection. The store is small and there is not much to choose from, especially in sizes larger than 8. The purse selection is nice but the prices are higher than eBay. Likewise, the prices are very high compared to other Scottsdale resale shops.
