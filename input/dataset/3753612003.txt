Beware of this business!  We had a Groupon for a haircut for my wife.  When we arrived in Las Vegas, we called and were told there were no appointments for four days.  Well, we were leaving in four days.  A visit to her shop proved fruitless.  She wasn't there and when another hairdresser called her, she again said no appointments and refused to give the business to the other hairdresser.  Bad experience to say the least!
