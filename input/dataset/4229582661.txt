The dinner service is so slow that it almost felt like a joke. We waited almost 45 minutes to have OUR ORDER TAKEN?? This meal lasted like 3.5 hours which is absurd considering the restaurant was virtually empty. It didn't help that our waiter kept trying to make jokes about it, playing it off like "oh don't worry it'll be worth it." That doesn't help when I'm S T A R V I N G !! Didn't really enjoy the lamb tagine. I thought it was on the bland side and def needed the spiced amped up threefold. Breakfast was another story. The service was quick and my french toast donut was tasty and evenly balanced, with a great maple syrup flavor (although I was unclear about what the "donut" component was supposed to be...)
