We used them about a year ago, but it's about time I leave them a great review. Beat other estimates, some by half! Excellent customer service, quick, and most importantly- they put the seams in the best places. They have a scrap yard, perfect for bathrooms and I plan on using them next year for bathroom remodels on a budget!
