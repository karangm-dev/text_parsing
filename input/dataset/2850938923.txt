Quick service, nice crew, fairly priced. Went in to have a headlight changed. I was having difficulty doing it on my own due to the awkward design of the light placement. Even had a couple friends try and they failed as well. I called Hansen's shop and they told me I could come right in. I believe the gentleman that helped me was named John. Took him 5 seconds to pull the headlight out. Turned out I needed a new socket as well because the original had melted. They were able to get a new one put in within 20 minutes. It was great! Good to have both headlights back. Definitely will go back when the other one fails
