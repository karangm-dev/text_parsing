It's only getting one star because you must give it at least one. Very simply, I ordered 2 chicken taco's they failed to put ANY chicken on either of them them. $8.00 for 2 tacos NO sides and NO chicken.They went right in the garbage. Save some money, even Taco Bell is better.The service was horrible, the girl working the evening of 03/0716, has NO knowledge of the menu, apparently she has no training.I will NEVER go there again and you shouldn't waste your money at this place either. There are plenty of other places in Downtown Summerlin.
