This was my 1st time going to the eye doctor. I saw Ka-Yan Sandi Cheung, O.D.  and she was great. She's very friendly and got me the perfect prescription for me. I would recommend this office to my family and friends. The staff is so nice and caring. They are very professional and friendly. This will be my eye doctor forever! Keep up your great service, you guys are awesome!!!
