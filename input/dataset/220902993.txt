This is far and away the tastiest diner breakfast that I've ever had in Pittsburgh. Delicious pancakes, eggs, and French toast on my plate and my family also had the veggie and Ionian omelette and loved it all. Great coffee, wasn't over crowded and the staff were friendly and efficient. Highly recommend!
