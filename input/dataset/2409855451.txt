Odd Seoul is a Koren snack bar on Ossington. It's popular; we dropped in around 7:00 on a recent weeknight and had to grab a beer up the street while we waited for half an hour. The wait was worth it. A bulgogi cheese steak and the "loosey" burger were delicious and fast food-esque, and were only $5 each. Tempura shrimp were great too. My wife was a big fan of the wings; I thought they were a little over-breaded and over-sauced. The pork belly and kimchi fried rice was good but not as delicious as the snackier part of the menu. Buffalo tofu was perfectly crispy and nailed the taste of classic buffalo wings.The room is more welcoming than sister restaurant Hanmoto, but the food is not quite as good. While not every dish was a hit, the price pushes this over the top for me. We got more food than we could eat, plus three drinks, for $80. That's hard to beat.
