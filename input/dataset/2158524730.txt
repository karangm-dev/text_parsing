I visited The Barber of Choix recently and was very impressed. I got a shave and a haircut. I had never had a straight razor shave and the experience is great. It's very much like the old-style shave you see in movies with the relaxing chair, the hot towel, the mug shave-cream, the straight razor and then the after shave. The whole experience was very relaxing and fun. I would definitely recommend it.
