Very unimpressed with this location. I walked in and was promptly greeted, which was nice. I asked the girl if they carried insulated backpacks, so I could pack lunch when I go hiking, etc. She didn't understand what I was asking for, but pointed me in the direction of where she "thought" they would be and said she would call an associate from that department to come help me. I stood in the section for nearly 10 minutes and no one ever came to help me. I tried looking for other employees, but could not find one. I went to leave the store and the girl was talking to another employee, she saw me and instantly realized she had "forgotten" to call the employee but offered to call them now. Is this what customer service is coming to? Employees leaning against counters gossiping while customers are left unattended? Will not come back and would not recommend anyone to go their for their outdoor needs.
