I received a book of coupons as a gift so I went today for a "free" car wash - and that is what it was worth. If I hadn't had another appointment I would have gone back and made them do it over. Glass was still dirty, open the passenger door and the sill still had mud, the wheel wells are filthy and they couldn't even put the floor mats back down correctly. I will avoid this place until they get some competent management.
