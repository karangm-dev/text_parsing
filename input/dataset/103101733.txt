A service company doesn't get any better than Dukes of Air. We came home on a Sunday afternoon to find our up-stairs A/C off and the temperature climbing. I called Dukes at 1PM, they had someone at our house at 2:15 and the the A/C was back up and running within an hour. Not only was the service done quickly, but they walked us through every step of the process - making sure we understood what was wrong with the system and what was normal wear on a 15 year old system.Excellent local company.
