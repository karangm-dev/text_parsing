Never again!  I have been ordering take-out and eating here for many years and it used to be ok for the price but the last 3 times we have eaten here it was absolutley horrible.  My husband and I and 2 children went inside to eat where they stuck us at a table in the back corner where the walls were greasy and filthy.  My husband would just assume not eating it and leaving but I am a little more forward and expect good food when I pay to go out so I went to the owner that usually stands in front of the restaurant and let her know very discretly and  nicely that all 4 of us were unhappy with the quality of food. She then told me that there is NO WAY that I could be unhappy because her food is the best and always fresh.  She very loudly walked to our table and stuck her hands in my sons chicken fried rice and ate it....agreed it was a little dry and would only give us our money back for the 2 cheapest meals although she could clearly see all 4 dishes were untouched.....UNACCEPTABLE and so so UNPROFESSIONAL!!!! Fried rice tasted like it had been sitting there for 10 days and you couldn't taste the difference in my husbands beef with garlic sauce and my hunan chicken.  The chicken wings use to be one of the highlights of going here. NOT ANYMORE.  I read today in south charlotte weekly that they recieved a grade of 90.  They also pulled out the booth right in front of us and were vaccuming as we were trying to taste our food.  VERY rude people and DISGUISTING food.
