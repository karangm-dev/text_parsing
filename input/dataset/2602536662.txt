You don't need to call for reservations because they don't even care. When you have reservations for 10:00 am, and you have been wait for half an hour, then you ask them how long we have to wait still, the answer for them is " I don't know". I WILL NEVER COME AND WILL TELL ALL MY FRIENDS DON'T COME THIS SHITY RESTAURANT.
