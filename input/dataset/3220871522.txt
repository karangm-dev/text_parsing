The WORST!First of all let me say I felt like I read every possible article I could find of the best buffets in Vegas because I was so excited to try a Las Vegas buffet. I am not a "buffet" person so I wanted to make sure that I made the right decision for the ONE time I was actually excited to go to one. Ugh, I couldn't have been more disappointed. From the moment we walked in all my expectations were crushed. First of all, the buffet hall (yes it's a hall) smelled weird. I couldn't place it but it just must have been all of the food smells mixing together and it was not appetizing. The crab lags were cold and I mean FREEZING. But if you happened to see someone else do it (because here wasn't a sign) you could take them to the Taco station to have them heated (?) But even then they were average. And that was the problem across the board, everything was just average. Tacos had very little flavor, every pasta was a greasy creamed based mess, the jumbo shrimp were average size and not jumbo at all. I read about the pesto mashed potatoes, but they were a let down too. At the end of the day I felt like a was at a Golden Corral and not the Bellagio. I read some of the bad reviews before we went and thought that those people were just being dramatic and it couldn't possibly be as bad as they wrote and I was wrong. I will never go back.
