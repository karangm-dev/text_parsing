First impressions were bad..the hallways look like they hadn't been vacuumed in days.  The door was all banged up and paint was chipped.   The "fitness center" had one treadmill and one stair machine only.   When we opened the door we  saw stains on the carpet and a stain on our sheets.   Our room was for four with two beds and only had two towels.  If we hadn't gotten in late after 14 hours on the road we would have left. Would not recommend this place
