Always looking for a great AYCE sushi place.  But this did not live up to others we have been too.  Went at lunch time.  Not busy at all.  Could be the location.  As soon as you walk in, you hit a wall of "fried oil" smell.  Our clothes wreaked of it when we got home.  They need a super ventilation system put in there.  Sushi is very bland.  Spicy tuna, not spicy at all.  We tried several rolls.  The spider roll was good, but not "I have to go back for more" good.   Very small pieces of shrimp and yellow tail sushi.  Nothing exciting.  We have had better tasting and fresher sushi at other places.  Five star reviews must be coming from first time sushi eaters?  They have no idea how to compare it to the good stuff.  Friendly staff, though.  Oh, and we found odd/funny - at the top of the menu, before you even order - it says 45 minutes for AYCE.  In other words, be prepared to eat fast.  They pretty much won't let you eat more after that point, LOL....I've never been rushed at our other sushi joint.
