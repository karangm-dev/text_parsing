Prior to this review I've stayed at this hotel one other time. I flew into Phoenix expecting to stay at this particular Hilton Garden Inn because my previous stay was pleasant minus the construction that was occurring. I booked the hotel through a third party, which means that the hotel was already paid for prior to check-in. When I arrive to the hotel and check-in at the front desk agent Jomah decided to run my card four times after I'd already explained to her that the hotel was prepaid. Jomah decides to call all of her managers on duty along with other front desk agents (so now there are 5 people behind the counter) telling me that I didn't pay and I need to call the third party to cancel. I call the third party and sit on the phone for 3 hours while they go back and forth with the hotel. Jason decides to tell the third party "can't you just book them some where else?" They cancelled the reservation without me giving them permission to do so. Moral of the story: staff is untrained, racist, rude and lazy. Save your money or spend a little extra and go else where.
