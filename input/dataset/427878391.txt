Great experience and since I bought my dress I keep recommending this place to everyone! Kalina was super helpful and experience, she understood right away the style I wanted and presented me with few dresses that match it: the second one was it! I tried some more on but that second dress was the one I loved! I would have never imagined to go for a brand but I did and for a price that was way less than any more known cheaper places. Moreover, they helped me in do the fitting at the last moment and everything worked perfectly (I live in California and I came back for my second fitting just three days before my wedding!) The tailor was excellent in her work and I trusted her completely!
