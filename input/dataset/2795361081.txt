I've had several treatments at Sol Touch Massage, and there's a reason why reviewers are giving this place 5 stars! Jeremy at the front desk is awesome, and John (who studied kinesiology, or how the body moves, in college) knows every single muscle group, joint, and tendon in the body. Overhead is kept low, which keeps prices reasonable -- another reason I return again and again. Whether you need a relaxing massage, or a treatment to iron out specific kinks, Sol Touch Massage is the place.
