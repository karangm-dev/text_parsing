Had to take an elevator up, then another elevator back down to get to our room.  We were in the not yet remodeled area.  Carpet in the hall & room were gross.  The chair was filthy.  There was hair & a piece of a popcorn kernel on the bathoom counter.  The only thing clean were the sheets.  Luckily, they were immaculate!  That was the only plus about this place.  Including the resort fee, we paid $44 for one night. Not worth it. In my opinion, they should close off this area until the reno is complete.  It is appalling!
