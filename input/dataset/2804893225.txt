Love this place! Very high quality, if not pricey food. The reason for this 5 star review is for their happy hour. The prime burger is one of my favorite burgers in town & during happy hour it's only $7 for this quality bacon burger. You get your choice of cheese ( I get blue) & a side of fries. If your a burger lover check out one of the best deals in Vegas.
