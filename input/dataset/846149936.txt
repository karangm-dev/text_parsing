mehhhh. could be better.#1.....do you really need 20 employees for 10 customers? I mean, really?! seemed a little over crowded in the back to me. it was nice having good, friendly, fast service. just seemed a little overbearing.#2.....vegetarians opinion on the veggie burger? boca patties are much better than "veggie" patties. those things are nasty! change that and i will come back for sure. otherwise, i will have to think about it. Though I must say I do appreciate you having a vegetarian option and allowing the substitute on any burger! :)#3.....The fries need a little work.Thank you, drive thru, please come again! (if you change to boca patties!) ;)
