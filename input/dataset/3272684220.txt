I just received one of the best massages I've ever had at the Tempe Massage Envy on Elliot. Kristi gave me an excellent deep tissue massage - painful and relaxing; and I felt great afterwards too. I've had many different massage therapists at this location and most of them are terrific, but I'd highly recommend Kristi as one of the best.
