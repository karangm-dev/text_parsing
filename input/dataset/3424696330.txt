Walked in on a Friday night so we figured we would have to wait a bit to be seated and served, we waited for 20 minutes before we sat down when there was only one large party in the the resturaunt, once sat we waited 45 minutes before we left, not even a drink order or interaction with a server, we finaly decided to walk out and never come back to this resturaunt again, rude waiters, understaffed, and a very unpleasant experience
