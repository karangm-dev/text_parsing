I came the first time for a YEE event and came back another time after time after that and this place is really great.The restaurant is located on Eastern Avenue right by 215 which means that it is very easy to get there. Parking will also be easy. There are plenty of spots around the restaurant and it was never overly busy both times I was there.Service is very good and so is the food. Make sure to try some of their sushi and the Funkler for dessert as I feel like this is one of their specialties. Good thing to know about this place is that they offer an AYCE option as well as a happy hour everyday from 3-6 pm.In the end, I would definitely recommend this place as a must try in the Las Vegas area if you like sushi. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!
