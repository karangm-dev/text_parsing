This store is amazing and has so many great dresses and jewelry to rent. I was in town for a conference and of course also managed to plan some nights out. I went to RTR and had the pleasure of meeting and working with Alyssa. She is incredible and recommended so many great dresses and accessories. She is so talented in knowing what styles work for your body type. Also, she is good at styling the dress with the right jewelry and bag. I tried to go overboard on the jewelry and her editorial eye convinced me to tone it down. I ended up visiting and renting from the store for 3 different nights out. She really is talented. I also want to thank Whitney. You should go visit this store if you are looking for a princess experience and ask for Alyssa.
