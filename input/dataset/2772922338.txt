I came here everyday for two weeks and most times I would get the lamb plate because it is just SO DELICIOUS and I would crave it all the time! The potatoes with garlic sauce are so good, the hummus is creamy, and the lamb shawarma oh my goodness it is the best thing I've ever had. Chicken shawarma is delicious...but that lamb is a whole n'other level; a mix of gamey and tender. On top of that they drown your plate with garlic sauce, hot sauce, and this very interesting sweet sauce (I don't remember the name...'Armenian sweet sauce' maybe) which completes the whole meal. Thinking about that sauce drizzled on top of the lamb shawarma is making me so hungry right now. And I don't know where else serves this sauce/lamb shawarma. Also their falafels are handmade and fried on the spot and is not dry at all. I don't normally like falafel (since all the ones I've had before were dry and generally sucked)...but shawarma knight has changed my mind. GO HERE!
