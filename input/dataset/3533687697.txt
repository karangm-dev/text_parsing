I liked this place so much that I came back twice during my two week business trip in Phoenix!  The first time was with my co-worker, and the second time, I went on my own.  I'm a little unsettled venturing out to restaurants/bars by myself, but sitting at the bar and ordering during my solo visit was a great experience.  The bartender was very welcoming and made me feel less self-conscious that I was drinking and eating by myself among the 20, 30-somethings all around out for their happy hour festivities.  I think the biggest appeal for me was that this place reminds me of a lot of the places I loved when living in Austin.  It's a charming house converted to a restaurant/bar with a really nice outdoor patio area.  Both times, I had Sophie's Salad.  Delicious!  I also tried the Salty Hog, which is a great choice if you're looking for a refreshing mixed drink (and you're a bacon lover).  I will definitely go back if I'm out in Phoenix again!
