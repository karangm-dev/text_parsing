What a joke. I updated my home address which removed a delivery hold I had (unbeknownst to me at the time). So they delivered the 3 bottles on the next scheduled delivery as per the Costco plan without my knowledge. I called them to pick up the bottles and I'd put 4 empties I had along with the 3 fulls. They pick up the bottles 10 days later (on Aug 1st) but they still haven't issued the credit. I've been told 3 times now they have to email the local manager to verify the bottles were picked up. What???And they won't give me the phone number to the local office. They if you find it online that's fine but we won't give it out. What the hell???In the meantime, the next bill shows a $3.17 fuel surcharge for picking up the bottles. They screwed up and they want to pass the surcharge on to me?  Ridiculous.This is one of the few times Costco has fallen way short with a vendor providing horrible service.If you want to avoid the headache and the heartache stay away from Sparkletts and just refill a couple bottles at Albertsons or Smith's.
