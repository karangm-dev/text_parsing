I had to stay one night in Vegas on business, and I booked a room at Mandalay Bay.  I paid for it in advance.  When I got there to check in, they said they had "upgraded" me to THE Hotel.  They had already assigned me to a particular room, and they gave me the key.  I took the key and walked back through the casino to the hotel entrance,When I got to the room, I saw that it was really tiny by Vegas standards.  It was nice enough, but when I went to plug in my laptop I saw that there was no desk, no chair, and astonishingly, there was only one electrical outlet in the whole room!!  I was there on business, and I couldn't plug in.  I was too tired to go back downstairs and change rooms, so I stayed - it was only one night after all.  But I've never actually seen a hotel room before that didn't have a desk, a chair, or electricity.  All it was was a room with a bed.  It did have two bathrobes and two sets of slippers - but nowhere to sit down.  Business travelers beware!
