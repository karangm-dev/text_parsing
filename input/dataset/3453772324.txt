Since it's called "Number One," I was expecting to be impressed. This was my first experience with pho and if this is indeed number one, pho must be a very overrated food. The beef and pork seemed to be low quality. Most of the restaurant surfaces were covered in grime like one would find above an oven. The floors were sticky all over. The service was friendly but overall the experience was a disappointment. It takes more than an important name to make a restaurant number one.
