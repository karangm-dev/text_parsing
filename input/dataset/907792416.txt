Went here on a Thursday evening to enjoy drinks with a couple of friends. It was my first time here so of course I want to check the entire place out to see what all they had to offer. This was very difficult to do considering every corner I turned there was another employee asking me if I was part of "the party". Every part of the place was reserved expect the outside bar. Sorry but I find this very annoying, we came to play games an hang out but was unable to do so due to the ENTIRE place being reserved! I think they should have at least posted a sign on the front door warning customers that they were booked for the evening. Due to this very bad first experience I will probably never go back.
