I use the grocery pick up here and it's the worst! They have forgotten to send items (that I paid for) 6 or 7 times total. Every time I call and inform them of their mistake they apologize, explain how they don't know what happened, and ask if I can go pick up the forgotten item. Really!? I use this service as a convenience and now I have to go back and pick up a 2nd time because of their employees mistakes!? They could at least deliver it. So here I go back to the store because I need the item and they give me a mini wal mart tote, I know have at least 5 of those.  I have continued shopping there because it is nice to pick up groceries and I think maybe they will have all my items. Not the case! I order the groceries and my wife picks up so she doesn't know everything on the list and they don't even give a receipt. I called the other day furious and the lady I spoke with said the grocery team was not there and she would pass the message along to the manager. I have heard nothing and this was Tuesday. It is now Saturday. I will not be using them anymore and I suggest none of you do unless you would like to experience all of the loveliness above.
