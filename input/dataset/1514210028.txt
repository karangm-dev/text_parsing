You win some. You lose some. I walked into this one expecting it to be an event similar to Taste of Summer, which was held in the Flats a couple months ago. Well, you know what they say about high expectations... The problem here is that I'm 5'1 and large crowds of people that literally like to just stand still make my blood pressure rise. I can't see why you're standing still, all I know is that you're not planning on moving and now I'm stuck behind you. It's absolutely unnerving.The food was meh. Lots of meat on sticks, lots of suspicious bubble teas, lots of steamed buns and noodle/rice dishes. But I'll be honest, the crowd situation turned me off so much that I lost my appetite to even want to search out something desirable. I couldn't get out of there soon enough.  Long story short - if you don't mind being uncomfortably close to humans you've never met, you'll probably enjoy yourself.
