It tastes like Burrito Boyz.   It may not the most authentic (but what do i know)  but its sure tasty. They have flavours like spicy pulled prok and mango chicken along with the usual toppings and sauces. Its grilled to a crispy crunchy wrap and served in the paper bag. There is limited seating here and gets busy after 12pm. Its an alternative to burgers.
