I was so excited to find Pop Drinks!! Their "Palms" soda is just what I need for a long day, coupled with a chilled sugar cookie and it's a heavenly treat! I love that I can get my kids a popcorn instead of a cookie when they have earned a treat but I don't want to give them sugar. We love it here!!
