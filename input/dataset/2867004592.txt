Very small men's section with very few fashionable items.   Coming from Chicago this is really sort of dingy and small overall.  Understaffed, there was nobody to help out or do dressing room assistance even on a not so busy day.  Old feeling store with poor lighting.  Surely there're better stores in the city.
