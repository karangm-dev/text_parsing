Their web site lured me in, impressive as it is... "Largest service fleet in the area... etc. etc." They said they could fix our LG washer, but then they didn't stock the parts, had to special order them, and when the new parts were installed, the machine didn't work.Well, they get ZERO stars for not fixing the washer. They get ZERO stars for charging us for a service call when they had no real solution. They were kind enough to remove the new (bad? wrong?) parts, and to refund our money for them. But then, THEY GAVE UP, blaming LG for being a crappy company, and suggesting we buy a Whirlpool. Well, maybe that's true, and probably a good suggestion, although this $900 washer was highly recommended by Consumer Reports about five years ago, when we bought it. You would think if they are authorized to repair LG washers, that they would do a better job at customer service. Now I have to call LG, file a complaint, and find a *real* solution provider. This is a real *hassle* I don't need right now. Whatever happened to the old, "We'll get it right, or you don't pay a dime!" guarantee? Does anyone still offer that in the Appliance Repair category? Everyone wants a minimum charge for a service call, whether they actually do anything or not. What a sour taste that leaves in the customer's mind! Take the money and run is no way to go through life, folks!
