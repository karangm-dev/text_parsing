Wow, what a disappointment!We often find Yelp to be a great tool in aiding our search for good places to visit.  Well, this time the Yelp reviews led us astray!One of our dinners was very, very salty.  Yuk.We decided to split the salad with the poached egg on it -- thought that would be interesting.  It was -- the egg was RAW.  We questioned the waitress about it and she explained that ti was poached. Well, yea, it was, sorta.  But does poached mean there would be uncooked egg white and yolk running over the salad?  A fellow, seemingly "in authority" stopped by with the full expectation that we would lavish complements on the establishment.  We also told him about the problem.  No response -- he moved on.  The beer list was minimal and undistinguished and the wine list was extensive.  Both wine and beer were v-e-r-y expensive for an undistinguished  little joint in a strip plaza.  I have never paid $6 for a 12oz bottle of beer before.  So, here's our score ...Food quality:  2.5 - 3Food quantity:  3Food value:  3Beverage variety: 2Beverage value: 1Service: 2Ambiance: 3Would we return?  Not a chance!  We'll leave it to others to heap praise on this place -- while we will avoid it and advise others to do so as well.
