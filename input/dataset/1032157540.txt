This place. I had heard about it being a staple in the Vegas community when I lived here last year, and I'm glad I got to try it! The food was incredible and GREAT portions for the price. The decor is perfectly Vegas. The lounge was beautiful! The place was packed but I called ahead for.my Party of 14 and we were seated 20 minutes after arrival.Our table's favorite dish next to the giant pancakes was the Sin City BLT that came with an overeasy egg and pesto sauce. Please try this place on your next trip!
