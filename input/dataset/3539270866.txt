Halibut House is great.  I am not sure why the reviews aren't higher, but the owner/manager of this franchise (Gary) is extremely personable as is the female that also works there.  I haven't spoken to anyone else.  The establishment is new, and clean and the service is quick.  The Fish and Chips are great.  The batter is light and airy, and the chips are pretty good.  I'm guessing the incident of not double frying was limited to one day.  I've been there at least 3 times and the fries have been on point.  Overall a good place to eat.
