This was indeed up there in the top three meals I have ever had. The service was exceptional and the food  was incredible. My friend had short ribs and I had the filet.  The calamari appetizer was the best we have ever had. The beet salad was quite unique. I will definitely be returning here. Absolutely superb in every way!
