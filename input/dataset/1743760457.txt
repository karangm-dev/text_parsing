From the moment we walked in I knew this was going to be an amazing experience. I met my consultant (Donna) the front and she took us back to our private room. She asked me a lot of questions to get to know me and my style, and I loved that. We got to go out to the floor and looked through all of the dresses and chose the ones for my to try on. The dressing room was large (which I LOVED) and my consultant made me feel so comfortable. I didn't feel pressure from anyone at the boutique and found the dress of my dreams today! I would definitely recommend Brilliant bridal and am so happy I found them during the bridal spectacular. Thank you Donna, and the rest of the Brilliant bridal team for truly making me feel like a princess.
