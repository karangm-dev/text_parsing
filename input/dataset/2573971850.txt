We just moved to the area and wanted to take the in laws out for brunch.The food here was delicious! Good old home style cooking. The biscuits and gravy were to die for, so full of thick chunks of sausage and the biscuits were huge! The cheesy hash browns were amazing. And the coffee was also very fresh and actually came in a full sized mug, not a little mini one at other restaurants.  The price was extremely reasonable for all of the food we got. My in-laws loved it and I loved it too! Will definitely be coming back for more!!
