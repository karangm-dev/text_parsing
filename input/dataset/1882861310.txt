This is real east coast pizza with fresh real ingredients. The sausage is made from scratch and the dough on the pizza is out of this world. We live in Henderson and this pizza is so good worth the trip. He does delivery to Henderson as well but we love going in. The owner is always happy to see us and it is such a great feeling knowing how he really cares about what he serves and the service. This place is wonderful. I would give it 100 stars if I could.
