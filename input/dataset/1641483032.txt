There is quite a dearth of good Indian or Pakistani restaurants in Cleveland. Since I live in Lakewood I decided to check out Namaste Indian Garden having heard decent things about it. Suffice to say, I will not be recommending this place to anyone. 1) we ordered the chicken biryani and mirchi chicken and requested it be spicy. The waiter insisted a level 2-3 was spicy enough which is what we proceeded to order. On arrival, it was bland, lacked flavor and worst of all was cold. Not luke warm, but cold. 2) I live masala dosa. And, you'd wonder how could anyone get that wrong? Well you can when you bring out a dosa that's clearly been sitting out for sometime ie soft and cold. When I complained about it to the owner, he brought us a new masala dosa but then came to our table and said to my friend - It's best not to deal with "mad" women. Nope, definitely driving all the way to Beachwood to Choolah next time I'm craving home food.
