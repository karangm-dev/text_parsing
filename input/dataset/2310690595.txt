I love fusion food and Buldogis is no different. Grabbing an American classic and giving it a Korean twist, Buldogis has become one of my favorite places. Their menu is full of unique hot dogs, all with their own combination and flavor. They also sell burgers that are HUGE and again, with unique flavor. But wait, there's more. Their fries are amazingly fresh and packed with meat and cheese.Buldogis is really too hard to describe in words. Their entire menu is one big experiment, but I can guarantee it all tastes good. The owner is the coolest guy too. He's really friendly and welcoming. This place is definitely worth a try.
