The food is decent at best, they could definitely use an updated menu or higher quality ingredients for the options already given. The main reason I am writing a review is because the service was terrible. We literally grabbed our own glasses off another table and walked over to the water fountain and got our own water because she was so slow. I wouldn't recommended people going there.
