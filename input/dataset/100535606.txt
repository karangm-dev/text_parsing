After posting a review for the wrong location, I finally updated my post for the correct place. Here it is:I agree with other reviewers. It is definitely one of the smallest Starbucks I have seen. The best option is to drive-thru. During mornings and evenings, the line starts forming outside the shop and there is hardly any place to sit inside.Worth visiting in the summer months as there is a little more outdoor seating but I would skip this location if you do not plan on driving thru.
