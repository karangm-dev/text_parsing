So I chose this place last minute b/cry family was going to pieology and I didn't want you pizza. I order a joey jr & the burrito was so big it broke the tortilla. The burrito maker grabbed another tortilla and wrapped it on top. The cashier ask the burrito maker "this is a joey jr?" Burrito maker says "yes" and the cashier goes on to charge me a regular size burrito. I reassure him that I ordered a jr and he get his manager to refund the difference. The manager seemed to not know what she was doing as 3 new customers came in before I received my refund. Moral of the story is, don't be upset at your customers for your employees mistakes!! Especially when the food is mediocre!
