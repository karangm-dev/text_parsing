Was told the ring I bought for $150 at Royal Palce was Zuni silver with inlay. Initially was happy with my purchase until I visited Storyteller Indian Store (Silverton, Co, also store in Carefree, AZ). I saw another ring I liked better and inquired if owner, David, would consider a trade and I'd pay the difference. He told me it wasn't worth what I'd paid for, that I'd been 'ripped off' as quality wasn't worth price. After reading other reviews, I guess I'm stuck with it. Do Not Shop Here!!!
