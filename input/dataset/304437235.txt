Went by for lunch had lasagna(cold and small) had to ask for sauce didn't bother with cheese too much of a hassle for person serving  me.  Veal sangwich  (tasteless) no sauce  very dry one piece of veal .Very expensive $18 with a coke won't be going back.   Lamanna's  excellent hot food and you get a lot more for less .
