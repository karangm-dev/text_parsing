They started out so great.. they were a magical store where our washer and dryer dreams came true.. great price and quick delivery and then they sank like the titanic. When we bought our dryer, we were told hey buy a cord and if its the wrong one the delivery guys will have the correct one and swap it out for you... Well this is incorrect. Per the delivery company they stopped doing that months ago. This was Friday.... Monday, try and call the store- takes 4 attempts for someone to answer and when they do, the response was only a manager can help and they are busy let me put you on hold..wait 10 minutes and call back... this time i speak with who says how sorry they are and that they will get it taken care of and get a tech out to install... Since this time, i have called probably 15-20 times, and spoke with 4 or 5 different people, including my original sales person who all assured me that this will be taken care of and made right.... 4 days later im in the same position i was on Friday. A dryer that doesn't work and and no service call to when it will be installed. Epic fail on customer service.
