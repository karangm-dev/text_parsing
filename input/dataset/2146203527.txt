So I decided to try out this spot a few friends mentioned to me. I walked in and was happy there wasn't a long line especially during lunch peak hours. It was clean, the staff was friendly and the menu options to get started were good. It's so many options I didn't know where to start, so I just got The Woodstock and added chicken. It was amazinnnng!!! The price includes any and every topping, I'm adding shrimp to my pizza next time for sure!
