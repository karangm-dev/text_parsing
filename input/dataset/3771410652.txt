This place is AWFUL. They told me they could get to my pedicure right away and had me sit down and soak my toes which sounded nice until the water never got warm and I waited 30 minutes with soggy toes before someone came to do them. The only reason I didn't get up and walk out is because my sister was already getting her nails done. Well after 30 minutes of waiting an angry man who didn't speak English and worked there came over and started filing my fingernails . Uh hi... I'm getting a pedicure. I kindly told him I was just getting a pedi and he was super annoyed and walked away and came back 10 minutes later to work in my toes. At one point he wasn't paying Attention and used that cuticle thing on my toe. Not my toe nail... my toe. The whole thing was awful. He wouldn't take the callouses off my feet and then when he finally relented he did like five swipes and then quickly painted my toes. I have callouses still and my nails weren't completely painted . Teresa there is an angel and she fixed them. But that cranky old man was awful. We all deserve a little grace so I understand a bad day... but he was beyond the point of his behavior being excusable. I was a paying client and his lack of professionalism was too much for me to ever consider returning.
