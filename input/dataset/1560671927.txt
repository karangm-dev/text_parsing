This Subway is in the Arizona Center in downtown Phoenix.  I have eaten at this particular restaurant several times and it was just regular old Subway.  There are so many better choices near by for sandwiches,  I can't seem to understand how this place can be so busy.  Subway claims to want to offer better health choices for customers, yet they regularly offer "footlong" subs that are marginally more expensive than a 6-inch sandwich.If you are looking for a decent sandwich in the area, head over to Crave (my favorite) or corner bakery.
