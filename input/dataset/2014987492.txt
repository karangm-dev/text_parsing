Ordered an Italian Sausage sandwich and a Caesar Salad, to go.  It took 30 minutes.  We placed our order at 1:14pm and received it at 1:45pm.  The Caesar was the yellow heart of the Romaine, the dressing is the same as I have in my refrigerator from Safeway.  It used to be GREAT!!  What happened?  The sandwich was so-so.  Won't be back.  Too bad, because their pizzas look great.
