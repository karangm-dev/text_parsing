I wish there was a 0 star button so I can rate this location. Fairly speaking, the tea tasted really good and rich and flavourful, but I was served by some good looking chicks that don't know what a standard customer service is. No smile, so greeting, they were chatting still while taking my order and I was there like "Hello I'm here". When I asked for recommendation they seemed extremely annoyed like they expect us to walk in knowing what drink to order at first place! They ended up barely recommending anything and I randomly picked one item and hoping for the best. They shouted my order number, only the number, I didn't even know it was for me. They should've at least said "your order number is..." Nah, only the numbers in front of my face. They also force you to buy 1 size for certain drinks that happens to be huge and cost almost $8. I wouldn't mind paying $8 if the tea tasted good and I got a good customer service. I couldn't fully put how they treated me in to words but it was overall terrible. While there's many bubble tea chains here in downtown Toronto there should be no reason for me to go back here.
