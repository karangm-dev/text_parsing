Sushi Samba is a fantastic restaurant, serving authentic and fresh seafood.The service was very good and the ambiance of this restaurant is pretty cool and hip.  But really it's about the food.  I totally agree with the tips from others on the Miso Glazed Sea Bass, that is the #1 best dish, it was amazing.  We also had lots of sushi, the Kobe beef dish with mushrooms and root veggies was super excellent also.To be honest, I don't know all the dishes we had as we let the chef decide, omikase style.  But all of it was good, or interesting and it was very satisfying.  The chefs here are excellent.  This was my best meal in Vegas in a while.I would also recommend the mixed drink Caipirinha, which was also very tasty and I had several off.I can't wait to come back.
