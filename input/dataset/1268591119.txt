Amazing food its location seems a bit daunting but totally worth it once you go inside.  It is located right next to Perth Micro Brewery and they share a beautiful tropical patio, with plenty of sprayers and shade to keep the cancer away.  We met a group of friends and ate almost everything offered on the menu, nothing was bad, they had a large enough variety for every taste and fussiness.  We had younger children with us but no problem finding them something to eat.  Portions were all plenty and then staff attentive and friendly.
