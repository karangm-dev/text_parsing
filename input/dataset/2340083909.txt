I'm really shocked this Panera is only at 2.5 at the time I'm writing this! Panera is my home away from home and where I try to get as many meals as possible when I'm traveling for work. I know the menu and trust the food, and my experience here was just as good as any other location in the many other states I've visited. Service was on par, too. Totally satisfied with this place.
