From the exterior, there is nothing unique about this place.Inside, I was seated immediately along with a friend and given menus. The salmon sashimi was disappointing, didn't taste fresh. What surprised me was the service was terrible, especially since it was a weekday and was not busy at all.The only thing that tasted half decent was the dessert which was probably store bought.I would not recommend this place to a friend.2/5
