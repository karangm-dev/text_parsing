The food is what you've come to expect.  However, the service is less than stellar.  The employees have zero sense of urgency and can't seem to make more than two meals at a time.  This causes the line to back up near the door.  This has happened to me at this location for as long as I can remember.  It would be simple to solve this problem by instilling sense of urgency in the employees. There is no reason for the lines to be the size they are at the times I am there.  If you are looking to get in and out, like the vast majority of Americans, go to the Chipotle at Southpark.  More fluid lines and smaller for the same food.  Will save you ten to 15 minutes of valuable time.
