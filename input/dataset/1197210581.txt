I went for brunch with my boyfriend this morning. The omelette I had with added mushrooms was very good. My boyfriend had the skinny and he liked it. The service was mediocre. We were seated and had to wait about 10 minutes before someone came over and asked if we were offered drinks yet. They then got our server to take our drink and food order. The check was dropped off about 3 minutes after our food was served. I hadn't even tried a bite of everything on my plate yet. Before we had even finished the meal, forks were in hand, they asked if we were done eating. It definitely felt like we were being rushed out of the restaurant.  We got to the restaurant at 11:20a and there was no wait, there was still no wait for our table 30 minutes later when we were asked if we were finished about 5 minutes after receiving our food. Yes the food was great but would I go back, no.
