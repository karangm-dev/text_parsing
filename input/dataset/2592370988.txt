The food here is fabulous. You can build your dinner by picking your pasta, sauce, and top. I had the spinach fettuccine with bolognese sauce,and eggplant parmesan for the topper. It was delicious! My three companions enjoyed their food as well. Everything is made fresh onsite including three kinds of cheesecake. It's casual but nice- you order at the register, and they bring the food to you. They don't serve wine, but we brought a bottle of wine and paid a five dollar corking fee. I'll definitely go back.
