It was edible. But not good. Delivery was par, but the pizza was lukewarm and had a chewy texture (in the tire sense, not the warm cookie sense). I'm not sure how this franchise has managed to explode recently, but they need to focus on food quality more and rapid expansion less. Get it right, then go big.
