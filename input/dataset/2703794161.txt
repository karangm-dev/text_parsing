I needed a large truck after purchasing a new set of furniture, so I went to Adens Hay Oasis, aka U-Haul, on Williamsfield.The kid behind the counter, a local cowboy (no joke), was helpful in making sure they had a truck for us the next day. I got there early the next morning before they were open. After waiting a few minutes for the 2 kids to set out the horse and pig feed (next to the chicken coop in the parking lot) outside for the day, I was helped a few minutes early and sent on my way. The truck I received was in excellent shape (for a moving truck), and actually enjoyable to drive. Returning the truck was quick and painless. Now I know where to go locally for a quick moving truck..... and also pot belly pig feed, spurs, and horse accessories.
