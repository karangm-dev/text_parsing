My niece is love Teppanyaki. Ever since their first experience they want to go every chance we get. Just so happen to be in the area of the mall and decided to go here. We were not disappointed. The chef was entertaining the girls loved every minute of it and they weren't even scared of the volcano. The portions were awesome and the service is wonderful. Liked the green tea ice tea very much. Had some surf and turf and teriyaki chicken and both are awesome. Even got the kids to try shrimp. Similar to that other place but a little bit cheaper. Portions are a little bit bigger too. ate half my meal there and still took home about the same size portion
