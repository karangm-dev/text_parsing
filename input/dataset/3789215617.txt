My wife and I arrived late in the evening or early in the morning depending on your perspective. So at 1:00 A.M I was expecting very little wait. 2.5 hours later the 1 working employee, and I would like to clarify that, when I say 1 I mean that there were 3 employees that I saw working the desk but 2 hid in the back so only one employee was actually working. Sorry, I got a little sidetracked there. So anyway I get to the desk, now 3:30A.M, and go to pick up my reservation which was supposed to be a Challenger. I was told by the clerk that they did not have a Challenger or similar model available. They attempted to put me in a Civic instead of the car I reserved and charge me the same amount. I had to argue for 30 minutes to go from a Civic to a Chrysler Town and Country minivan for the price I had already paid for a Challenger with no refunded amount. To recap, on my honeymoon, I reserved a challenger, left in a minivan. I strongly recommend anywhere but here.
