Been coming to eggworks for years even before this location opened.  Service is normally great.We were sat right behind the bench when people wait to be seated. There is a wide opening in the wall there between the bench and our table. One customer who was waiting kept coughing without covering her mouth, right into my bf face. So we asked to move. We told the hostess and just waited a minute to find an open table. They didn't make a big deal about it and were nice about it.....except for our server. He wanted us to move to a table nearby but we waited on the hostess to tell us where to go since we didn't wanna mess up any seating arrangement with the other people waiting.  He seemed mad we moved and we even saw him talking to our new server Natalia about us and shaking his head. Look, no one likes some random stranger coughing near their face right before they eat. Either get a glass partitioner or some kind of divider at the wall or don't seat people there so close to people waiting. As for the server he should of had some kind of understanding why we moved. Nothing personal.
