We decided to go out on a nice date with another couple and were disappointed in the place overall...Guess I was expecting something more classy.  Don't get me wrong the steaks were good but not WOW by any means.  We got sold on one of the specials which was a 37ounce steak which they suggested we could split...Well when it came it was about 10 ounces of steak and 27ounces of bone.  So bad that the bone was twice as long as the plate.  Not to mention that it was way more expensive...  Sorry guess Im not use to the old bait and switch at  a high end steak house...  Should have stuck with the regular menu.... Needless to say we left a little hungry and this should never happen at a SteakHouse...
