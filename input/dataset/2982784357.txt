Went there for lunch yesterday. We ordered our food to-go beforehand. We were told it would take 15-20 minutes. No problem. We left about 15 minutes after the order was placed. Once we got there, we waited another 45 minutes! So much for our lunch hour! it wasn't like the restaurant was busy (we looked in the restaurant & bar area as we went to & from work). It is a good thing we just work across the street. Would we do carry-on from them again? I doubt it. I think this happened to me once before, a few years ago....Food review - my friend's salad was lacking some of the ingredients listed in the description. And, my steak wrap was very dry. And, they screwed up my order.
