Definitely never going there again. Very in-authentic Indian catering to the folks who have probably never tried Indian food. Kanji lemonade - not only had no kanji, it had no fresh squeezed lemon. it was just Hi-c. Samosas were soooo bland and made from tortilla. Garlic naan was cold, burnt - how can one mess up on naan?!  Ordered spicy version of saag paneer - same bland taste as other mild dishes. Achar was dry and old. All in all - complete waste of money, time and taste.
