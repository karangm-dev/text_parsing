You would never know it by the outside (or especially the inside) but this is amazing Chinese food! I have been to this place countless times over the years and it is always consistently awesome.  The sesame chicken, chicken and broccoli, cashew chicken and chow mein are all great, as are their egg rolls.  Great food at a very good (read: cheap!) price.
