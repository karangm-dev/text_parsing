The location was amazing and the restaurant looks great but the biggest problem that this place has is the wait time and the service by far. For me I was not impressed with the food as well. I had ordered a coffee and cheese cake slice and I only received the coffee. I will not be coming back at all. I was so disappointed with this restaurant/ bakery. Oh I should mention that I can receive my bill faster than I can receive my cheese cake.
