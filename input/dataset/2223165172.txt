Spectacular exhibits.  The Hall of Architecture is one of my favorites.  The  holiday Tree Display is fun with the six 20 feet trees decorated in different themes each year.  Some great art work including Monet...one of my favorites.  Many other great pieces of art are in the collection at the museum  Also, some newer or rediscoved art is on display.The museum changes some exhibits during the year.  One of the most enjoyable exhibits to me is the new B&W photograpy...The Teenie Harris photography is fun to see thru someone else's eyes...people...the urban landscape and some old signs in black and white.   Another exhibit is...Picturing the City...fun great pictures of Pittsburgh and sports fans.U can spend an hour or all day and the price is very good, especially compared to some other places.
