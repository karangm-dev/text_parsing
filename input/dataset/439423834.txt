Where do I begin? This hotel was horrible and I mean horrible. The elevators smelled like urine, the carpet throughout the hotel had stains, dirt and God knows what else on it. It looked like it hadn't been shampooed since 1200 B.C. The hotel room my sister and I had sucked. There were stains on the carpet and the chairs. We didn't even want to walk on the floor without shoes on. The tv was super small and there were chips in the furniture. We were so creeped out by the room that when we were there (which was rare) we didn't sleep under the covers. We slept on top of the covers with our hoodies on. The bathroom was so small that when you sat on the toilet your knee hit the door. And let's not mention the tub filling up a tad bit when we took showers. Even though we didn't sleep under the covers housekeeping failed to change the sheets (not even once). I even combed my hair while sitting on the bed and shed a little. I came back later that night and she still had not changed them. Gross!! The only thing appealing about this hotel is the price so I guess in an essence, we got what we paid for.
