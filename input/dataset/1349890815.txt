I would fly in from Chicago just to eat here - its that amazing. App: Churros dip - out of this world!!!!Entree: Adovado Ribs is what gets me back there every-time. Stewed all day long from the morning - this pork dish falls apart the second it sees your fork coming - amazing to say the least. The hot sause on it is to die for.The tortia's are made fresh - yum yum yum.Every morning they grind their fresh peppers and is in almost everything. Their menu says it best - "sorry there is no mild or medium - just hot" if you like your New Mexican cuisine HOT but with incredible flavor - this is the place for you - NOT to be missed when in PHX.The salsa's with the chips are amazing, but you have to be careful with the heat level - when your dish comes, you mouth is ready for the fire department if you don;t pace yourself :)make sure you get a  premium Margarita as the reg one id possibly a mix - at-least tastes that way.There is one in NYC as well - one of the sisters opened - tried it and its just as good when I was there a couple years back.Service is up and down butt he owner - she is at the counter at all times and is a beautiful Latina who really loves what she is doing - great hugger too :)
