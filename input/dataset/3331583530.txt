This is our go to brunch spot on the weekend. As a vegan, it's nice to find a local place that feels super home-y and has a large variety of drinks and food! Our favorites are the ful madames and Syrian tomatoes, both of which are served with warm and fluffy pita. The service is always quick and very friendly and I love the eclectic vibe.
