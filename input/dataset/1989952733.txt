Although we did take-out this time, service was still good. There's plenty of parking and it's very accessible, food was tasty, tried the egg drop soup and the hot and sour soup , a couple of appetizers  shrimp har -gow, chicken lo main chicken shop suey walnut glazed shrimp .. the only thing I wasn't thrilled about was the BBQ pork rice noodles (but it was still ok) Definitely will be back if craving Chinese food
