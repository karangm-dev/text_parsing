While it is gratifying to have more than two people working the cash registers, it is very discouraging to have the one I ask for a price on foam - by - the - yard tell me she was too busy to put the prices on the display.  Of the three displays, not one had pricing.This is a busy location with thousands of items.  It must be tedious to tend to displays.  However, if the details are left undone, it is difficult to support the store.
