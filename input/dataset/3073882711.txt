I just paid $25 for a haircut that a blind-folded degenerate sea-monkey could have done better.!!!! Walked in asked for Deborah because a cousin of mine with natural hair had gotten all her split ends cut off and I wanted mine cut also. (It really makes a difference when you're rockin' natural hair)....OK ..so she said "I'll blow dry after the wash so I can get a true cut"...sounds about right to me and I agreed to that.  Well she must have decided that would be too much trouble because after sitting me down and filling my hands with the products they're hawking ...She starts cutting using a tiny comb on my terribly thick,full head of hair..she didn't even bother to comb my hair out after the shampoo.... the end result was a chopped up mess that was obviously uneven. I paid the $25  to avoid a scene ( and because she had washed and conditioned my hair).. ,ran my fingers through my hair..asked her if she couldn't  see how uneven the cut is ....she tried to fix it and it kept getting worse and worse until I finally told her to... Please....Just   Stop....She had the nerve to give me her card ..I gave it back and told her I wouldn't be needing it ...Worst Hair Experience  I've had in a long time...Thank God my hair grows fast....but NEVER EVER AGAIN will I step foot into  this establishment!!!! No wonder they were half empty on a Saturday!!!!
