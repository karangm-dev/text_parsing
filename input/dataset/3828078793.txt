Wanted to transfer a super 8 old movie to DVD. Two sales people at the Charleston branch incorrectly  said best buy can't assist . One of of them recommend  Costco. I found the product in best buy . A shipping box from I memories. $49.95. Two movies 50 feet in length to DVD. Cross checked online and saw the same product for $10.00 per movie. Located a rather aggressive little female manager who immediately barked ."If you want a price match we don't do that." I was comparing apples to apples. And asked if it was the same product. I honestly believe the excessive electronic signals have made the employees brain dead. I will return to best buy when I'm in the mood to watch a live zombie performance. Serious though, this place lacks serious customer service.
