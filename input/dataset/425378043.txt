We've been shopping at the co-op for about 8 years (maybe longer?) and while we still do a rotating circuit for our groceries that involves Costco, Woodman's, Trader Joe's, and the co-op (and farmer's market when in season), the co-op is great and I am so thankful that they're both on the East and West sides so it's easy to get to one of their locations. I have significant food allergies and intolerances and I am able to find so many speciality foods here that cater to my diet. Duck eggs? Check. Goat milk kefir? Check. Sheep, goat and buffalo milk cheeses? Check.Occasionally they do discontinue carrying products I like (really miss that brown rice & potato pizza crust that's not $9 each like the current one; also really miss the sheep yogurt from Sugar River but they stopped making it) but they have so many things I do love. And they are generally receptive to requests from customers for new things.I do wish the veggie prices were lower, especially off-season (brussels sprouts were $9/lb last time I was there), but I understand how it's difficult to source great food when it's not seasonally available locally. That's part of the reason why we rotate our shopping to get what we need at more affordable prices. However, we have found on many things, especially cheese, that their prices are MUCH lower than Whole Foods (which I hate to support).Also, the hot bar is great when we have family in town who have very different diets, since they prominently display their ingredients and the meat eaters and vegans can all get great options. It's not hard to get a delicious lunch for a reasonable price here.
