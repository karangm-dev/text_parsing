Wow, location is horrible!!! Scary dungeon at night- so far from McCarran car rental shuttle - out in a dusty desert field.Super long wait times - antiquated check in. Don't forget your insurance card! The one star was for the actual car, which was fine. Totally not worth the few dollars you save by not renting  from a company actually at the McCarran Rental Car station- which would be a much cleaner faster and easier experience!!!!!
