As another reviewer mentioned, this post office is super convenient if you either work or live downtown Cleveland. If you don't, don't bother because you will never find street parking. Luckily I live downtown, and this is a nice short walk over.This is located in the Arcade with many other businesses including the Hyatt hotel. So it could be a nice place to have lunch if you are around. The post office itself is nicely sized, overall clean and supplies are always stocked as far as my experience in coming here goes.The problem: the rudest people work here. I have never been to a post office with employees that are so grouchy. Not just on one occasion, but I've been here about 5 or 6 times and it is the same thing every time! I came here yesterday about 20 minutes before closing time, there was one woman working. There were two ladies in front of me, and she was just ignoring them finishing whatever it was she was working on. When she finally acknowledged them, she said it would be a minute. One minute turned into five and when she was ready to work again she says " I need to go close the door so no one else comes in" (there was still 10 minutes left before closing, she could have waited a few minutes to do it). Anyway my purpose of coming was to drop off an already packaged/postage paid item (I did it online) and while I could throw it into the paid bin, I like to get it scanned in by the post office and get a receipt. I hand it to her, she looks at it and says "You're all set". I asked her if she could please scan it in and give me a receipt. She let out the biggest sigh ever heard by man. Boy did I inconvenience her, she was so pissed off... hate this place but can't beat the location... (2 stars only for location) Wish they would teach them how to smile...
