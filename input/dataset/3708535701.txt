My personal experience on a couple of different occasions at this locations is just that this dealership doesn't seem to appreciate and respect the customer. It doesn't seem to matter if we were holding our medically fragile 2 year old in our arms when the service guy started swearing or if we are with our SENIOR CITIZEN parents and they are trying to buy a car and the salesman Johnny is so rude and ugly to them that they ended up leaving. Both times management of course said how sorry they were but the excuse was always "they are going through a tough time in their personal life right now". I get it, we all have a bad day but the common denominator is management is allowing this behavior because they are allowing these excuses to be ok. I say they need to have a training for employees on how to be present at their job, allow it to be a positive environment where you can have fun and leave your personal stuff at home. I was told many years ago that the company I was working for was "renting my behavior" while I was working. Maybe Arrowhead Honda may need to consider and share that. Personally,  the the horrible behavior I just experienced has allowed me to decide on a Toyota Highlander rather then the Pilot or any other Honda.  We purchased the Highlander a couple of weeks ago and love it. Next is getting rid of my husbands Honda. So sad we have such a continued bitter taste in our mouths over Hondas because of 1 dealership but it was and continues to be THAT BAD!!!
