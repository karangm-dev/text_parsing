What to say?  I was too busy at work to plan my Montreal dining adventures and therefore I was unable to secure a last-minute reservation at the highly recommended Joe Beef. Fortunately for us I was able to secure a late-night reservation at their sister restaurant Liverpool House.We were among one of the last tables of the evening, the service was casual yet impeccable.  The waitstaff was very knowledgeable about both the food and wine choices.  Our sever patiently explained each menu item (menu = in french on a chalkboard) to our 6-top table of tied conference-drunk women with ADHD.  When some of us ordered Oysters on the half shell our waitress graciously brought extra (as one of the amuse items) so that everyone at the table might try some. For an appetizer we consumed a foie gras sandwich nestled between a freshly baked  "English Muffin"  topped with house-cured bacon and local Artisan cheese then drizzled in local Canadian Maple Syrup.   Perhaps one of the best things we've ever eaten (unanimous on this nomination among this group of dining ladies).  Later, in celebration of our foie gras "high" the staff let us dance on an adjacent table as celebration  (note, they joined in the festivities).I pretty much wanted to come here on every remaining night in Montreal or at least try to squeeze a seat for dinner at the bar at Joe Beef.   I will probably brave Montreal in the winter months an have a culinary vacation based on this dinner.  Eat here, just do it, it's awesome !!
