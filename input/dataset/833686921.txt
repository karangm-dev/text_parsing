I had one appointment here- I didn't buy the dress but I did purchase my veil from here. The selection isn't as big as other places, but the handy part is that nothing can be ordered, you buy it from the rack. I would suggest this for brides that are running out of time. The dresses are really special and unique, but what really caught my eye was the veils. The veil was beautiful and it was a GREAT price! I desperately needed a great modern style mantilla veil with flowers in the lace and I found it here. It was integral to my wedding due to my grandma's wedding veil suddenly becoming MIA. I would recommend all brides at least stop by this place to check out the accessories.
