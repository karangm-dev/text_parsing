They are friendly, but I find their weekday hours useless - office hours only.They tend to charge a lot, and find more things to replace than I think is necessary.I was paying them $60 each spring to tune my bike.They would invariably misalign my brake pads. Last spring I found that my front wheel was wobbling and hitting one of the front brake pads. When I brought it in, they told me the $60 tune up didn't include wheel alignment. That's silly, because misaligned wheels is not acceptable. So $60 is for incomplete service. There are plenty of other bike shops around.
