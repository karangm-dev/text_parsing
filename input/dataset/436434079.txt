The name says it all - FRESH! The first few times I went I could only say that about the burgers, but now it's everything! They have recently expanded into two units so there's more fun and more burgers for all. Came on a Saturday just after 11 am (opening). Surprising there were already people there but the was definitely not long. Its a fast casual location, where you order at the front and can sit down or take out as you wish. I always order the double fresh burger and its always nice. Patty is juicy, bun is not soggy, and the other toppings (lettuce, tomato, pickles) mesh well together. Just like krabby patties there must be some secret formula to create such a masterpiece. Fries are good, long pieces that are not overly oily. Drinks are self serve and they've got a wide selection of Coke (*owner edit: AND PEPSI!) related products.  Did I mention free wifi? All in all a nice casual place to enjoy a burger. Prices are comparable to other spots (11.50) for the double fresh burger. Bonus (for me at least) is that its super close and convenient! Just off Leslie and 16th.
