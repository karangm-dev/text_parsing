This is the best dessert place I have ventured to and unfortunately it's here in Canada. Came with a wagon of kids all under the ages of 14. The store has cute booths and bar tables with delectable cakes on display. The menu itself looks like doodles a high schooler would make during class. Options are simple scoops of ice cream, crepes/waffles, milkshakes and teas. Substitutions are allowed as we substituted bananas for strawberries for the Moo La La.Summertime Fatness, Moo La La, Last Straw, Blush,  and a crepe with vanilla bean ice cream which I don't recall the name. Holy. We were expecting to get ripped off with tiny portions but oh my, Caffe Demetres, you are generous with your portions. All items were so aesthetically pleasing and we were scrambling to take pictures to post. All ice cream served were smooth and didn't have that 'sitting around' taste. The crepes and waffles didn't smell or taste like flour. The strawberries were nicely tart and a nice complement to the sweetness. I had the Summertime Fatness to myself, all chocolate with brownies, Coco Chanel ice cream, Belgian white chocolate and French Dark chocolate. I could only finish half and almost regret not sharing. Everything was tasty and not sickeningly sweet when shared. But really, I highly advise to share as five items were more than enough for 7 people. Bill was ~$77 not including tip. Afterwards, we were all given a piece of Caffe Demetres chocolate to continue our sugar rush. What an awesome establishment, thanks Caffe Demetres!
