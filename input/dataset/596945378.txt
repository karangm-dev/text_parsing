I'd avoid this Circle K (gas station). It's not in a bad area, just a lot of weird people & tweakers hanging around. So WTF are they doing, lumbering about a gas station in the Moon Valley area ? Are they zombies? I have no idea, but I'd wish Circle K's management would look into it. Until then, I'm taking my business to QT.
