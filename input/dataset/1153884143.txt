It was my first time in Vegas and let me just say, the Venetian was such a beautiful hotel to stay at. Firstly, the lobby is beautiful with the high ceilings with beautiful Grecian styled paintings. The front desk attendants were all very kind and patient. They even gave us an upgrade. We got a room with a view of the pools! After walking through the casino to get to the room towers (which wasn't too far nor was it difficult to navigate), we headed up to our magnificent room.It was spacious, clean, and so gorgeous. I really like the theme of the Venetian, makes you feel like royalty! The bathroom is the first door when you walk in and it was huge. Separate shower and bath. Great vanity space which also had a light up desk mirror in addition to the double sink. The room itself was also very spacious. Giant king bed that was so comfortable. With extra living space with sofa with a pull out bed. The two T.Vs were on the smaller side but we didn't spend much time in our rooms lounging so they weren't a huge issue. The mini bar was expensive but there were multiple Walgreen's close by so we didn't purchase anything from it!The service was impeccable. We didn't have the room cleaned everyday but when we needed it to be cleaned, we would call down and leave the room for an hour or two for a meal and it would be quickly cleaned by the time we were back. The pools are also really big and lots of chairs available. There's little to no kids and there's even an adults only pool! The food options are pretty decent. There's a couple of late night spots opened as well. Most of the time we wandered off the strip to try new things but there is definitely a variety available in the Venetian. I have no complaints about this hotel. Great service and amazing rooms.
