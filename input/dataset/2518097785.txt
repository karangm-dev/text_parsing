The person checking id's. His friends started a fight. his friend said he hated faggots. Because someone bumped into him. I went up to the front.... I told him what happened. I was told to shut my mouth...that he knew what was going on and that was his friend..he was not going to address nothing. I asked for the manager.. The manager took my concern.... The friend became agitated because he was being confronted ....he came to my friend and started arguing.... The manager came and asked us to leave...this is a gay club.. If someone doesn't like gay people they should not be here. The MOD has no skills. His just protecting people. That is why tragedies happen.
