I can't speak to their coffee, but I love to stop in for a Strawberry Fields smoothie whenever I'm in Sun Prairie. Delicious! Even better is the location. Lovely spot with a nice view, big windows, and outdoor seating. Appreciate that they have a kids' play area, board games and card games, plus a community crossword at the bar while you wait.The manager was very helpful to me on one occasion. Will certainly be back!
