One of the coolest meals I have ever had. Watching a hibachi chef cook my food in front of me was a real treat.This place gets super crowded, so come early (or really late) and try making a reservation (although they will still probably make you wait).We had to wait a long time before they took our order and a lot more time after that before they started cooking our stuff before us, but once that starts, it all really becomes worth it.I am vegetarian so had miso soup, stir-fried mushrooms, vegetables and tofu with sticky rice (and sake!!).. it was all delicious... watching your food get made in front of you makes it soo much tastier.Portions are enormous, so don't overorder.Great place to catch up with friends and have a lot of fun.
