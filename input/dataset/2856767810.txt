Went to this spot because a friend wanted to go. Cost was $35 and was NOT worthed it, not even close. The food made me realized how good I got it coming from San Diego where we have Pala. The food at Cravings was like at Hometown buffet. I usually eat A LOT, but could not stomach the food here. I mean, the food  was not fresh or appetizing. I can honestly say I did not enjoy anything there, but the beer. I will not be back.
