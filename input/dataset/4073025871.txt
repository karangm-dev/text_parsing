Recent trip to Medina on late Saturday afternoon.  Service was fast and friendly - no complaints there.  Unique decor and atmosphere.  We went for the burgers b/c of the rave reviews but all four adults left not happy with their burgers!  We all ordered a different specialty burger and fries (the fries are outstanding btw) but none of us cared for the texture of the burger.  Just a very weird color, texture and mouth feel.  They also use a seasoning mix on the burgers that we did not like either.
