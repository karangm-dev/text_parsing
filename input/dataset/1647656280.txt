My nails and toes look amazing! White tips and clear polished toes. Usually my fingers hurt after putting nails on from other places but this time at Reflections,  it was done gently and professionally. My nails look natural and beautiful. My pedicure was amazing, orange scrub and massage wow. My feet were really dry and my toes were yellowish from all the nail polish and now they are as silky smooth as my sheets and the discoloration is gone. I couldn't be happier with my phalanges!
