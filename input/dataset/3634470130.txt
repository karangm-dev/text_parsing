HORRIBLE Customer Service.   after having one of the bottles that were improperly secured ruin a $125 sweater.    I brought it to the attention of the manager Darren that stated they would make it right.     He just had to speak with his owner John and then they'd be in touch.      I did speak with the owner John and he was very hesitant to believe my story and sounded skeptical but he'd look into it and get back to me.   7 days later no reply.      I called several times with no return call and finally wrote some reviews.   afterwards  owner Johnathan Luther sent me a reply email stating due to my reviews he is not interested in my loss and rather lose me as a customer.   There are soo many good restaurants in the area.   Go to one that cares about their customers.     support local and boycott  JJ Red hots" my offer is now $0.It didn't have to end this way, but that was your choice, not mine. We never like to lose a customer, but in this case, I feel like we came out even"JJ
