Bought a bow here. They have nice equipment. But, the staff member I worked with seemed like he didnt have time for me and any questions i had. I got a too cool for school kind of vibe here. Should have purchased elsewhere and i wont be going back. Told my close friend to take his $1200 bow purchase elsewhere. Sportsmans warehouse has much friendlier customer service.
