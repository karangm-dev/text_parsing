Rasheen is super professional! If you are new to the Valley and you're seeking a private suite/salon, a great stylist and awesome hair products, this is the place for you! My visit included a complete sew-in, which was completed within a couple hours. (Love that!) Also very pleased with the hair which I purchased from her studio. She has everything from super curly to straight. I am currently wearing the curly and it is simply lovely!  One more point, she offers other services which include microblading and I think nails as well.  Experience the high quality, you deserve it!!!
