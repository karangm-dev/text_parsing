I have been taking my car to Sammy's for over ten years now. New cars and old jalopies, i trust Sammy (and his crew). When searching for a garage, i asked everyone i knew for someone they trust. I didn't want the cheapest (although they are competitive), but I wanted to pay fair value for quality work performed. I disagree with the other reviews posted here (which is what prompted me to write this one). Sammy's Service Centre is excellent.
