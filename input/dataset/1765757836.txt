I've been to a lot of nail salons in my life and I have to say this has been the best nail salon I've ever been to!! First of all the salon is spacious and they don't mind turning on the A/C!! It's meticulously clean. The staff is super friendly and helpful. This has been the only place where I have not been cut or even nicked. I have very small hands and nails. At other places I would literally get yelled at for " nails too small!" Another thing I noticed was that they have invested in great air circulation. At each station they have a vent system so all the particles /fumes go in there instead of all over you. This is very important to me because I suffer from chronic migraines and strong scents trigger it. I made the mistake of trying to go somewhere closer to me and I asked how long would it be and I was told " pick color!" I said no how long will it be and he said " 3 mins pick color! " I looked around and there were about 6 women sitting down with their colors in their hands , all sweating because they had the door open and no A/C. I said it doesn't look like it will be 3 mins . I started walking out and could hear them saying something but I didn't know their language. Will only go to pedicure Lounge and no where else no matter what!!!
