Dr. Liu could possibly be the best dentist in Las Vegas.  Five stars to the staff as well.  Never enjoying going to the dentist in my life and not having the best smile but Dr. Liu is caring and makes sure you are ok as he does what he does with the most care and least pain.  I don't know how he can do what other dentists are not capable of in taking care to make sure the experience is as painless as possible yet you can tell he has your best interest in everything he does.  I can recommend Dr Liu and his staff to any of my friends, clients and co-workers and know they will be pleased and I have for many years. He and his staff deserve their success as a successful honest dental practice here in Las Vegas.
