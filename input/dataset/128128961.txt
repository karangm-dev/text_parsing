Amazingly Fresh!!! The food here is great. Everything seasoned very well with some really great tastes. I had a combo plate with steak and chicken. The falafel was awesome and the bread is amazing they have their own bakery with some of the best bread I have ever had. I do P90x so it was great to find a place that is delicious and healthy. I am no vegan but the vegan desert was out of this world with pistachios on it and it was so light you didn't feel bad for eating it. My wife's favorite thing was this eggplant salad dish and my one year olds liked the humus and the bread as well. It just opened so it took a few minutes for the food but definitely worth the wait and I have been back twice in two weeks. Nice family run place that cares about quality for sure and great if you want something healthy as well. Highly recommend
