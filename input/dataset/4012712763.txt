Utterly incompetent. That describes 360 Physical Therapy in Gilbert. I was recently referred there after having knee surgery.  First, they were given the correct phone number by the physician's office but either wrote it down incorrectly or were just stupid enough to keep calling an incorrect number. After a week and a half of not reaching me did they check back with the physician's office to ensure they had the correct number? Nope. Instead, I called them to start my PT which should have begun two weeks earlier. Do you think I would schedule that very important appointment incorrectly in my records? Probably not.  However, when I arrived this morning I was told, "I'm sorry, I have you scheduled for tomorrow."  Now, I understand mistakes are made, but the lack of attention to detail and laziness associated with this office is inexcusable. I hope the actual therapists are good, but probably not good enough to make up for the galactically stupid administrators.
