Sitting at the bar and it smells as in stinks like a toilet.  We mention it to the bartender and he says that management is aware of it. Sorry I couldn't even finish my beer and of course the hooters wings got neglected. Sad case of a neglected facility so many other choices in Vegas make a better one than I did.
