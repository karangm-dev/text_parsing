Horrible service due to long wait to get our order in, get the food, and get the check. Just ate here today (Monday) for lunch. Even though there wasn't many other customers, service was extremely slow-I only saw two servers working.  I had fried shrimp and fries, the other people in my party had French toast with eggs and the bucket of shrimp. The food was ok, nothing special.
