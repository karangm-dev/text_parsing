Yuck! Here is why. We sat at the Sushi Bar and the stupid thing is constructed so you can't watch the chef's make the sushi. That is 1/2 the fun! Because the bar is so high you are eye to eye with the dead fish creatures. I had parts of an octopus staring at me the whole time. I am vegetarian so that was creepy. The writing on the menu is so tiny it is ridiculous. I ordered the edamame and it was awful. How do you f'up edamame? My guess, didn't leave it in the microwave long enough. My b/f said the sushi was "ok" but nothing spectacular. The last straw for me is from the sushi bar you look right into the dishwasher area. Great appetizing view that was. Take a pass on this place!Update: The manager called me to sort out the problems we had there on the 4th of July. They seemed genuinely interested in fixing the problems. He invited us back the next time we are in Vegas, which will be soon most likely. I will advise on how it goes.
