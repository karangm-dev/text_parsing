I haven't been to this place for over a year. I used to regularly go here for sushi until ONE DAY, I picked up a take out order for about $45 and I had just finished paying when I saw a MOUSE run across the doorway of their kitchen behind the cash register area. I told the waitress and she played stupid with me and said that they had just passed the inspection.  I can't and won't go back there.  So there is no point in critiquing the food there - my guess is most plazas on that strip probably have mice running around or that they were coming in from another store but wth.  This was probably 8 months ago.
