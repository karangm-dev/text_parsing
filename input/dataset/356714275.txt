Came here for an advanced movie screening a few months back and all I have to say is ehhh....All the employees I encountered were so rude and bored looking. Seriously they all were so lazy and non attentive! First there was the guy at the box office. He was sitting down and slowly and lazily walked over to help us with our tickets.. Then there were the two guys at the concession stand....so lazy and stupid. I had a question they should have been able to answer, forgot what it was, but they just shrugged their shoulders with no response and turned their backs to me and walked away to do nothing. everyone who was trying to purchase popcorn had to get the popcorn scoopers attention because he sure didnt offer to take any popcorn orders.Worst service at a century theater EVER.
