Living in Hawaii, I try to eat as much In-N-Out Burger when I'm in the West Coast and Shake Shack when I'm in New York. I think the burgers at In-N-out taste really good with the veggies being fresh. I like the service too and how they ask if I want onions with the burger. I don't and I usually forget to order without onions at order burger joints. So I just remove them. The shakes are good too but i usually order the secret menu one. Over all, I think they have the best value burger with the freshest ingredients. Shakes too!
