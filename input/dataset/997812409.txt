Date night. Food was very good and authentic. Seemed a bit "dated" in the decor and, well, the place smelled like cats. Definitely cats. Lost two points because it was that disturbing. They did lots of take out so perhaps the locals know something. Not sure I would go back as the smell is still with me. Sorry.
