The breakfast here is on the acceptable side of average, but the service left something to be desired. We treated our dear friend to breakfast at this restaurant of her choosing. The waitress was short with her and did not seem to care to listen to the way our guest wanted her eggs prepared. Excuse me, this place is called  the Cracked Egg. What's done with it after it's cracked is supposed to be up to the customer, hear? It was a very tense and awkward moment. The dimwitted waitress brushed us off, and our friend had to raise her voice and repeat herself maybe three times. She also had to describe herself as the customer, lest the waitress not get it. It was appalling that it should have to be explained!The food was mediocre but the employee's poor attitude really ruined the atmosphere.
