I love local businesses and this was such a great way to get out and support. We tried almost every sample and even got free water. Some businesses were giving out free samples as well. They had local bands playing at the event and also had an area just for the food trucks. Loved all the crafty businesses, too- some very unique and beatiful items to look at and buy. My favorite was the organic soap business. Those soaps not only looked and smelled amazing but were also made from organic ingredients. All in all, everyone was very friendly and professional and I had a great time.
