On our family vacation we stayed in Las Vegas for a night at the Cancun Resort and as we were yelping for Mexican food near by, we came across Taco y Taco. Based on the reviews and ratings we decided to give it a try. There was 15 people in our party and luckily there was enough room for all of us. As we were checking out the menu, the owner (I think) came out and told us if we wanted to try any meat to ask the staff, which was great from her part. The food was AMAZING and the staff as well. It was so good that we went two days in a row and let me say this is going to be the spot we go to every time we are in Las Vegas. Thank you Taco y Taco....two thumbs up!!!
