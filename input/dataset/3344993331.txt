horrible customer service. I arrived right behind another guest and the fat manager was outside the door smoking a cigarette in one hand and told me I can't come in because they were closed when 20 seconds before another guest walked in, I asked if I could get a can of choice noodle soup for my mom and she said im sorry I cant. took another puff on her cancer stick and walked her obese self back into the store and hand pulled the electric door closed. just awful service, I'm sure she was ready to get off a get to her buffet style dinner but she was not the standard I'm used to with these location's. no wonder they have low ratings for this location.  sad.
