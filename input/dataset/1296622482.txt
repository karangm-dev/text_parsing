I stayed here the weekend of 10/21/2016 and I agree.  Don't stay here.  It is not worth saving a few dollars.  The main problem is the bar right next to the hotel.  They play loud music all night long.  We tried complaining to the bar people but they told us that the bar and the hotel are owned by the same people and that we should complain to hotel front desk.  They told us they have received a lot of complaints and they have told the owners but the owners don't care.  The owners have a permit for the music and they are going to play loud music all night long.  I could not sleep most of the night and I had to work Saturday and Sunday.Also, right next door there is a statue of a praying mantis that shoots fire out of its antennae.  It is very loud and even in your room it sounds like you are in a war zone.  At least this noise stops at midnight.  Unlike the music.The rooms are not very nice and look shabby.  The closet space does not even have a bar to hang hangers on.  The hot water in shower was very uneven and would switch randomly from hot to cold.The only good things about the hotel are the great restaurants within walking distance and the housekeeping service.  I did not think housekeeping would come to clean the room but they did come and did a good job.
