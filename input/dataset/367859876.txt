Terrible, terrible, terrible. Oh, and did I mention terrible?I landed at McCarren on a Tuesday evening and got to the rental car center at 9:30 PM with an Advantage reservation in hand: 4 days for about $80 all told, including taxes.Not only was there a line of about fifteen people waiting to get to the counter (I stood in this line for nearly an hour), there was only one person working the desk for most of that time. When I FINALLY got to speak to someone, I was told that simply because I was paying using a debit card instead of a credit card (I don't have/carry a credit card), I would be subjected to both a credit check AND my card would be CHARGED--not authorized, CHARGED--$350. This policy was not displayed anywhere on the website that I saw, nor was I notified in advance.Long story short--I waited in line for no reason and walked away without a car. On the bright side, at least my taxi ride to my hotel was half of what the online calculators had estimated.
