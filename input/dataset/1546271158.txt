I searched for the closest shipping center near me, and found Safe Ship. To be honest, I chose this business primarily because of their high ratings. I had to ship two extra large packages to Hawaii, and wanted tracking and arrival signatures but didn't want to pay an arm & leg for it. Ben was of great help and got me the best deal possible with my packages' specific weights and dimensions. I couldn't be happier with my experience and highly recommend Safe Ship to anyone!
