PRC consulted on 2 tile roof replacements at apartment communities we manage in the greater Phoenix area. PRC was thorough and caught a number of items the roofer needed to correct on both jobs. Their communication was great. A roof is a major investment and having a professional help manage installation is money well spent.The specific services provided were initial condition and spec reports and roughly 5 job inspections per property.
