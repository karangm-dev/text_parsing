My experience with Dr. Malek has been nothing short of fantastic. His staff is professional and kind, and they're great at answering questions without being pushy or sales-like. Dr. Malek was kind while retaining a very professional demeanor. (Honestly, the first time I met with him, I had almost wished that he had been a bit more "friendly" vs. doctor-patient, but he was obviously experienced and competent. On the day of the surgery, I appreciated that bit of professional distance that he kept and felt comfortable in his hands and under his care.)  He and his staff were great about working with my crazy schedule and finding times that would work for me. Everything was very upfront. There were zero hidden charges or unexpected costs. Dr. Malek customized the procedure to obtain the best results for my particular situation and explained to me in detail what he suggested and why he felt it was the best approach. The results are incrdible. (I've used the word magician quite a few times when speaking about Dr. Malek's skill.) Pain or discomfort was exremely minimal and I can't begin to describe how thrilled I am that I chose to have the procedure done and to have Dr. Malek do it.
