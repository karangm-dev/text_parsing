Had a dinner night with a girlfriend at Royale and everything was great! The service was good and we went with several recommendations from our server. Atmosphere and decor were quite nice. Good cocktails. Solid food: We shared the mushroom poutine, the sea bass, the scallop & pork belly and the apple tart. All dishes were delicious and were very happy with our meal. The prices and portions were reasonable. Excited to return to try other dishes.
