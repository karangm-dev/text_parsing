While I had a very pleasant time at the bar and the drink I ordered was good, I can only give one star and honestly would've given no stars, if allowed, due to my experience with the choice of music played. I am a music fan and enjoy many different genres however I draw the line when it becomes culturally insensitive . I was and still am highly offended when I'm trying to enjoy myself and I hear a song playing very loudly that is clearly using the n-word. At first I thought it was a mistake but noticed as time went on that the unedited versions were playing and the n-word was as played several times. I brought this the the managers attention and was basically told the owner has received this complaint several times, likes to play his preferred music and that my concern would be conveyed again. Translation is the owner doesn't cater to people like me, doesn't care about offending others and to basically get over it. So I will actively choose to spend my money where there is an understanding of cultural competence and sensitivity and tell anyone who asks to not patronize this place.
