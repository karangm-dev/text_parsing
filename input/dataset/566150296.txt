I was completely surprised to see that Jacky Chan's only has three stars. I hope that changes soon, because the food is AMAZING! I asked friends on FB where to go for great egg drop soup near Mountain's Edge/Southern Highlands and someone recommended Jacky Chan's. I ordered it to be delivered, and it was a rather large order. Soup, five different boxes of rice/noodles, pan fried potstickers, pan fried veggies, papaya boba. I think nine items total. I barely got to taste my rice and veggies because I simply could not stop eating the soup! It was so delicious, best egg drop soup I've ever had. I ate the entire bowl. Not cup, BOWL. And it's a BIG bowl. I'm still full as I write this and I already want more for dinner. Enough about the soup lol! According to the others in my group, everything else we ordered was fantastic too. The price was great, the staff on the phone was very nice and professional, the delivery driver was super nice and even though I was given a 45 minute delivery window, our food was here in 25 minutes and was super hot. I will most definitely order from here again. Probably tonight. Lol!
