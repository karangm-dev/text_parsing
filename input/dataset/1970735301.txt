Ehhh... Not impressed. I came in 15 mins till closing time so the girl couldn't be bothered with me. She let me browse for 2 mins before saying that she's closing up in 5 mins. Of course I rushed and just picked the vanilla ice cream on a sugar cone since I couldn't read the other flavors mentioned in French.  How can vanilla be that bad right?? $4.05 for two scoops later... I was ready to toss it. The ice cream started to melt immediately and it was a cool 65 degrees outside. It wasn't creamy in texture. It was just meh. I'm not impressed. The shop also looks a bit rundown.
