After reading reviews on this place, it seemed like the only thing wrong with the store were the customers themselves.  I didn't think much of it and decided to go based on the other reviews.  At first glance the store is wonderful, the building itself is beautiful and the selection is pretty varied which is fantastic.  Most of the produce looked great (some not so much) and there were tastings in multiple places!  However, I can see the point about the people ruining the experience.  Little things here and there such as, being glared at when tasting the cheeses (I tried one of each and bought my favorite one).  Having my cart pushed aside unceremoniously by a customer without a word.  The deli women and their general and blatant unhappiness (which this extended to basically all of the employees except the one cashier who checked me out--she was quite friendly).  And lastly the customers themselves all looked like their common ancestor was Grumpy the dwarf from Snow White.So frankly, if you want to go there it's great for prepared foods and general shopping, the prices are about what you'd figure for a city (EXCEPT THE MEAT--WHICH IS WAY TOO EXPENSIVE, 4 - 8oz flank steaks for over $44?!). Craziness.  It gets 2 stars for it's selection, but definitely 3 knocked off for the atmosphere.
