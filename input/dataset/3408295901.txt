Had a fender bender, decided to use the other parties insurance who did not want to work with me, however the guys at Rapid Collision took care of everything and made a stressful situation into a quick and pleasant experience. The guys are professional, friendly, and quick. The front fender of my highlander needed to be replaced and was expecting my car to take about a week or so to fully replace, instead I found out that the job was done within 3 days, and my new fender looks like new. These guys are great, thank you Nate and Jason for all you kind service. This shop is going to be my new mechanic shop for sure, and I could not give this place any better of a review.
