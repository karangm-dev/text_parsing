Travelling quite frequently for business, I have the luxury of visiting Boxes all across our great land.  This was one of the better experiences I have had!  Alex, a coach, was incredibly welcoming and spent time showing me the gym, where the facilities were, stretch area, etc. (never had a tour before during a visit).  The overall box is very well equipped with plenty of space for a larger class.  I took the 6:00 a.m. class and there were only 4 of us though.  The workout was tough, but well organized.If you live in the area, this seems like a quality box and one that I would happily visit again.
