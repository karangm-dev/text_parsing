So glad we stopped in to Wingtime tonight. We tried the lemon pepper and garlic parmesan wings.  These weren't skimpy wings, they were a nice, substantial size and they were seasoned perfectly.  The food came out fresh and steaming. The ranch, blue cheese and chipotle honey sauces should be sold by the jar.  The crinkle cut fries and Texas toast are included in the combo, so good! The girls at the counter were patient and helpful while we took a little time to figure out our order since it was our first time.  The owner was a joy to talk to, we'll definitely be back to try some of the other wing flavors and menu items!
