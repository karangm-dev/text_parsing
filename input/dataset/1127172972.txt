I have worked reception at American AllStar Realty for 7 years. In that time, I have witnessed this company's core of dedicated real estate agents work tirelessly for their clients every day. They are genuinely great group of people who love their jobs.  I always recommend our agents to friends and family when they express an interest in buying or selling without hesitation.  Plus, in my completely biased opinion, they have an amazing receptionist. ;)
