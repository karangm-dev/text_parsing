If there was an option for zero stars I would give this place that. Wish I had read the reviews first! Horrible place!  They did an aweful job on our minivan and when I asked them to ensure they vacuum out the van they tried twice and still missed everything in the third row seats. Please don't waist your time (there for over an hour) or money at this place!
