I Love this place so much, I drive an hour to an hour and and a half just to go to my stylist Jessi. I have never had a bad haircut, color (which I never pick a "normal" color), style, or overall experience. I love the mini hand massages and facials. It really makes the whole drive worth it. The only issue is I wish I lived closer, I really have to put my whole day aside to make this trip, but it is very much worth it!!!!
