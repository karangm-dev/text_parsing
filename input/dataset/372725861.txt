This place has really gone downhill. A few years back when it had first opened it was a great place for decently priced Japanese/Korean food. Came here recently and found the quality has decreased. There's no parking in the front of the plaza where Gal's is, you will have to park in the main parking area or underground and walk around. The decor is a typical Japanese restaurant though I will say there are lots of tables and the restaurant is always lively. There are decently priced lunch and dinner combos and will come with Korean glass noodles, rice, soup and salad. The sashimi in my combo today was thinly sliced with little to no fish flavour.  Texture felt a bit odd so I ended up not eating  all of it. The sushi looked like it was falling apart.  The plates and soup bowls are lined red interior and the ink/paint is peeling off badly. Not only does this make it look dated, I also feel like the paint might go into my food. Please replace your bowls and plates.
