Our experience has been a nightmare!  I would give less stars if i could!  Our unit is less than one year old and has spent most of the months we've owned it in the service department.  It is of course broken again and they can't even get the unit in to look at it for two months!  The unit we purchased (Grand Design Momentum) is garbage and the service is TERRIBLE!!!  Their theory is the issues are the manufacturer's issues not theirs!  After all the issues we've had they should be bending over backwards to try and help...especially since our unit is still under warranty and they could care less!!!!
