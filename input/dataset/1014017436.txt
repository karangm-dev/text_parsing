I enjoyed my experience at the Olive Garden, I had the 2 for $25 dollar special and enjoyed a lovely dinner with my family for Father's Day! We were so lucky to have Tyler ( from Texas) as our server, he was so efficient in made sure that we are treated as Family. He took our order and made sure that our food was prepared and boxed correctly. I highly recommend this Olive Garden and will be sure to return. Amazing food, experience and service!!
