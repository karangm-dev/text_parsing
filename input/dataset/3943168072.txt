Everyone is so friendly and knows how to perfectly get the job done with very minimal pain. Everytime i get waxed, i have such nice conversations with the workers and they help me stay distracted and relaxed during the appointment! No one has ever been pushy or weird, everyone has been kind and fun and sweet! The hard wax is a life saver, it barely hurts at all and it makes the appointments so quick and painless!The memberships are a perfect choice for regular waxers, you get benefits like a free extra wax during your birth month and 15% off all products, while getting a great discount on the services you choose. It's the perfect place to go to!
