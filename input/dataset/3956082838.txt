Just got my eyelashes done & I LOVE them!! I have had them done before obviously for way more expensive person somewhere else but for a person that doesn't wear a lot of makeup and only pretty much does her eyelashes these are PERFECT and the price is AMAZING! They are a bit more noticeable and the glue is more noticeable that they are fake but I did get mine dramatic and full might be different for a more natural look. Overall staff is friendly I made an appointment and got taken in immediately. I will be updating on how long they actually last before my next fill.
