Hello Heaven you do exist.... Oh my goodness!!!! My cousin who lives in Vegas told me about Inglot. When he told me about it he was soooooo excited. He said he and all of his male friends love this place and that's all they use. I thought hhmmm a bunch of grown men with better skin and manicures then me love this place, it's gotta be good. Oh my gosh he was sooooooo right!!!! I walked in and it was love at first sight! The staff was so helpful and friendly. The first time I went in I met a boy I seriously wish I could have stuck him in my purse and took him home with me. His name is Le Creme. He made me feel like we where playing dress up. He made my experience sooo much fun that when I go out with my husband or my girlfriends and I wear my inglot face I seriously have the best time. I feel fun flirty and free. The make up is WAY less pricier then MAC and the pigments are just as pigmented If not more. You have to go in and just play with the make up. So far I've tried and bought everything but the lashes.
