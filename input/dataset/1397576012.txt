I have driven by this place at least 20 times and always see the specials thinking wow we should go. Finally my boyfriend and I thought hey, let's do this. Walking in they were friendly and seated us immediately. We explained it was our first time here. The waitress explained there was happy hour and there was all you can eat sushi. We compared the menu and prices and decided to do all you can eat since it was only 23 a person for dinner. Salmon belly, fresh and great. Only one order per person for dinnerDumplings. Great size. Good filling. Perfectly steamed. I hate when they are soggy. I can't remember all the names of the rolls because we had about the of them but they were all very good and fresh. The only little complaint I have is that the ones that said they were spicy were not that spicy (boyfriend complaint) but I'm not a fan of spicy rolls so I thought they had a kick but were delicious. Very good food for a even greater price. This restaurant had a very nice family feel. Waitress was good on refilling drinks, recommending rolls, and keeping food coming. They had a full house and we never waited more than 5 -10 minutes for rolls or whatever we ordered. Like the large amount of options for mochi.
