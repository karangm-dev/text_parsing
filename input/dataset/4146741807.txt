This place would be better off as a nightclub rather than a fast food joint. We got here at 6:00 in the morning and they were BLASTING rock music from their PA system. It was so loud, no one could hear that their orders were ready. Many people complained and the staff did nothing about it. Many customers just left rather than try to order.
