The Yolk Cafe is worth the journey to Rock Hill!  I'm so happy they are opening a location Uptown in a month or so!!  I was floored by my breakfast, I mean totally shocked.  Service was really good, coffee was delicious, we ordered a couple of plates and shared.  My highlight was white mac and cheese with charred radicchio and pecan gremolata with an egg over easy flopped in the middle! The grits were some of the best grits, I've ever had in a restaurant. Super fattening, the way grits should be and salted correctly.   Count me in!! It has such a good vibe, the owners are there and it seems like a friendly, family work environment, it shines through with the service and food.
