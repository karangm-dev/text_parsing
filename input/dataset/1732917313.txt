Great place to grab a local drink! Portside is off the beaten path of downtown, which is nice since it's never crazy busy, and nothing is better than being next to the lake! They have a solid list of local beers and you have the option to make your own sampler if you don't want to commit to 16oz of one beer. They also have great cocktails made with local spirits (during the holidays I recommend the apple cider + spiced rum)! Food menu isn't amazing but they have enough to get by and what they do have is solid quality and flavor. Overall this is definitely one of my favorites when looking for a local hangout with a great atmosphere!
