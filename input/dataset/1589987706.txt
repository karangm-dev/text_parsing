Something has drastically changed at this facility in the past few months.  Different staff and horribly different results. I started noticing swirl marks in the finish of my car (which is black) and windshield left with a haze or film when finished and observed in the sunlight. Last week while waiting in line, I observed one of the workers at the first stage was using a wet cloth  to wipe out the wheel wells of a vehicle, then used the same cloth on the quarter panels and other surfaces of the vehicle.  I immediately removed myself from the line, found the cashier to report what I had just seen, and asked for a refund.  He stated he couldn't do that as the manager was not there.I've used this facility almost every week for over a year and will never return. Their current techniques will destroy pristine car finishes and nobody seems to care. I would give 0 stars if possible.
