So, my 6th time at Harvest tonight.  I love the menu at this place. I am a foodie and the flavors are rich.  I am disappointed to write this review.  Not sure what happened tonight but food was average and service was awful.  My food was cold and they lost money because the waiter never asked if we wanted more drinks.  The struggle was real and constant. Also, time for an update.  The toilets have a cardboard tops instead of porcelain.  WTF.  Dear Chef, they are not executing your vision.  Dear Owner, spend some money on an update or you'll be closing soon.
