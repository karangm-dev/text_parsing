Anytime garage doors was recommended to me by a friend, but I was a little nervous because of all the negative reviews on here. I was soooo impressed by their service! I was given a 2 hour time slot at a convenient time on the day after I called. The technician arrived within the first half hour of my time slot. He was very friendly and professional. The work was completed quickly, thoroughly, and neatly. I felt like he was being very honest with me about costs and what needed to be done. I was so pleased with the whole experience!
