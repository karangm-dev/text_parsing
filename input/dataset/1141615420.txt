So excited to have a new (and unique!) restaurant on St. Clair West. We had the halibut and chips, and both were delicious.  The fish was perfectly cooked, and the batter was light and crispy.  The fish to batter ratio was perfect. There were far too many fries for one person to manage - next time we will go with the two piece and share the fries. The decor is fun (ship inspired + upcycled church fixtures) and the staff are really friendly - we will definitely be back soon!! Thanks Sea Witch, for anchoring on St. Clair!
