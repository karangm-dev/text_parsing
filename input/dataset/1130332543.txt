If you're looking for delicious hamburgers and fries, look elsewhere. I ordered a Western burger with fries and both were mediocre. The bread was so hard and crispy and the sesame seeds on the bun were brown (the hell). The onion rings (if that's what you want to call them) had no flavor and the pickles had no place being on the burger. The only thing I enjoyed was the water. Save your money and go elsewhere.
