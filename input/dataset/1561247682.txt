First time! I frequent this area so I remembered it when I had a craving for a Greek salad.  I ordered a Greek chicken salad to go.  The restaurant was clean and the employees were pleasant.  I will definitely be back since the the salad was delicious.  I am interested in trying some of the other items on the menu.
