This is the worst customer service I've ever been to. I ordered the drunken noodle that suppose to be wide rice noodle but I got the egg noodle instead. I called and they said that's the kind of noodle they made in their drunken noodle which is the worst!!!! Called again cannot return or exchanged. Bad bad bad bad bad bad bad!!!!! The lady up front yelled at me and said if you want another one you have to buy a new one.. really????? I wish I can put a neg star!!!
