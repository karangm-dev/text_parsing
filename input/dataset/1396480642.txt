Bottom line, the food was tasteless and terrible. Mine went in the trash. We should have returned it all and gotten our money back but the weather was rainy and the traffic was heavy and my husband didn't want to drive back.We got the combination platter dinners.  All the fish was overcooked and dry. It was all tasteless. The batter hard and taste. This slaw was way sweet. The hush puppies were tough doughy and tasteless. We'll never go there again. I wouldn't feed Captain's Galley's food to a dog.
