Wouldn't even give 1 star!  Horribly tasting food and really bad service! The waiter was not bad but he should tell the customer if something we're ordering is going to be too much for a person to eat..  While they server placed the fajitas,  2/4 brocollis fell out.. They forgot the add the 1/3 part of the fajitas - the sweet potato! The Quinoa Super Bowl was so bad! Over all horrible experience!  Never going back here..
