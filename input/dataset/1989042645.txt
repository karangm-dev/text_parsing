This is my favorite free show on the strip.  When the fountains dance to Andrea Bocelli, it's beautiful.  It isn't as great when they sync it to Elvis.  Nevertheless...for me, this is a must see when I'm taking someone new to the strip.Check it out from Mon Ami Gabi @ Paris, the Fontina Bar @ Bellagio, or the Eiffel Tower.  I have a few more days in Vegas and I'm sure I'll be seeing the shows at least 4 more times.
