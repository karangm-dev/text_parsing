We love this pastries shop during our stayed in Montreal. I tried a few other bakeries near the area, I don't believe in going back to the same place twice when exploring a new town. However this place is so good. They have the most amazing chocolate croissant, almond croissant, blueberry tart and not to mention their specialty kouign amann. The only thing that we didn't like was the apple turnover( a little tart for our taste) and the cafe au lait(a little on the light side).
