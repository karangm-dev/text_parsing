If I could give a zero I would. Went in to see the owner of the salon for some blonde bayalage and to cut off the ends of my hair. Came out with brassy hair and my very, long hair was just pass my shoulders. The color I was left with was this brown color with brassy highlights concentrated at the bottom. I called and the owner agreed to have me come back to fix the color and get what I originally wanted free of charge. In my second appointment, he basically spread that brassy, orange color all over my hair. It was horrifying. I had to go spend more money in another salon to try to fix the color I had. The new hairdresser couldn't believe I had paid for such a color. Very disappointed and heartbroken.
