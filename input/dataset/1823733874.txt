Typical Story, My AC goes out and I call for repair.  The lady that I spoke to on the phone said that the tech would be out today (9/11) between 8 AM and 1 PM and no specific time could be set.  At 12:35 PM the Tech calls and asks me if it is raining.  I reply yes.  He follows up with "is your home a two-story" to wit I replied "no".  He then told me that he was on his way and would be there in 20 minutes.  Five minutes later the office calls to confirm the appointment.  It is now 30 Minutes later and he arrives. I meet him out side (in the rain no less) and he tells me it is raining.  This is pretty obvious; but then says that he cannot make any repairs in the rain.  Unbelievable!
