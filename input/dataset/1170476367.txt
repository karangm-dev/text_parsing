Shame on me for going to this guy three times since he lives so close to me but I had enough. I think he overcharges too much and I really don't think he is all that friendly. He didn't repair my shoes the first time completely as my zipper kept unlocking again and I returned it the second time to tell him that and he wanted me to pay more so I just returned the shoes, wasted money AND he didn't call like he said.  The second time I brought my bag and he actually fixed it and that was pretty good but it was still a bit overpriced to my liking. Not only that, he forgot to call me again  so I had to go back there myself to check if it was okay.The third time I wanted to get another bag fixed and he forgot to call me (although I know it is my responsibility as well but I wanted to see if he actually would call but he didn't just like the first two times) so I left my bag there and just forgot about it. NEVER going here again...EVER.UPDATE 1.18.2012I HATE THIS GUY! Never have I hated any business owner but he takes the cake. So mind you, my bag that I left since September was still there. He called me and asked if I was picking it up or he would donate it but I told him I'd get it anyway. This guy had the nerve to charge my brother $20 which I had rightfully already paid. If I had this bag since September because my ass didn't call, I would give it to my customer for FREE because that's customer service which he obviously lacks. Even my brother within the first few seconds could tell he was obnoxious. I would NEVER recommend him. I am beyond furious!
