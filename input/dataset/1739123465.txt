We booked reservations for Bella Vita, across in the District and wished we ate there instead. But the parents wanted to try here so I cancelled Bella. Our chicken parm and picatta were both salty. Strike one ! Brought a bottle of Duckhorn wine which I was told it was $20 corkage at Bella, but Bottiglia charges $35 corkage fee. Strike two ! The entrees are al carte so an extra side of pasta, which other restaurants include free with entrees, are $8 more. Strike three ! Salads are expensive at $12. Better value Italian restaurants around town than this one. I would have given it a one star rating but our server, Kevin, was great. He deserved a 25%+ tip. Sorry Stations, but your Italian restaurants have gone down hill. Like the one at Texas Station. You once had the best antipasto salad but new chef decided to cut it off the menu. We never went back and won't be back here either.
