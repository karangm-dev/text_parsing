Father's Day dinner, not good! The cook must LOVE salt, because my chicken parm was sooooo salty. The calamari was soooo salty. The fish and chips was missing that light flakey  batter. The Long Island drink special had way to much sour mix and can't help but wonder if he or she made me a virgin. Picking new places to try is always a gamble.
