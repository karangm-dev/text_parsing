Brunch is my favorite thing to do on the weekends. We came here based on yelp reviews eventhough when I looked it up the photos on yelp did not look that spectacular for me to be excited about visiting,at least in my own visual perspective. For a Sunday this place is empty. Okay it could be some factors but for a Sunday it's a bit odd for it to be just us (1 table) This is my first time to be "the only table" to be served, so I guess I expect to be served well, granted we are the only table. I can't complain about the service since it's only us.  It'll be weird if I have to wait 30 mins for a dish. We tried the grilled pork belly benedict and french toast. For the Pork Belly Benedict, it was just alright nothing that would want me to come back & try it again. The meat and fat ratio is more towards the pork fat and the potatoes are extremely dry, bland and cold. As for the French Toast I like the crunchiness but nothing epic. The presentation looks different from other yelp photos. I guess it depends on what fruit toppings they have available. I wasn't asked for any choices, they just came out with blueberries. Overall the food is just okay, like I said nothing that would want me to come back.This is my first Sunday Brunch that I felt I didn't enjoy my whole brunch experience at all. I think the food is a bit over priced too. I don't mind spending my hard earned cash for good food but I also expect  a total good experience in trying out your restaurant. I really hope SERVE could thrive in the brunch scene.  The potential is there but just not today.
