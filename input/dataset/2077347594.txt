I booked a session and decided to also use my coupon for free Easter collage. The girl told me it would take 45 min to print. Showed up 45min later and I guess they were having issues formatting it to print out correctly. Hour and a half total spent waiting and the guy kept saying if you wait I'll give a free print. I had already waited hour and a half along with session time and a five month old wasn't going to deal with it much longer. I don't travel to chandler often and live 30min from this location. I told them they needed to mail it to me and I left furious. Never again!Update: The area manager did contact me and had my missing photos mailed and also had one of them framed for me.
