I love poking around in here, but I didn't love the experience at their last bag sale. For the uninitiated, a bag sale means a shopping event where you are given a plastic bag, and from a certain section of the store (usually out-of-season stuff), you can fill it up for $20.Unlike other locations that hang up the clothes, the Bloor-Bathurst location unceremoniously dumped everything in a few plastic bins. Very unpleasant, messy, and inefficient to dig through these with other shoppers. In addition, we all found it frustrating that at this location, one of the staff members refused to let customers try on any of the bag sale clothing before buying it. I get that a bag sale is like a clothing buffet for $20, but honestly, when customers get rebuked for even thinking of trying a pair of jeans on, something is definitely wrong. They've got some good stuff, but the manager should definitely have an extra person on staff during the bag sale so that we can try before we buy. We're not made of money; that's why many of us are shopping there in the first place. Honestly now.
