Took my car in for service at Berge and had a horrible experience. This was the first time I have used the dealership and was completely disappointed with the whole event. Not only did they not repair my car properly they provided zero help in a solution. They were rude and took every opportunity to bad mouth the dealership i bought my car from. What should have been a simple CV boot repair has left me stranded with no car for the weekend and will either cost me a full day of work or the cost of a rental car. Not including the aggravation of dealing with their poor customer service. I know VW is better than this, I have owned 6 VW's in the past 10 years, and in a bad economy this kinda of service will severely  damage a reputation. From now on I will drive the extra 50 miles round trip to have the service department at camelback VW work on my car. They have always provided awesome service.
