Wow, can't believe someone gave this store such a terrible review. The hole in their bag of dog food was obviously an accident and not intentional. I have been purchasing from Choice Pet now for years and find their staff to be friendly and knowledgeable. As for the prices. if you feel they are too high, don't shop there! I give them a thumbs up for their courtesy to us and our dog whenever we come in!
