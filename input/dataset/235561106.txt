I was pretty interested when I went here with my co-workers.  The concept was definitely cool and the food looked good in the pictures.  I ordered the Hengrenade Chicken w/ rice and got a drink.  When I went to get the fountain drink, I pushed the ice dispenser in and a dead cockroach fell out into my cup.  I dumped the cup out and made sure it was a roach (and it was pretty big).  I told a lady at the front what happened and that the cockroach is still there.  She was like "Oh sorry, they just sprayed".  Great, so did they spray RAID on the ice or something?My wife is a chef and I'm pretty sure when someone reports a violation you're supposed to do something about it, at least empty the god damn ice dispenser.  I wasn't really quiet about it either, other customers heard me say it and came up and asked me about it.  She gave me a new cup and I got ice from the other dispenser.  A few minutes later, I saw a cook come over and use a napkin to remove the dead roach from the fountain drink tray and put it into the garbage.I got the food and it was ok.  The lady who brought us the food (not the lady I reported the problem too) was super nice and funny.  I think the roach thing ruined it for me though.  The food wasn't anywhere close to perfect, but it wasn't bad either.  The cookie was REALLY good though
