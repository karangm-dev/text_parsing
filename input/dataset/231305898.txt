This must be one of my favourite Italian spots: authentic, consistent, hitting the spot every time, with every dish.  I must have visited Fusaro's at least a dozen times by now and I feel fully confident to recommend this place to anyone craving Italian.Dishes are reasonably priced for the quality of food you get and portions are very generous. Pastas are served with bread and paninis come with small salads. My favourite items on the menu are Acritano Pasta (chicken+mushrooms+cream sauce) and Rucola Pizza. The only thing that I probably won't order again is gnocchi but not because there's something wrong with the dish; it is just sort of plain/boring to me.
