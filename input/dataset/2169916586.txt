I used to stop in over a year ago after the ballet or symphony and found it a pleasant experience. Since moving back, I tried it several times again and found the experience pretty bad. I like the atmosphere but the service was terrible both times. Will try again someday in the distant future  when hopefully things will improve again. There are far more better places in downtown Pittsburgh that seem to appreciate their customers. I can excuse most things but not unnecessary rudeness.
