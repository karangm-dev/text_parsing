So very happy with Petiquette! I was a first time customer with my young, male, long hair cat. Needless to say, I was nervous!The owner brings his own cats in for grooming so I immediately felt better.Super nice folks working here & my cat looks great!He wasn't upset or anything.I will definitely return.
