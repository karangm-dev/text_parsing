Dr.Romine is wonderful. However if you ever have to interact with Riley the woman that does the laser skin procedures I highly suggest going elsewhere. She was rude, abrasive, and poor communicator from day 1. I came in for a spot on my face that had been there since last year. She set up a series of procedures and did not realize until the 3rd one (2 wks apart each, costing $100) that was not the treatment I needed. She never seemed to recall our initial consult and concerns and was so wrapped up in "knowing it all" and attitude she never took the time to listen to the patient and what the presenting complaint truly was. The incorrect treatment was for depression or differences in the skin texture of a scar and did nothing for the actual problem, her excuse being I termed it "a scar" so that's just what you get. They are the professionals and they should know what treatment to recommend and that the brown pigment was the initial complaint which I said several times since I walked in the door. To top off the attitude every time we spoke- she canceled an appointment the day before which I had planned for over a month and was the only day until November I could do it because of the down time after. When I walked in for the appt and asked why the law was in place (doctor suddemly not in the office building that day so she couldn't do it) she just stated I don't break the law for a procedure instead of explaining the reason behind it.  Extremely poor commuunication and listening skills- highly suggest going elsewhere!!
