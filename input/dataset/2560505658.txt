We had a great steak dinner and decided we wanted some ice cream! I found this place on yelp looking for dairy free ice cream options. This place was amazing. They gave us samples of everything so we could make our decision. I can only describe the ice cream as green tea matcha meets ice cream! I'm pretty sure we'll make this a regular stop when we're back in town.
