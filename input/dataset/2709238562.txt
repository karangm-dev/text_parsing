Waited several minutes for the hostess to show up at the podium to seat us. Once she showed up, she had an attitude!  We told her we'd like a booth for 2. She said, "fine it'll be 5 minutes."  I'm said REALLY!! The place was nearly empty!! We told her we'll go somewhere else. She again "fine ". That young lady just cost the server and the company money!!!
