Update on my review from July....Panini Bread has the most amazing food.  Everything I have ever eaten here has been freshly made, customized to my requests (if needed) and at a price that makes eating out both healthy and affordable.  This has become my favorite go to place for a lunch during work hours and I have even brought in the family a few times on the weekend.The owner and his employees absolutely care that you enjoy your meal and they get to know repeat clients with a friendly face each time they see you.  I cannot say enough how good the food is and I am glad I went back and discovered more of what they have to offer.
