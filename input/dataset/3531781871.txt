DON'T STAY HERE IF YOU LOVE YOUR PET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Me and my husband stayed here 12/27/2014 and our beloved family dog went missing being gone from the room for just an hour granted he is a very smart dog and let himself out of the room but they employee's saw him in their courtyard some said for almost an hour and didn't even notify the lobby to find out which guest he belonged to and to make it even worse one of the men that worked there told me husband he let the dog out of the iron gates of the courtyard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!       So then we were searching the streets of Las Vegas all night long looking for our dog which they didn't help with at all nobody even offered to look,  so needless to say we never even slept in the room because we were looking for our dog and while I'm crying and calling out for my dog several of the employee's showed their unprofessionalism by Laughing at me including their Security!!!!!!!!     WE WERE VERY LUCKY TO HAVE FOUND OUR DOG BUT IT WAS WITH NO HELP FROM THESE PEOPLE IF ANYTHING THEY MADE MATTERS WORSE AND BESIDES THAT WE WERE CHARGED A PET FEE EVEN AFTER THEY HELPED OUR DOG LEAVE THEIR ESTABLISHMENT AND CHARGED FOR A ROOM WE WERE IN FOR AN HOUR!!!!!!!!!!  PLEASE STAY AT ANOTHER HOTEL OR DON'T BRING YOUR PETS WITH YOU BECAUSE THEY CERTAINLY WILL NOT CARE IF HE/SHE GOES MISSING.   OH, ALMOST FORGOT IT WAS 40 DEGREES OR LESS AT THIS TIME AND WE DIDN'T EVEN RECEIVE A BLANKET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
