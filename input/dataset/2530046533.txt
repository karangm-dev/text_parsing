omg!  food not bad, good egg drop soup, but dayum, they sure are rude here.  i walked in with a friend, all staff ignored me until a lady came over and says "wat u want"   not a please or a thank you...if you can put with the fact that this place treats you like thye are doing you a favor by serving you, by alll means, stop on by !  ps, food served on paper plates
