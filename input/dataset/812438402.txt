This place was busy and looked like it had possibilities.  They really tout their Bacardi Rum lineage too.  My spouse and ordered different Rum Bowls. I had the sofrito pork bowl and she had the jerk chicken.  I also added the optional fried egg on top of mine.  Both came with beans and rice.  The portions are certainly generous.  That's where the good news ends though.  Both dishes had a sauce base of a thick, bland flavorless tomato sauce.  It was like something straight out of a can.  I added tons of hot sauce to no avail.   No heat, spice or flavor to be found in both.  To add insult to injury, the egg was fried hard and burnt.  The server was also MIA.  Take my advice, fly on by....
