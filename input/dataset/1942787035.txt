Awesome place! I can't wait to go back! Yesterday, July 3...After a long walk with the puppy at Frick Park, we were planning on going  back to Oakland for bubble tea, and passed this place with their sign posted on the sidewalk said "milk tea" ...WIN! After I parked the vehicle, I looked them up on Yelp, saw their menu and pics of their food...WIN! I gave them a call to see if they had outdoor seating because we had the dog, and...WINNN! We took a seat at the table, the AWESOMEST, super nice, friendly waitress came out with menus and water for us AND the dog...WIN! The food on the menu sounded so good, we make our choices, ordered our bubble milk teas. The waitress kept the cups full and the puppy water bowl full...we didn't want for nothing!The food was incredible, I ordered my son take out and my daughter tried the pumpkin custard sticky rice...WIN! Was SO good. My only mistake was not ordering me one. My sons dish was beyond amazing...I wish I could remember what it's called. It is a noodle bowl. That will be what I order next time. Not that my soup wasn't scrum-didly-yumptuous, because it was.We live pretty far away, but as long as the weather is good and outdoor seating is available, we will always have an excuse to go there because we will take the dog to Frick park for outdoor walking fun and top it off with the Thai Cottage for real.I think we are going to make Thai Cottage a long-term habit and summer tradition!
