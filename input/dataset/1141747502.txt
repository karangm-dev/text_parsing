Charter sucks. Their plans are full of hidden fees and the representatives are misleading in what the price will be. I've been told I will not be charged for something multiple times only to end up seeing it on my bill. The technicians are never on time and the internet is consistently failing, even with the upgrade to Spectrum. Actually, I see no improvement in Spectrum at all.
