Fed up with the fake Italian Food this place offers. Ya'll are getting fooled big time in thinking this place has any resemblance to an Italian restaurant. One final attempt today was the Eggplant Parmesan Hero. Well the eggplant was a white color and there was no breading at all on that white eggplant. It was one of the worst versions of this classic I even seen and their chicken parm did equal injustice to that dish a few months back. Not sure what goes on in the back of the kitchen, but I can tell you that I didn't see any Italians back there if you get my drift. The seeded roll with mozzarella cheese became my $8 lunch. Not returning to this place and who the hell wants to wait 30 minutes for a takeout order? They just say that on the phone to give you the illusion that they are high and mighty, like a club with a line outside and no people inside. Uncle Sal's is real better up the street. Later Defalco.Ok...white eggplant does exist, but rare. Still doesn't belong in parmesan.
