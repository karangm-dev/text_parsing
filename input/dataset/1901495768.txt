I love this hotel!  I think it's my favorite hotel in Vegas.  I've stayed at quite a few including MGM, Bellagio, Mirage, Palms Place, and the Four Seasons.  For a weekend of partying it's my favorite.  If I want peace and quiet I'll take the Four Seasons or Palms Place.  It's really modern, relatively inexpensive for my tastes,  separate bedroom, and 1 1/2 bath.  That's really convenient when one of my cheap friends needs a place to crash and I don't want to be disturbed.  Hey it's Vegas, you never know when you may have an unexpected overnight guest.
