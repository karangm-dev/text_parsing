I would NOT recommend this nail salon to anyone. I went here with my mom and sister because we thought we would get a great mani pedi in Scottsdale and were ready to pay top dollar for it. Well we did pay top dollar however the service was horrific. We chose the upgraded pedicure for $45 and all they did was basically massage our legs and feet and paint our nails. There was no cuticle work, no filing no buffing, no cleaning under the nails or the skin around them. The technician kept putting my feet back in the water too and it was cold after about 15 minutes. Afterward she said she didn't want to put my sandals back on because she "wasn't good at it" and didn't want to mess them up so she had me walking around the salon barefoot. They were SO SLOW we ended up leaving before the third manicure because it was taking so long and it was not worth the wait. We came in for mani pedis, 3 pedis 2 manis to 3 technicians and it took over 3 hours!!! My manicure was the same deal as the pedicure, I asked for a gel manicure and all she did was pain my nails with the gel and it was $35. Its all in my cuticles and has chipped not even a week later. The paint is not all the way to edge and she didn't file, buff, clean underneath, or trim my cuticles. When we started she didn't even have me put my hands in water or anything she just squirted some hand sanitizer on them. It was literally the worst mani pedi I have ever had. I will never go back here and I will warn my friends about this place. They are going to need some serious improvements to stay in business. Yikes!
