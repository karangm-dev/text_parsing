Got sucked in by a booth on the strip, claiming they could give me tickets to a show for cheaper if I sat through a timeshare meeting. I was just trying to give my beautiful wife the time of her life for her birthday and was instead stuck in a 4 hour "meeting", if I could even call it that. It was full of hassling and berating, definitely not a friendly environment. They tried scamming me into a timeshare for an interest rate of 17.8%!! After sitting there for over 3 hours, they would not take no for an answer for place that was not worth it. At one point Mr.Spitter yanked a wad of cash out of his pocket and counted it in front of me, claiming I was  cheap for not wanting his disgusting timeshare.What kind of company is this? Definitely the worst time I've ever spent in my life and dampered my whole experience. ONE LIE AFTER THE OTHER, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH TAKE A BREAK TRAVEL!! 4 HOURS AND $76 DOLLARS LOST ON THIS STUPID TIMESHARE DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!
