Oh man. Food was so good. We had the charred broccolini, smoked whole wings, and the meat and cheese plate with the cheddar.Probably the best food I've had in a long time.Beer is excellent also. We had the Saison, session ipa, and farmhouse ipa.Steel some Jalepeno Jelly from their deli and smuggle back home. It's got crack cocain in it! So good!
