Chada does Thai food in a completely elevated but effortless way. I have yet to try something that I did not like. The staff is the most personable group of people. Chloe and Gap are buddies of my boyfriend and I, now, because we just keep coming back to see them! They know us by name and always make us feel welcome with a handshake and a hug. You haven't tried Thai food like this. I've had Lotus of Siam and was not very impressed. The quality of the dishes and the expertise of the servers makes for a truly special dining experience. Chloe and Gap know which wine pairs best with each dish and how every entree complements another. Panang Curry, pork Larb, pork belly Moo Hong... I can go on and on telling you what tastes great, which dishes are my favorite and what you should order... instead, just ask your server and you won't be disappointed.
