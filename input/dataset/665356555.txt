The last few times I have been here the experience has been poor. January I visited the restaurant for a sit down dinner. We got seated in the back and no one came and asked for our order in the 15 minutes we sat there. We finally got up and left. I stayed away until today and order take out. I get home and realized they forget the sauce for my meal. I had to drive all the way back to get there. I asked for a discount but received soup and an egg roll instead. I get home to eat my cold meal and my tasteless sauce.
