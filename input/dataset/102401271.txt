My favorite luxury hotel in LV. The Venetian does an excellent job of making you feel somewhat normal after three nights of manic mayhem. You can't but feel respectable as you nod your head to the doorman, wave your room card, hold your head high to stop it from wobbling and walk straight back to the pool for some more bloody marys and margaritas. Then you can take part in some water aerobics with the other early birds.
