Fair and expense go hand in hand, so the over priced everything didn't surprise me. Is it worth it? Honestly, not unless you get an unlimited ride band. You'll spend more on the other days since you go through tickets fast! I checked online before attending to make sure my oldest daughter could go on rides. She could, but many of the rides marked as ok with an adult weren't when we got there. That was a minor annoyance. The rides were short, despite the fact there were literally no lines. It was opening day, on a Friday, and no lines? I mean, that's fantastic, but also a sign that something may not be right. Staff was generally fantastic, but 30 seconds at best on a $6 ride was excessive. Now let's talk about the fight. I was in the area minutes before it happened and staff ended up telling us to stay put inside the coliseum during it... as it happened directly outside! I appreciate them keeping us safe and informed, but not a great experience. As a matter of fact, a few of the people getting arrested on the news ran through the building directly in front of us! Another reviewer said to leave before night,  and I wish I had that advice beforehand! It's absolutely not a safe place, which explains the heavy police presence all day. To top it all off, getting out after this fiasco was a literal nightmare! Would I come here again? Absolutely not. There are plenty of other over-priced fairs in the state minus the late night thugs!
