Do not book through this service! They have no affiliation with the properties they book so you lose all the advantages of the onsite management. We arrived early (noon) had we booked direct we could have checked in. However having booked via this "service" we are required to wander aimlessly for 3 hours. I'm sure this isn't the only disadvantage we will discover. DON'T DO IT!!!!
