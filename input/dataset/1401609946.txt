I came here last month and didn't have the chance to write my review until now. I honestly have to say that this place has TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. It seems as if the workers, (especially the girls) likes to insult customers a lot. Loud enough for me to hear at least. It was a few of them that were near this one guy who had earrings I think? These girls have no right to be stuck up. I don't know what makes them think there superior to others. Who ever is in charge of hiring workers there needs to learn how to find better people. It's quite sad that these workers think they can insult customers who are actually helping them make sales. Very immature.
