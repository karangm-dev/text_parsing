visiting from New Jersey this week and wandered into Hurley's because i love Irish pubs. Went to two other ones in Montreal first and they didn't compare. Rod was a terrific bartender and incredibly friendly. The beer is about $8 a pint but that's worth it for the authentic feel of Ireland! I was in Ireland last year and this place really was like hanging out in Dublin. We were at Hurley's twice this week because we enjoyed it so much the first night. Highly recommend!
