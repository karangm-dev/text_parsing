I read all the reviews and I was expecting great food but the food was just ok. The service was awesome though. My dad was in town visiting and I figured I would take him here. We ordered Pad Thai, another noodle dish, and a soup, and all were nothing special. Honestly they were all too sweet. By the way, the food came out way too quick, like we only waited 7 minutes after ordering, and the food was out. I honestly don't mind waiting a while a good food. I felt bad that my dad didn't like the food too much. I noticed they do a lot of take out orders. There were a couple of other patrons in the restaurant but it was pretty empty.I doubt I will be returning anytime soon.
