I went into this establishment this morning with a coworker to grab some breakfast before work. And as I walked in I noticed everyone behind the counter seemed to have an attitude. I ordered the biscuit and gravy platter with eggs and the cashier didn't make it with eggs we noticed while we were paying so he rang up the eggs separately. The eggs came out way before any of the other food so they were cold by the time the rest of the food came out. my friend asked if there was syrup and butter in the bag and the gentleman stated yes but then when we got to work there was no syrup or butter. My overall experience of this place was poor the food was mediocre at best. I will not be back.
