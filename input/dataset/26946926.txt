Excellent customer service. There was a mix up with our carry out order, but we were offered complementary drinks while we waited for the cook to make our food fresh. We were also given a nice little discount (we didn't ask!). The girl working there was super nice and accommodating. Also, the food was amazing! Very pleasant experience.
