Horrible customer Service.I called the Chandler Cigna to make an appointment with my doctor Veravali. They had nothing available with her until 4-5 weeks from my call. I simply needed to get the biometrics form signed (for work benefits), did not want to wait that long. Lady on the phone suggested I go to the "Baseline" location. I said - great! The next appointment available was in 5 days. I was very pleased. Now the day of my appointment, I go to 1920 Baseline Rd, just like the lady on the phone told me to.  Well... I get there and there is no Cigna center; apparently, there is another address 1920 Baseline rd in Tempe... Now, I drive all the way to Tempe from Mesa. Still get there by my appointment time, but by the time I walk in and wait behind a guy who is arguing about his billing, it's now 6 minutes past.  Guess what - they tell me "you're late and the nurse will not see you"....... I actually giggled, I honestly thought the lady was joking (especially after I just told her what I went through and how the address given to me by the Cigna Center employee was in the wrong location). Nope, she wasn't kidding. She told me I had to reschedule, that they couldn't see me today. Here I am: drove from Chandler to Mesa, then Mesa to Tempe and back home to Chanlder.... And then, I thought, let me call The Chandler location, I know they will make this right. Nope, I called and they told me they don't have anything until late October.... So, I'm gonna enter this same review under all Cigna Centers, because they all suck pretty bad....
