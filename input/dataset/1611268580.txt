Had a small misunderstanding with a service advisor so I spoke with CJ, the service manager. CJ was very understanding and corrected the issue right away. CJ offered us 100$ off a light bar for the inconvenience. The appointment was supposed to be 4 hours. At 5.5 hours I called and they said it would be another 1.5 hours. I would have like a phone call if your going to be 3 hours late on my vehicle. Brought the truck in at 830 and got it back at 1630. I will not be using them for anything again.
