This place is amazing! It's definitely one of my favorite vegan-friendly places to eat at in Pittsburgh. I love the concept for this restaurant. It's always fun to eat with strangers and you're in this amazing antique store, so there's lots to look at! The food is superb. The buffet is amazing in and of itself, then you get a whole table of cake, plus your meal choice from a separate list! It's incredible! The staff is also super friendly. I would definitely recommend this buffet place to anyone! Be sure to get there early, as there is usually a line and parking can be difficult to find.
