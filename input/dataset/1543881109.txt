I come to this McDonald's often because they are only a mile from my house. They really care about fast service, but that's it. The drive-thru is always speedy, but they never verify your order at the first window when you pay. They're always taking orders and trying to move the line through, so my order is almost always wrong when I get to the second window for pickup. I care less for speed and more for the right order, espically when I'm just passing through on the way to work. The first time they got my order wrong they just gave me the correct order free of charge, which was nice. The second time this happened they had me wait around the side of the building, but it got so busy they forgot about me. I had to drive through the drive-thru lane again to pick it up. Definitely late to work.Overall, it's not too bad. They're pretty fast,  but they'd probably save their workers and customers more time and efficiency if they just took the extra minute to go over the order again at the first window to avoid this problem.
