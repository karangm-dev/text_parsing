Sushi Rock is one of those trendy places you end up eating at multiple times.  It's like the first place that pops into the minds of people who have never had sushi but think it would be fun to try.  Thankfully I now know enough of other sushi places in the area that I can steer these people in another direction.Every time I eat here I get sick to my stomach within a few hours.  As in, rushing home and cancelling plans or driving really fast on the way back because I need my home bathroom NOW.  I wouldn't be so graphic if it weren't for the fact that this has also happened to friends of mine, and that I know from extensive adventurous eating sushi consumption that this is NOT at all normal nor some sort of intolerance I have for sushi.  Heck, I'm the queen of rare steaks, ordering tuna spine marrow up at the bar (at another sushi place), and "it's probably fine if you just microwave it" and I refuse to eat here ever again.I don't know what the problem is--poor fish quality, issues in the kitchen, etc.--but maybe it's not an issue all the time, which is why some people seem to like it.  Or they have stronger stomachs than mine.  But it's happened enough times it's no longer just coincidence.
