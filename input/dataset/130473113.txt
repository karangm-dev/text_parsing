This is by far the best BBQ spot in the entire Metro Phoenix area, likely the Valley... HOWEVER... They need to make some major operational changes. For starters, there is nothing more frustrating than being hungry, having nowhere to park, waiting for over an hour outside in the az heat, only to be told that they are out of most of their meat, usually the lean & fatty brisket and pastrami, all before 12:30 pm. I understand that people often line up before they open and purchase meat by the pound, which then leaves customers who want to eat lunch, SOL. If they simply required orders by the pound be placed 24 hrs in advance, they're pit master would be able to account for the next day's large orders. Thus, allowing them to provide eat in lunch customer a more pleasant experience. They could even have a separate pickup "window" for orders by the pound. Additionally, streamlining their checkout process could save customers hours, yes hours from waiting outside in the heat. They have continued to run this business the same way they did when they first opened their doors, which, to most is wonderful in that it feels very personal, however, they're far too popular at this point to do EVERYTHING the same. We love this place, we wait in the heat, and we'd never want the quality to suffer, but neither recommendation would hurt what so many love about this place!
