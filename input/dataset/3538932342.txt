Womens bathroom is very clean, I don't know about the mens! I recommend you all to lock your doors at night because there are some weird people who walk around the parking lot at night! We were on a road trip and pulled over to this travel plaza to sleep. Was ok but I recommend you park your car next to other cars. Other then that there is a Mexican restaurant that is open 24/7 inside next to a subway and a coney island! If you must go use the bathroom in the middle of the night you might want to take a pepper spray while walking through the parking lot! Just in case! Or go in a group! There are some nice and old showers! I was lucky enough yo get showers 8 & 9 and they are both the newer, nicer and clean ones! The guy at cashier is very nice too!!
