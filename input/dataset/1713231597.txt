This is the most terrible Mexican restaurant I have ever been to. I mean how can you ruin Mexican?, it's Mexican. If I hate this restaurant so much then why did I rate it 2 stars? Well first of all, they gave us food so that is a 1 star,  then they have a decorated restaurant so there goes 1 more. It wasn't bad experience though it was just bad food. It had music it had people just not enough staff. Now let's talk about the food. First things first. The appetizer which was chips and salsa. Can't go wrong with that right? Well this is what I learned, you can go wrong with that. Salsa was bland and chips had no flavor whatsoever. Then the food , only thing that my family liked about that was the cholula. Terrible. No flavor. I recommend that you do not go to this restaurant if you don't like things with no flavor!
