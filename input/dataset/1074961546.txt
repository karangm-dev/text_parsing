Oh my, so good!  Their Big Wac is amazing.  My husband who is a legit meat eater was in awe of the taste and how it literally was better than a Big Mac.  My toddler gobbled up the chicken nuggets, more so than "real" chicken nuggets.  I think I drank a gallon of the elderberry tea.  Everything was so darn good.  I only wish there was one closer to me in the East Valley (open one in Gilbert!).  I can't wait to go back!
