I had the crab benedict with a caramel cappuccino. My husband ordered the three eggs breakfast with endless mimosa and our 7 year old son ordered cinnamon  rolls and a massive side of bacon. We loved Diego-one of the staff. He noticed our son had a'just-woke up' attitude so he decided to put a huge smile on his face with a sundae. We are definite fans of his hospitality. He was not the main staff but he really was awesome. Now...the FOOD-  yes...loved everything...we will be coming again and again and again...
