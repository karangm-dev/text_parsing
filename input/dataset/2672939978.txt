Came here for breakfast with a few friends and we all loved it.  I had shrimp and grits and it was amazing.  Perfect amount of spice and just enough sauce.  Service gave this place the 5th star and the food was a 4 star.  We will definitely be coming back to this place and possible making this a weekly meal.
