I am pretty patient guy when i take a cheap flight but allegiant is by far the worst company i have ever flown with.Way to vegas from junction plane was 1.5hrs late then leaving vegas to grand junction we were told we had to board an hour early. Then we didn't leave until scheduled time. Sat on the tarmack for 40 min because the proper paperwork to take off was not done with the airport. Of course the A/C didnt work. Ready for take off and now the hydraulic light issue causes us to change planes.   Not bad enough? Flight attendants were so  rude on both flights. Next time i will pay the $100 more. They obviously dont care
