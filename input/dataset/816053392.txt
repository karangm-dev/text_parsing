Of all the buffets at the casinos in Vegas, this is the worst yet...not bad, but there was a re-occuring theme of just-ok-ness throughout the meal. I'm referring to the overcooked cuts of meat, crappy dessert selection, cold food (when it should have been hot) and most of all, the lack of labeling the food stations (which pissed me off the most). It was aggravating to have to go to the front of the lines just to see what the food was or to view the itty-bitty food description signage.I will say, good selection of shrimp.
