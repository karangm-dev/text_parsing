amazingggg took forever to get here. got 2 1/3 pound and a 1/2 pound. $20.50 oy soo expensive. but hey thats poke anywhere. if u get the poke with shoyu sauce. get it on the side. i got in on it and it was drenched and was too much. the ahi with spicy mayo was the best. ill come back but ya poke is expensive.
