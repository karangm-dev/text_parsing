If you like bed bugs in your bed, uncleaned rooms, and house keeping entering your room over and over again when you have the "Do not disturb" sign, than this is THE hotel for you!This has been one of my worst hotel experiences!!! I checked in really late on Wednesday night and just went to bed so I didnt notice that there was dust all over the room. I also got another surprise in the morning, as I had bed might bugs ALL OVER MY LEGS!!!! It was apparant that this room was not cleaned for a long time. I called and asked to have my room cleaned and to change the bedding. This request was ignored, so I called again to show them the bedbug bites and security came and changed my room. Then I came back later in the evening and noticed that housekeeping had gone in my new room even though I had the do not disturb sign up. And then this afternoon after an 8 hour meeting I decided to take a nap. With the do not disturb sign up, housekeeping kept knocking and knocking on my door and then tried to open the door. When I called and complained about them not coming in when the do not disturb sign is up, they told me "we will tell them not to come in when the do not disturb sign is up"... really??? Is it just me or isnt that a GIVEN??? So if you plan on walking around your room not dressed, or want to have sex or take a shower or sleep, dont be surprised (or upset) if the employees come in - cause apparantly entering guest rooms anytime is part of life here! I stayed here 3 weeks ago and no one from the hotel has called me back. I had left voicemails for the GM, the Director of House Keeping and the head of security. It's a real shame cause the hotel location is great. I have to go up to Canada again and stay there for a few weeks with my colleagues but I will make sure none of them stay here!
