Omg.. this place seriously  got me sick after i ate the chicken. It tasted a bit funky and i didnt eat all of it but i had to go to the bathroom many many times that same evening.  I will never  go here again. I literally  had nothing  else that day. I had the food  here for lunch and was nauseous  by dinner time. isnt the health dept supposed  to prevent stuff like this?  I mean obviously  not every restaurant  is  gonna end up being completely  sanitary.  So, that is why there is a  health  dept.I wish I  could  give  zero stars
