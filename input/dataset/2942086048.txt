Well.. Firstly you have to take 2 shuttles to get to the car rental place. In case you aren't aware, some states (Nevada) apparently are a no fault state - driving/accidents - so they require you to purchase additional insurance regardless if you have full coverage through your own insurance company!! Next if you have any issues and you call them directly they do NOT answer and DON'T call you back! We had rented a car, the next morning shortly after driving the check engine light came on and I called 2 times and emailed them. They never contacted me at all!!! When we dropped off the car we made them aware of the situation and their response was "I'm NOT worried about it"!!! Thank GOD we weren't stranded on the side of the road. Never offered any suggestions or  compensation for the stress or hassle during our time there. NEVER WILL I RENT FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN OR THROUGH a 3rd party online site! The number on the contract wasn't the correct number either.. Very poor customer service!!!
