I love Lush products! So when Jessie and I heard they were doing a grand opening of the new Lush store at Ceasers Palace we Rsvped. We showed up right after their 11am opening. The store was pretty busy, but they had plenty of people ready to help you. I actually had something to return. I had purchased Angels On Bare Skin (a face wash) and it turns out I'm allergic to the lavender in it. Janea was super helpful. I explained to her what happened and that I just wanted to exchange it. She also helped me pick a new face wash. Janea even did a little demonstration on my hands using the face wash and a couple other products. Plus, she helped me find the perfect face moisturizer. It was great that she gave me a sample of the moisturizer to try at home. Because it was the grand opening they had fruit kabobs and fruit juices. It was super cute that each juice was named after a Lush product.This Lush is just like every Lush I've gone to as far as customer service. It's beyond amazing! Everyone is so friendly and are very helpful. You can tell they really love the product they sell. I love the set up of the store too. They have a facial bar where you can smell & touch the face masks. They have a wall of bath bombs and a whole table of hair care items. Definitely glad to have another Lush store open in Las Vegas. I always love shopping there. From their products to the staff it makes for a wonderful experience that makes you want to go back for more.
