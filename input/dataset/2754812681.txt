Okay, I know this is supposed to be the "cheap" restaurant in the Wynn, but we're still talking about $18 burgers for lunch, so cheap is relative.  We waited 35 minutes for our food, and of course they got our order wrong.  Did I mention that the place is like half full.  Good thing it wasn't busier, then we might wait an hour for the wrong order.They of course add 18% for parties of 6 or more so great!  I get to way overpay for the wrong food.  I got lazy and didn't want to leave the resort.  Bad call there.
