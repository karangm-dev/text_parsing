Carlos, our server, was very friendly and professional. It was nice to sit out on the patio (place was packed for dinner at about 6pm on a Wednesday night). We just ate the food, really good, so I can't comment on the beverage options. Trendy decir and great location (will probably need to park in one of the bigger parking lots).
