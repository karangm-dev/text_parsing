DO NOT TAKE YOUR DOG here to be groomed.  One month ago I paid $50.00 to have my French Mastif groomed.  One nail on my Dog's paw was cut too short and was bleeding.  Today I took my dog and they charged me $70.00.  I asked why the difference in price.  They said based on Dog's breed, size and weight.  Hmmmm...The dog did not grow or gain weight since the last time.  The girl behind the desk stated well maybe your dog  had matted hair?  My dog has short hair and stays in doors.  Not possible.  On top of this they never brushed the dog's hair out.  The dog is shedding all over my car.  I called to voice my disappointment.  I was blown off.  No call back.  If you want to be over charged for less than average service than this is the place for you.  Fool me once shame on you...fool me twice shame on me.  I will never use this service again.  Horrible .
