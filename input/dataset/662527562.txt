My wife and I stayed at the Bellagio for two nights, and on our last night we did the Buffet at Bellagio for dinner. We had a 2 for 1 coupon, and I am glad we had that deal because it was an average buffet at above average prices. There were single parts of the buffet which were delicious, like the sushi bar and the desserts. Nothing else really stood out, which was surprising to me because they were serving Kobe beef and crab legs(which we came to find out were served cold). We both agreed the best buffet we've had was at the Rio, definitely more bang for the buck there.
