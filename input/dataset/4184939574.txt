Slowest and worst customer service EVER. ALWAYS under staffed always SLOOOW. I am standing in line now theu have been open since 7 am it is 7:10 there are over 10 people checked in at the keyosk and on line waiting for vitals to be taken. There are three  people at the vitals station and they are all talking amongst themselves as 12 people are now in lone waiting. ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. They have the monopoly for 2 reasons. We are need the money that badly in this economy and they are the only facility in this area. Shameful.
