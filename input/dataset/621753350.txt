As many other reviews have said try to avoid this Best Buy if you can.  I have had many bad experiences from floor sales people ignoring customers to outright rude customer service.  Today I spend over 15 minutes at the checkout counter waiting on someone to bring a Nintendo DS to the cash register.  The "stock room" never did answer the pages so the cashier had to go get the item.  Asked to talk to the manager and Kurt came up and asked me "whats the problem?"   Explained to him the problem today and past experiences and he told me thier store gets excellent customer service ratings and "my problems" must be because it is the holidays.  Well Kurt - it wasn't busy when I was there and if this is how you treat customers I will gladly shop on Amazon where things cost less and someone delivers the product to my doorstep in a day or two.  Perhaps when Best Buy closes a store that values thier customers will take the excellent location in Summerlin!
