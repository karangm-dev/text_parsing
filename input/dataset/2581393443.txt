I would rather eat frozen pizza!  I got the serious slice.  I went with plain old cheese because I figured who can mess that up?  Well, apparently they were up for that challenge. If there was sauce on the crust (which was honestly the best part of the pizza) I couldn't find any!  It was completely dry and I couldn't find the cheese either.  I use to have lunch here at my previous job and always enjoyed it but apparently they have a new "chef" or have just given up.  I gave two stars because if you are looking for quantity for a decent price you will get that. But if you are looking for quality... Keep driving down the road.
