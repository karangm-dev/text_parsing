I lived in the Claybourne for a year. The apartments and area are really nice. That being said, like the other reviews, the problem is the management. A woman named Gina is the property manager of the Claybourne. She is a criminal and will do anything to steal your money. I've never seen such greed and stupidity at a professional level. She's a complete imbecile and will do anything to claw every penny from you. Her alone is not worth living here. Stay away from this apartment until she is hopefully fired.
