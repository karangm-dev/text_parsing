Went for an anniversary dinner and it was perfect. We got the chef's tasting which was 6 courses of local and fresh ingredients. While some would consider it costly it is a great experience and by the end of the meal the portion sizes proved to be perfect if not slightly too much. The service was good, knowledgeable, and helpful. I would highly recommend this for couples or groups looking for a great food experience without being overly hipster.
