I would highly recommend this locksmith to anyone! The quote was direct and all inclusive with no funny business. John came out within a reasonable time and was quick (and I got two new keys).  Other companies I was calling were charging a "service" fee to just drive out, then I would get a quote once they got here.  No thank you to hidden fees and charges! Thank you Bell Lock & Safe!
