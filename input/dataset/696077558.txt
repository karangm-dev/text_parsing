Very disappointed!  We flew from LAX to Las Vegas.  Our flight to Las Vegas was delayed 2 hours due to "mechanical problems".  I accept that happens every know and then so no big deal.  On the way back, the flight was delayed 2 hours, again.  I was told, again, that it was mechanical problems.  How many planes do you have with mechanical problems??  I called customer service because I had to be home promptly and was told that the delay was due to weather - what?  Thought it was mechanical problems.  Asked if I would be refunded my fare if I decided to drive home because I could not be home as late as my new departure would put me at.  I was told no refund but they would agree to waive the $100.00. cancellation fee. Horrible customer service and flight attendants all had attitude.  When we landed in LAX the pilot apologized for the delay and told us that all flights had been delayed that day - great!
