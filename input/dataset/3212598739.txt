I've finally checked this place out.The lineups are usually insane, so I've normally walked in, and immediately walked out. I hapened to be walking by at 2pm, and it was empty enough that I thought I'd give it a try .... I got the lunch 'deal' - 1/2 sandwich, small soup - i opted for the turkey BLT and mushroom soup. Oh, I also go the peach iced tea & and a butter croissant.  $17 later ... Turkey BLT - Had it on the multi grain bread. (choice of multi, whole wheat and white). The bread is cut literally over an inch thick. I'm not a bread person, so I ended up taking the top off. That's when I got to see what was really in the sandwich. Then when i did an internal 'oh, so sad'. :( 1 piece of turkey bacon, cut in half to make it look like 2 pieces. An unripe slice of tomato (I took it off - unripe tomatoes are a huge peeve of mine), a piece of romaine lettuce, 2 slices of what look liked turkey cold cut (the same crap I buy at Loblaws). Mushroom Soup - errr YUCK? (can i say that?) There's a weird ... sweet (?) flavor that I just don't like. Had a few spoon fulls, and just couldn't stomach it. I'm sorry, it just wasn't good. (And I love mushrooms) Croissant - it was good. Nice and flaky, which I can appreciate. Fresh. NOTES: - My best friend said the red lentil soup is the best soup to pick, but to be honest, I won't be returning here. - The prices are insane, and I don't like the thick ass bread. I know it's all fresh, and made to order. But ...I guess it's just not my thing. It's just not special enough.
