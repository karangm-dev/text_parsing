ALERT: This place is dirty and they do not sterilize their instruments!  UNSANITARY!This is the worst place I have ever been.  I went with family members today for a pedicure and let me just say it was a disaster from the moment we walked in.  The chairs only move forward and backwards. The nail tech that did my pedicure did not speak one word to me.  She worked really fast even though no one was waiting. She only cut my nails and filed them and did not do my cuticles at all.  She did a super fast moving leg massage for no more than two minutes and then had me dip my feet into a community paraffin container.  Yuck!  Then she peeled off the paraffin and dried my toes and slapped the nail polish on.  After the coat was applied she just put the topcoat on my big toe and then just touched the bush in a single dot on my other toes.  The top coat didn't even cover the polish.  She got up and I looked at my toes and there was polish all over my skin.  I asked her if she could remove the excess polish and she proceeded to actually strip off some of the polish on my toes.  She got the polish back out and touched up several spots she striped off with the brush.  She said thank you and got up and walked away.  I asked her how much that pedicure was and she said 35 dollars. Not only is this the most unprofessional place I have ever been to but my pedicure was less than 20 minutes at best.  My family members and I will NEVER return to this dump.  As a final note, my polish has chipped off my toes within 6 hours.  DO NOT GO HERE!
