I take back the nice things I said. The NP turned out to be super pushy, couldn't solve an issue I had, and on repeated visits couldn't be bothered to skim my chart to see what she had done and as a result, recommended the same things she had done already. They also won't write for OC for an entire year, requiring you come in for a check-up and exam twice a year, unlike basically every other OB/GYN I've been to (a clear money grab).Left an extra star since if you are a new patient, they can get you in very quickly (in retrospect, a very bad sign....I found a new Dr and it took me over 3 months to finally get scheduled with her as a new patient).
