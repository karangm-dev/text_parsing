Wanted to have some comfort food and have a beer.  I had been to a 3 Brewers in Ottawa and thought this would work. Wow... talk about disappointing.  Walked in, super noisy, and very busy, I see the host and tell her that it's just me. She says, I can sit at the bar and then barely lifts a finger to point in the general direction of the bar.  She hands me the menu and the drink list and I go find a seat.  I get to the bar and was able to order quickly.  I ordered a beer and I thought their beers were much better tasting.  Their version of a stout was really a very watery stout.  I noticed that the bartender was very busy, not only running to serve all the patrons sitting at the bar, but also quite a few tables near by.  I wait for quite a while to get my food, and when it finally comes my fries are luke warm, and the beef dip was very uninspiring.  Beef was dry and I was provided what I'm sure is the smallest sized plastic cup for the Au Jus.  Due to the bartender being busy she didn't come back to ask me if my meal was ok, and had to flag her down to get the pepper, which was behind the bar. Once I was finished it took a while to get my bill.  Noticed others waiting as well.Overall, I have to say that this was sup-par, service, and food.  I had been to another 3 Brewers with much better experiences.  I'm not coming back to this one.
