I CANNOT BELIEVE THE DISRESPECT AND AUDACITY OF THIS PLACE!!I NEVER GIVE THIS BAD OF A REVIEW AND I NEVER HAVE BEEN AS OFFENDED AS I HAVE BEEN HERE. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. SHAME ON YOU FLAVORS, SHAME.My partner and I had bought a groupon for the brunch buffet here, which we were excited for. We went around noon, or a little after, when we were stopped by the cashier lady. She told us our groupon was not valid because it was a breakfast option ONLY available Sunday through Thursday (it was Sunday). We clarified that the groupon said it was valid for Sunday, and considering they only offer Brunch and no breakfast option, it must have been valid during Brunch hours, or else why would it be valid on a Sunday....riiiight?! She started to get annoyed and telling us to leave and come back on a day that served breakfast. She also said "YOU WILL NOT FIND ANY BREAKFAST OPTIONS HERE AT THIS HOUR. WHAT TIME IS IT?! DO YOU THINK THERE'S BREAKFAST BEING SERVED HERE? GO AND COME BACK SOME OTHER TIME WHEN ITS BREAKFAST. WHAT YOU PAID ISNT WORTH WHAT WE SERVE FOR OUR BRUNCH BUFFET" Though there is breakfast becuase its brunch.... right? that's what brunch is.. breakfast and lunch. Also, if they didn't want people to purchase groupons and use them for their buffet, why put them on the website?!She kept yelling at us and waving her hands as if to slap my partner. She got so angry, waving her hands at my partners face, that I decided it was time we left.NEVER AGAIN. IF THIS IS HOW YOU TREAT YOUR PATRONS, THEN YOU DONT DESERVE MY MONEY. I SUGGEST EVERYONE AVOID THIS PLACE. GO SOMEWHERE WITH GOOD SERVICE.
