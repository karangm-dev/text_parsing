Just an overall good place to go for whatever kind of time you're trying to have. It's a much more lively atmosphere than that of most gaming bars in town. The staff there is amazing, Joey, Brian and Chris are all phenomenal bartenders and will always take great care of you. The food is always consistent which means something too.
