They missed the mark! Saw the show in Tampa - I think the first 20 rows may give it a 4-star rating, but for the 11,000 other guests, I'm sure a 2 rating is the accurate rating.It was so boring at times that people a couple rows ahead of me were shopping on their iPad on Amazon!Laser show was impressive; story was bad; needed more 'show' on stage; way too many phony dramatic songs; missing a grand finale.Just some guys wailing on guitars, a violinist, keyboard and drummer.I would be OK if tickets were about $40, but not worth the ridiculous price of the tickets!
