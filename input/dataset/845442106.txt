Service was great, fast, and friendly. But unfortunately the food was just not good. Everything was cooked properly but the the chicken lacked any sort of seasoning and tasted almost identical to frozen tenders you can get from Walmart. Their toast was really just slices of regular bread not even toasted throughly. And their signature sauce was extremely bland. With all the other options around I just wouldn't recommend this place to eat. Possibly if the price was lower it could stand a chance with the nearby competitors but currently it does not.
