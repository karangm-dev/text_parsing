This restaurant is gone from great in the beginning to very spotty in the new and expanded facility.   My wife and I were there on Sunday and found that the food was at best mediocre.  I ordered the RACK OF LAMB and it was over cooked and was mostly grizzle and fat.  My wife ordered the Salmon in a soy sauce served in a clay pot, and the salmon was RAW in the middle when she cut it open to eat it, the rice was not completely cooked and was a skimpy portion.  The only thing that was good was the SPRING ROLLS with PORK.  I found that since the restaurant was expanded the quality and service  is less than expected.  I was a early adopter of the restaurant and made it my home for Vietnamese cooking now I am beginning to look for a better Vietnamese restaurant.  Originally Dennis the owner was very concerned with the quality of the food.  Since the restaurant was expanded, the wait staff is less attentive and the food is now rushed out of the kitchen without supervision.
