I went with my mom to get the amount of rings changed on my grandmother's I phone. It is not as simple as going to settings. You have to do a complex amount steps according to the Internet, so we gave up. We took it to the store and Lyndsay was very helpful and fix the problem. She was great and was very nice. They have been great every time we go there. Five stars for sure!
