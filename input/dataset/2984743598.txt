AMAZING!!!! So so so so so good!! My mom, sister, and I stopped in before we saw a show and all loved our orders. I played it a little safe and got the spaghetti, my sister got the lasagna, and my mom got the burrata agnolotti. We all loved our meals and ate every single bite. The sauce for the spaghetti was so rich and flavorful and although I didn't try their selections my sister claimed it was the best lasagna she's ever tried. It is a little pricey but it's so worth it for the quality of the food and the great service. A must try if you're in Vegas!
