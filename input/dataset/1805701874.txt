Amazing stay! The front desk manager Bjorn was very caring and helpful, customer service was excellent!! Had food at the cafe and gambled in the casino. Room service delivery for take out was hot and very very good! I would highly recommend staying here and look forward to going here two times a year for the NASCAR races. If your looking for a Fancy Vegas type hotel resort near Phoenix with a great casino/ huge pool/ awesome bar/ and cool entertainment you need to check this place out!!
