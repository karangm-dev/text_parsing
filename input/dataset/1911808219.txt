Their specialty dishes are very unique.  The spicy tuna nachos are amazing. Some of my favorites are: lemon roll and the edamame is a must.  For desert also try the chocolate chip cookie with fudge and vanilla ice cream - yummyWe celebrated a birthday in the Tatami room.  Beautiful private room, we sat on cushions  in a very cozy setting.
