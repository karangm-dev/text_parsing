I read some good reviews on this place and decided to give it a try . I was not disappointed ! My son and I really liked the Chicken Fried Steak . You could tell it was handmade with cube steak and not a frozen patty . The cinnamon roll was also homemade with good icing , not too sweat like cinnabon . They also have preserves that are made by the owner , and the raspberry is out of this world . I bought a small mason jar to take home . The biscuits were fluffy , grits cooked just right , and eggs cooked perfectly could have used another one . We will be coming back and looking forward to trying other things . You have to be careful driving here because you will easily pass it as I did , and had to drive back around the block . I recommend you come and the server was very nice .
