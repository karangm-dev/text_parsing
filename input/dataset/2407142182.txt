We cannot thank Dr. Tom enough for saving our girls life. From our first visit with our very ill girl to the last visit, I saw a complete personality change in Dr. Tom. Dr. Tom was so concerned about our girl. When our girl was slowly recovering Dr. Tom was so happy too. This experience made me a true believer in Dr. Tom and his staff/facility.Our dogs are our children. We only want the very best for them. Dr. Tom is now seeing our dogs for their chiropractic needs too. Our dogs have always had chiropractic adjustments since we rescued each one of them. Dr. Tom is fabulous!
