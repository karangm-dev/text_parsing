I did curbside service and they left out part of my order and got part of it wrong. I had to go back for the missing items after being told they would call me back- after being on hold for a while when I called about it I wasn't reassured that I would ever be called back by a manager. I didn't bother to get the other part of the order fixed since by then it was more trouble than it was worth.The food was good but the quality of service can be improved, especially when it comes to putting to-go orders together.
