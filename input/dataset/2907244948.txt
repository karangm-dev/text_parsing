Dig this place.Tried all the other local pizza shops, and this is the only one we have ever ordered more than once from. And we will continue to order from them; they kick ass!Pizza is good. Thin crust, very NY foldable style, not too chewy. Good sauce, cheese and toppings.Salads are awesome here. They must be putting opioids in the lettuce or something, because we have to order one every visit.Wings are also very good. Baked, well sauced and not too oily. Good heat on anything Hot or better.You cannot go wrong for take out here. Best in the neighborhood.
