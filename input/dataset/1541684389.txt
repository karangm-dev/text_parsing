This place is my favorite place in Kent! I've eaten here several times and tried something new each time, and I've been impressed each time. Food is always hot and tastes fresh. Probably would say the best sandwich I've had so far was the BBQ burger one, James Harrison. The place is family owned and are friendly every time I go in there.I wish they could expand to have more seating! Only saying good for groups no due to size inside.
