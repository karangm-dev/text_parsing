I stopped In here the other day because I was in Henderson and found myself hungry. I love the breads at Great Harvest Bread Company so I decided to try them for lunch. Big mistake! I was on the mood for a grilled cheese sandwich so that is what I ordered.  That, however, is not what I received. What I received was a cheese sandwich that had been put through an oven on a conveyer, Albeit the cheese was melted the bread was as white and untoasted as when they sliced it off the loaf. I inquired of the young lady at the counter as to why this was the case, (A grilled cheese should come out with a golden brown, crispy, crunchy and delicious exterior crust. Which is created by the application of butter to the exterior of the bread before you GRILL it.)  I was told that they put there garlic butter on the inside of the sandwich so as not to mess up the grill...what grill? there is only the oven with a conveyor belt. This is inadequate, to say the least. That's fine if you want to do it that way but don't call it a grilled cheese sandwich, it is not!!! Perhaps your employer would think about purchasing a Panini grill or something that would produce the desired exterior. To the young woman who helped me, don't ask me have a had the sandwich here before because clearly I have not! I have a completely different idea of what a grilled cheese sandwich is, as I'm sure most people would. It was not the warm cheese sandwich that I got.I have not any other sandwiches here. I'm hopefully they are better. perhaps I will try again...maybe.
