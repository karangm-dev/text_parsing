Fabulous- here on business and found this gem on Yelp and very glad we did. There were seven of us and were seated immediately with no reservation since it was a quiet Tuesday. The service was warm and friendly and the food excellent. Shout out for the tagliatelle bolognese and the chicken Milanese. We also enjoyed the burrata salad and the chocolate mousse cakeIf I lived here I would be a regular!
