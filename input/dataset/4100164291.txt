I know I probably deserve some hate for rating this place so low for ordering a salmon in an exotic red meat joint; but still, why even offer fish if the same level of attention won't be devoted to it?The appetizer was the special heirloom tomatoes with buffalo mozzarella. Coupled with the pesto-pumpkin seed-olive oil from the bread, this dish was awesome. These were the fruitiest, juiciest tomatoes I have ever tasted. Buffalo mozzarella was top notch too; melted in your mouth.We actually smelled the fishy smell right as the waiter placed the salmon dish on the table. It must have been sitting in that freezer for a good while before they cooked it. The dish was totally sub par, I didn't even finish it. The garlic mash it came with was good but I've had better for the price.So yeah, stick with the antelope.
