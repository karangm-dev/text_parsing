NationsChoice offered the lowest rate on BankRate, but after reading several negative reviews I was skeptical. Joe Garza said he could get my refi done in 30 days and he did it, even after a low appraisal. The entire process was smooth and painless. Joe and Michael Clouatre were extremely efficient, responsive, and professional. I would definitely recommend them to my friends and family.
