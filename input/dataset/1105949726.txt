No idea how this place has such high reviews. Service was friendly, that's about it. The food was extremely slow, took 50 minutes to get our pasta. It wasn't even busy, only two tables inside, and four on the patio, mostly empty.When the pasta finally did arrive, it was watery and bland. Tasted like microwaved frozen dinner. Most disappointing pasta I've ever had.
