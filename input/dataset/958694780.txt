I went in after being sick for 6 days and feeling worse they gave me a strep test and told me I didn't have strep she didn't check in my ears or my nose even though I told her I had congestion and sinus pressure and sent me home with nothing now 9 days later and I'm completely miserable I'm going to CVS Minute Clinic because it's only $15 for me I will never go back here again even though it's right around the corner from my house
