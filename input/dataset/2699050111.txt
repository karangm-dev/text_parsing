Unfortunately, I have to review this franchise negatively. I used Budget Blinds to order a very expensive shade that was perfect for my window. At the time I was pleased with the product and so when I needed some repairs on other blinds, I called again. I was told that my old vertical blind absolutely could not be repaired and would need a new header at the cost of $300 + installation. I was also quoted over $250 to repair a broken wooden shutter. When I questioned the news, Brad was unhappy with me. I got a second opinion and have now had both window treatments repaired beautifully for a total of $134.37.
