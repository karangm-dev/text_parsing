Bad experience in this store, staff is more interested in having personal conversations and ignoring customers. After about 10-15 mins of no acknowledgement I asked a clueless salesperson about a product and she was rude and behaved as if she was being put out by my questions. She was a tall, slightly older black woman and clearly hated her job and was of absolutely no help, avoid her if you visit this location. She clearly had minimal knowledge of the cosmetics and gave me contradicting information on products and all of the other staff members were too busy chatting amongst themselves to be bothered.
