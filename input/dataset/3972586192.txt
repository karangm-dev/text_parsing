We made reservation at 630pm, arrived 620 and waited until 715! All the while I was trying to calm down a hungry toddler. The food was ok, but they kept the internal temperature so high and the fact that the inside was really small made us very uncomfortable. not recommended if you have kids and don't bother making reservations cause they don't seem to care and will not honour it anyways.
