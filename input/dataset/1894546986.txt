Vegans and omnis, do yourself a favor and eat here. The Coronado is a great place to introduce vegan/vegetarian food to your non-veg family and friends, as everything can be made vegan or vegetarian, so they can ease into the foods they're more familiar with (e.g. choice of eggs or tofu, cotija cheese or vegan cheese). It's counter service, so if it's your first time, it's not clear if you order right away or take a seat, but the employees are friendly and seem to recognize right away if you need a little guidance. Every time I come back, I always try a new pastry (particularly a new vegan pop tart) and new entree and I've never been disappointed. Plus, I love that The Coronado doesn't rely on mock meats as a restaurant. While I'm definitely not one to shy away from mock meats, it feels like a more impressive and wholesome dining experience having food THAT good and not needing some version of mock chicken, beef, etc. I guarantee you'll find something you like, whether you swing by for a pastry and coffee or tacos during happy hour.
