Love this place, the owner was born in Osaka Japan then later moved to Korea.What makes this place special is his unique culinary fusion of J meets K.  I have never experienced anything even close. Harumi is likes the ... Roys of Sushi!My wife is from Osaka and she agree's.とてもユニークなレストランですので、一度お試しあれ！！Most of the wait staff are from Japan which adds an authentic touch that is missing from most AZ sushi joints. They also offer Asahi Super Dry from Japan in giant cans,  not that Canadian wanna-be bottled Asahi found everywhere else. Decent selection of cold Saki,  including the cloudy Nigori. Nice!We ordered a double Omakase ... Oh- My- Goshi!  Words cannot to justice for the Sushi ... so here are some pictures.While a more creative nighttime seating arrangement would add to the ambience, nothing is stopping us from coming back.See you there!
