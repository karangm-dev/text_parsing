Beware of these sneaky crooks!!!  I reserved a mid-sized car, given a Chevy Cruise which should be considered Compact and was charged an extra $11.00 per day for class upgrade. They say a Chevy Cruise is considered full-size even though my reservation email says Chevy Cruise ir similar. So when they print out 12 pages of print too small to read you better not sign unless your okay with getting ripped of by Hertz Rent A Car!
