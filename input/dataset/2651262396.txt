It was raining outside and we didn't want to walk in the rain to one of the many ramen shops around so we settled for Liberty Noodle. I wasn't expecting much to be honest, I just wanted to satisfy my ramen craving and this seemed like a quick fix. I ordered the Tonkotsu ramen while my partner ordered the chilli chicken udon. The food was prepared really quick, within two minutes both orders were done and placed onto a lunch tray for us. Both dishes came piping hot. The udon was pretty disappointing and had this really sweet taste to it. The ramen was okay, the broth wasn't salty and had decent amounts of pork belly (3 big slices) but the meat was on the tougher side. Liberty Noodle is an okay choice but with amount of Ramen and Japanese restaurants within a two minute walking distance of Eaton Center, it's better go to one of those restaurants instead.
