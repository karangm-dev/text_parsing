I had a 10PM reservation after a show (At Caesars). The restaurant called me at noon to confirm. I told them I was coming right after the show. The person said that they would note that on my reservation. We walked in at 10:15 only to be told that the last reservation is at 10. We were turned away at our 30th wedding anniversary! This restaurant should honor a reservation after a show, especially a show at Caesars! Never again!!
