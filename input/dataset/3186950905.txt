Great place for team building! Had a good time networking with colleagues! Food was decent. Tried their pickled fried chicken, beef brisket, salad and mac and cheese. Only gripe was the sangria was too light. The coach who trained us did a great job teaching the ropes and you could tell he was passionate about the sport. Overall, highly recommend trying this place out.
