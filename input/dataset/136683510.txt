I have lunch here every time I'm in Montreal.  The onion soup is amazing, and now they even do a mini, which is more than enough for anyone.  I love the side salad, and the dressing--with garlic--that's served along with the crepes at lunch.  Favourite crepes--apples and ice creme, mushrooms and cheese, asparagus. I've always had a great experience (except for the time that I got a ticket on Mentana, that I never should have gotten.  I was totally legal).
