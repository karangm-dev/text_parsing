This was our second time to enjoy this restaurant. We first came for our anniversary then again last night for my wife's birthday. We have such an amazing experience the first time that there was no question where we'd celebrate the birthday.We were fortunate to have Richard as our waiter/concierge (as I like to put it) he is clearly happy to be part of the experience at Cafe Monarch. He is very knowledgeable and helpful and always available without being overbearing. You'll notice I haven't said a thing about the food up to this point. The reason is this restaurant is as much about creating the perfect evening as it is about the food. It is people like Richard who fulfill that mission. Thank you Sir.We got lucky last night as he was with us one more time.The food...I can't articulate how amazing the food is.Simply incredible! On our first visit I enjoyed the Trio and last night the Tomahawk. On your next special occasion, give Cafe Monarch a try. You will not be disappointed
