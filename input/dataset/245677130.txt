Where do I begin? I was admitted in their inpatient program for 7 days for Suicidal thoughts and PTSD. Within those 7 days my wife brought me over 100 dollars in magazines and books to read which the staff lost and wouldn't return her calls to get the refund. Now it's been over a month and not one of the 16 phone calls and 8 emails were returned. Then I started the outpatient program that I wasted 30 days of my life at for Clai the therapist to say She can't treat PTSD and that I just need to get my shit together. Oh and FYI this was after she told me she has a good bullshit meter and that they knew of the suicidal thoughts I had the night before. How she has a job I will never know!! Hope if you are having issues like I have then you will not go there. You may if your lucky get 25mins with a doctor a week. Clai was completely unprofessional and no way should be employed as a therapist. I am active duty military and there are a few others in that program if you can't help ptsd, depression, or suicidal thoughts then you need to resign before you make someone kill themselves. She is going to get someone hurt or worse. If this is how they treat military than by all means brothers and sisters stay away!!!!! Luckily I have a wonderful wife to help who is helping me find the help I need.           UPDATE**** I will never contact this dick face that commented. You guys could give two shits about military and Clai is going to get someone killed.
