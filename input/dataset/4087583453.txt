Well, it's more than a month since I had the tiny beet salad at Tarbells.  In addition to posting it on Yelp, I also put a note on the Tarbell site about my experience.  No response at all from them.  I certainly wasn't expecting a free meal, but it would have been nice if they acknowledged my comment.  Won't ever be going there again.
