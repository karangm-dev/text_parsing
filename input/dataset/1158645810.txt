Don't let the donut in the name of this café scare you away. It is an awesome donut shop, but it is much more.To start with, they are very friendly in a quiet sort of way. All you need to do is sit for a while and watch the steady stream of regulars on a Saturday or Sunday morning to know this café has a loyal following.We were all about donuts on our most recent visit. They have all the flavors you could possibly desire, even bowing to recent trends like a maple long john with bacon. We passed on that choice, instead opting for a heavy dose of rainbow sprinkles. The raised donuts are light, soft and delicious.Consider the Baker's Dozen, a best buy, if you are taking donuts to go. The fourteen count drops the price to about 70 cents a donut, a few cents less than the standard dozen.The diversity of menu offerings will no doubt surprise you. They have an extensive menu of sandwiches, soups, salads, Panini, breakfast burritos, muffins, bagels...They also have convenient group pricing for lunch and breakfast items, so you can bring more than just donuts to the office.Open seven days a week, 5 a.m. to 6 p.m. The folks here are really nice. Give them a try.09/2714 Update: The croissant breakfast sandwiches were delicious (and huge)! More importantly, a very picky coffee drinker in our group LOVED the pumpkin spice coffee and the syrup station. Thought she was going to settle in for the entire day. In an interesting turn of events, the four year old in our party passed on the usual rainbow sprinkles and opted for a glazed red velvet cake donut. And loved it!
