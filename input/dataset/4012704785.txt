This place is really amazing!I am a small asian girl, I am scared of guns and loudness in general. But then, I was afraid of dogs before I got my own. I came to the shop on a Sunday afternoon, wanting to check out some guns for purchase in the future (since I had such a good experience with my dog, lol, i know, ignore me) people there are so helpful and made me feel at home. I can't remember their names, but the guy at the counter gave a lot of good suggestions, he answered all my questions very patiently, and after I picked what I liked, he suggested that I try it out in the range.  The instructor I had in the range was also awesome, he taught me all the basics, and tried to make me laugh so I would relax. Even though I ended up not finishing all my shots (I was too chicken, the instructor did everything he could), I really enjoyed the whole experience. Also, since I didn't finish my whole course, at the check out, they also gave me a huge discount, which was totally not necessary! Before I went to this place, I was a afraid it might be a tourist trap. Although there were quite a few tourists there, there was a lot of locals there too just to shoot. And they definitely seem to get what type of customer you are, if you know what I mean. I will definitely come back to this place for a class, and try to shoot some more. Hopefully next time I will finish my package and buy a gun soon.
