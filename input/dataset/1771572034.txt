Came to have bacon bourbon Bloody Mary at Tom' Urban. At 1100 it wasn't that busy but it took forever to get served at the bar. Ordered signature Mary and it came without half of the goodies. No olive no cucumber no cream cheese on the celery as advertised. We stopped a waiter passing us to see what was supposed to be in the Mary's and he brought us some goodies. Nah to on my top list..... next!
