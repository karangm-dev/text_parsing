This is a stellar spot for Indian food - I'd say one of the best in town. Mark H. and I went out with Gayl and John B. as they were in town visiting from Washington state.  They always research restaurants before coming to Phoenix - gotta find new places to Yelp!  Anyway, this was one of the first places they wanted to try.We had a large number of dishes which John B. ordered (he's British, so I think that makes him an expert on Indian food, since it's the only edible thing in Britain).  I eat spicy food, but I'm not a huge fan of the type of flavor that makes you lick bread or go running for the bathroom.  Maybe because of this, my two favorite dishes were the more mild ones.  If you come here, do not pass up the vegetable korma and the butter chicken.  I could have devoured an entire plateful of both of those dishes.  In fact, I think I did.  They also make a nice iced Indian Chai tea that comes with a free refill.10/10 will be back.
