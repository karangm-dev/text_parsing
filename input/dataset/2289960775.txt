Angry Ale's reminds me of bars I used to frequent when I was in college.  When we didn't have any other choices.  The restaurant/bar is a series of interlocking rooms.  Some with tables, some with bars, some with pool tables.  Great for mingling in crowds.  In college.  We had a coupon for Angry Ale's so decided to give it a try, hoping to find a new local favorite bar at which to hang out.  It was a nice evening, so we sat outside.  They have a big outdoor seating area, but AA was seriously lacking any atmosphere.  No color, no theme, no spark.  The service was a-ok, as was the food.  Nothing stood out.  It's your basic bar food -- apps, salads, burgers, wings, sandwiches -- but they had a pretty good variety of each item.  Maybe if they did something with the look and feel of the place, Ale wouldn't be so Angry?
