I am a Noodle Fanatic!  I was pleased when I drove by to see this new noodle shop.  I was happy to see that they offered noodles and Pho of all types.I didn't know what to expect, but I figured I would try it out.    SO GLAD I DID.Ultra laid back...no frills environment makes it comfortable to "come as you are" to a good dining experience.This is NOT your typical Chinese restaurant where you order by number.  The food is NOT laden with MSG.This is FRESH and FLAVORFUL food!   Warm and hearty for a cold winters night....yet not heavy at all.It is a must try, yall.  I hope that our hood supports this business because It is just plain good!  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.
