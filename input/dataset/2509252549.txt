It's unfortunate that this store is the best in Vegas yet, still the worse overall. You can't get a piece of furniture from this place delivered without it being defective in some way and having to go through having another one delivered a half dozen times before you get one without any issues. The only positive thing is they knock off some money bringing the price down, which is still more than what this crap is worth. And it really is overly priced crap! It's all put together very poorly! Shame on the company for bad business. This will be the demise of their company if they don't change their ways!!! My suggestion, rent a car to CA, go to a furniture store there, and rent a uhaul to bring your furniture back in.
