I met the owners at their home and helped protect their family by setting up a home alarm system for them. In exchange Niko and Ladan invited me to try their restaurant on the house. I did so without hesitation. Was not disappointed. Ordered a full rack of baby backs, half a chicken, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, vegetables, and chicken chili. The ribs were tender and flavorful, the chicken had an incredible smokey flavor, and the sides were amazing. The chicken chili was on point. First time was free and it made me a believe. I will definitely be frequenting the nevada chicken cafe. Thanks Niko and Ladan, I'll see you guys again soon I hope.
