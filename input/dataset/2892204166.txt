A comedy of errors. Beautiful decor and otherwise good service was ruined by 1) overlooked dishes 2) undercooked dishes 3) getting something completely different than we ordered (peppercorn steak is not the same as steak with bearnaise sauce) 4) 3 of the house wines being unavailable 5) still being charged $200 for a terrible meal and 6) having to wait 15 minutes to pay because none of the credit card terminals would work. Eventually, we just left. Truth be told, this restaurant has potential and the staff mean well. Problem is that on the night we visited, they couldn't get their act together and committed the cardinal sin in restaurant management: charging their guests an exorbitant amount for what was  a complete waste of money. We also noticed another table sending food back that same night so there is clearly an issue at this restaurant. Toronto is full of places that will gladly take your hard earned money. I'd recommend steering clear of this place until they get their act together or until it changes ownership again.
