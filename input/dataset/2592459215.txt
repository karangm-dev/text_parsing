Congratulations Alaska Airlines. After not allowing me to check in online you denied me a ticket because I was one minute past the cutoff. I fly all over the world and this happens occasionally but I have never been denied. So I will sleep in the airport tonight when a bit of caring by your personnel could have avoided this. I have flown with you whenever possible but never again.My fault for not knowing the shuttle uses were dedicated to specific terminals
