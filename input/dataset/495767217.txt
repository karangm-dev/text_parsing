This place is always crazy busy! For good reason. I haven't had a bad thing on the menu. Their pizza is magnificent. A bit priecy however for the size. Especially the personal pizza which is way too overpriced to be a single person's meal. The pasta is what I usually get. The Big Rig Pasta is my favorite followed by the pesto drink. The sandwich menu is great for lunch withe The Italian Sausage being my favorite.Come early to get a table since they don't take call aheads or reservations. Indoor seating is nice but a bit noisy, but outside is heated and lovely all the time. The bar is nice here to sit at especially with small parties with always quick and available seating. Come here for good food.
