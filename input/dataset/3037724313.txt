This place SUCKS. My daughter went here on a date and mind you, she's 17. They proceeded to tell her the wait was 2 hours which wasn't a problem because she got there pretty early in the evening. Finally, when she was notified a bay was ready for her and her date, they told her that her and her date couldn't use it because they were under 18. It was 9:00 and all because she was under 18 she and her date couldn't play. Talk about a waste of time. The staff wasn't even decent enough to notify her when she got there. Instead, they made her wait and wasted her and her dates time. WILL NOT GO BACK.
