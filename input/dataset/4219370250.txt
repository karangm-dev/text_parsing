I came in for a foundation that would cover scars, and Valerie at Lanc√¥me made sure everything was absolutely perfect!  She sent me home with a foundation that made my skin look flawless and an incredible exfoliate. She also sent a few samples which I have loved and will absolutely be purchasing.  She is very knowledgable about their products and I was so much more confident when I left and I had a big smile on my face! I was even complimented on my make up from friends and family! Thank you Valerie!
