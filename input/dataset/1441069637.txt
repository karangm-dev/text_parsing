Update:  I went back for more and I feel great!  I haven't had a massage in a long time and now that Coco has been taking care of me, I'm starting to feel better especially after my shoulder injury. I need to get to a point where things aren't so tight and I'm getting there.  I highly recommend.  If you want those knots cleared and get to feeling better, come see Coco or Cindy. :)Thanks you guys!!!!  I appreciate the relief!!!
