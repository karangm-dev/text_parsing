My companion and I went to Living Kitchen on an impulse and am very happy to say it was delicious and worth it! My companion got the Arugula Harvest salad and I got the Pad Thai. The Arugula Harvest salad was very tasty and all of the components came together well. The Pad Thai was also very flavorful and had an awesome sauce which had a good afterburn to it. I would highly recommend coming here to try the food vegan, vegetarian, or otherwise.
