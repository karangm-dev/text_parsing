We have visited this restaurant few times. But recently we have bad experiences . Owner was rude. Also food has become bad.. sambar taste is not good as like before . Dosa batter is not good . Too much salt in some food . I don't know how these people running business with rude behavior and bad quality food . Another thing is food is very costly but quality is not comparable to it . Best thing in South Indian cuisine is sambar but recent sambar taste has gone bad .. I don't know what has happened. We may not visit this restaurant again.
