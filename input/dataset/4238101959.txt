We go out a lot and most of the time it's good but I think lately customer service has dropped. Maridith the manager here did horrible as customer service as well. We had the rewards before with your phone number and I get coupons every month for free chips and salsa but it's never at the time I am going or I delete the e mail. And I asked the server about the ones I found online and she said nope this won't work because it has to have a bar code but you know management can always over ride this. We spent some time finding one with a bar code. And could not so we asked for Maridith and she came over. Not helpful at all. Just said how the new systems for the rewards has changed and if I can't find my account to create a new account. And went on why how this is because the old system only gave you so long to use your points anyways and they's why we should create a new account. Still not working with us to figure out how to get the free chips and salsa. Anyways we complained after just saying hey that's bad customer service and she did it say much but sorry and I ased about where I can review and she said oh it was on the thing on your table where you paid. Really come on.... waitress never asked us if we were thirsty again we only had seen her to order and get our food. And I had to find her to get the bill
