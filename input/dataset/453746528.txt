Wanting to try something new, I stumbled across this place through a Living Deal, completely new to yoga. Started with a beginner class taught by Martha and was hooked day one. The instructors and atmosphere are great--welcoming, caring, and not at all pretentious or intimidating.  It truly is "simply yoga" and that's what is great about it.  I would highly recommend Simply Yoga for anyone wishing to practice yoga, beginner or experienced.
