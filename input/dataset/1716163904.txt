Came here on a date and had the Chef's 5 course tasting menu from Executive Chef Jamilka Borges! Phenomenal! My date is a meat-eater and I am vegetarian and she thought of the most incredible dishes for me. I started with a fried tofu with grilled pineapple, raisin chutney, parsley and topped with a quail egg. The tofu was perfectly cooked and the raisins and pineapple gave it a sweet taste.The next course was frisee, radishes, avacado, edible flowers in a kohlrabi puree. It was a cooler, more refreshing dish that was very light.The third was a manicotti with house-made pasta, a rich cream sauce, with asparagus and pea shoots. A warmer and thicker dish in contrast to the previous dish. The pasta was perfect, soft with a slight tougher chew. A little softer than al dente which was good for manicotti. The fourth, which was my main entree, was a completely unbelievable polenta! Seasoned with just the right amount of salt, it was the perfect consistency. I have never had a better polenta in my life. Had snow peas, a fried egg, asparagus and eggplant.We finished off with a dessert from the pastry chef, had bananas, sorbet and cream puffs and chocolate souffle. Overall, it was fantastic. I can't wait to come back!
