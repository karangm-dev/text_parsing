If I can give -0 stars I would my car has been at the NTB location and Cuyahoga Falls twice in the past month that I have the first thing had something to do with the radiator or the water pump I believe it was in the second I am with my starter being that I felt that I could trust them I took my car back there for the starter that was on October 20, 2017 I then went to go use my car had it for a day and a half and it broke down so something compelled me to go somewhere else thing I did somebody decided and the only place that my hood was NTB what they decide was that they were going to take the wires connected to my spark plugs and switch the spark plugs and also mess with my vacuum hose they lost to say it made my check engine light come on and Blake super fast I barely got it into my driveway and had to have it towed to the new place that was recommended by a friend thank goodness because now my car is running againWhy in heavens name would you do something like that to someone I don't have a lot of money and I need my car to get me back and forth I like to take advantage of people when you do something like that you have no business being in business I would recommend not going there stay as far far far away if you can I don't care if your car is dragging it needs immediate care find somewhere else to go you'll be much better off
