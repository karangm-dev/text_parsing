Mediocre in every way. Watery Hoisin sauce, mostly noodles and very few veggies, the meat wasn't tasty... The whole meal was bland and salty with none of the flavour I associate with Vietnamese food. I don't like leaving bad reviews for small family-run places but honestly the food here is not good. It feels like they have cut a lot of corners to keep prices down and the quality has really suffered.
