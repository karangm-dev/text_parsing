This was my first time and will probably be my last.  I had heard so much about this restaurant and was really looking forward to my first experience with a group of friends. The service was good but the food was just so-so.  Certainly not worth the $135 tab for two (no alcohol).  No one left satisfied and we all agreed that the food was mediocre and definitely not enough to satisfy our bellies and justify the price tag.
