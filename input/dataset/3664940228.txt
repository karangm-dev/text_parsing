We ordered salads, with dressing on the side. What we received seemed more like wilted, almost steamed and left out lettuce, drenched in dressing. Since it was take out, we assumed some sort of mistake had been made, as the staff seemed distracted, but very friendly when we went pick it up. We were told that was what we had ordered and no attempt was made to rectify the situation. We will not return.
