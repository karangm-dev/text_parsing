I've lived in several states over my 52 years, and Speedway is the only place where you have specify which EXACT gas you want!  This is RIDICULOUS!  I visited a Speedway in Westlake, OH for the first time (usually go to Shell or BP), and told the cashier that I needed $40 dollars worth of unleaded.  Went back to my car, and the pump was not working!  I went back inside, and the cashier told me that it should be working.  I go outside again, and the pump is not working!  He then asks me if I was pumping unleaded.  I said, yes, I am trying to put premium unleaded in my car.  He then tells me, "oh, well you said unleaded"!  To which I replied, "Really?!  You have to specify the EXACT kind of unleaded that you want to switch the pump on?!".  He says, "yes".  Now how STUPID is that!  Every single other gas station i've been to, in many states, don't require you to specify which EXACT gas you are putting in, unless it is Diesel!  You just ask for a certain amount of gas, pay the cash, then CHOOSE AT THE PUMP.  But the morons at Speedway have decided to break convention, and ask the customer to exactly specify which exact gas... unbelievably stupid!
