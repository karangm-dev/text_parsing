This place is sometimes a hit and sometimes a miss. When they use to have voodoo hours and appetizers were half off, it was great. I liked the calamari and one time I had the gumbo soup and it was delicious. However I went back and the soup was very salty. Their jambalaya rice is also soggy and not worth the price. A lot of items are overpriced and the prix fix menu choices are items that are unpopular. Staff though are always friendly and responsive. When my friend complained about her jambalaya rice they replaced it. So it's ok if you're in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back.
