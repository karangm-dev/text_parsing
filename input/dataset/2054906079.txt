I would never use this company.We called for a Taxi on new years at around 9 o'clock, they said many were in the area and we should expect one soon. We then called back at 10.30 after no cab had arrived, and they said they would let the driver's know we'd been waiting an hour and a half and that there were taxis in the area. Finally we called back at 11:00 having already missed our show, and we were told that there was no way we could get a cab that night. Why didn't you just tell us from the start we were never going to get a cab? Absolute worst service, from the grumpiest people I've ever experienced. I sincerely hope you go out of business.
