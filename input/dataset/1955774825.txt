Good food but recent price changes are way beyond reasonable.Used to pop in for take-out of $10 entrees.   Called to get take out today and was told prices on the website were wrong but prices just raised slightly.  When we arrived to pick up was surprised at the bill:-   Ginger chicken was $10 , now $14...... a 40% increase-   Cashew chicken was $10, now $15..... a 50% increase-    Mango salad was $6, now $8 .... a 33% increase.I understand raising prices as costs go up but really?    This is beyond reasonable so won't be going back.
