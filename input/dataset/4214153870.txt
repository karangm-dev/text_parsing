We called about the wait, and they could seat us ASAP. Naturally we rushed over. It only took us 10 minutes. Upon our arrival, we were told it would be another hour and a half before we would be seated. That wasn't going to fly, so after complaining, they sat us in the corner of the bar. It took 20 minutes to get water which was disappointing. It's fish fry night so naturally we got the cod. It was SOOOOO battered. I could go on, but I think you get the point...I will say that the interior was very nice!
