My wife and I come here often, but after today's experience, we might have to find another place for vietnamese food. The food is good and the prices are decent. However, the service here is a hit or miss, and lately it has been absolutely horrible. Our orders often come out incorrect or items are missed despite pointing to the item on the menu when ordering. At first, we thought it was because they are busy, but there weren't that many dinners tonight and this seems to be the norm based on our past few experiences here.
