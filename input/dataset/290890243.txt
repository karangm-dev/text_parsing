Was amazing the first visit (when corporate was still overseeing their operations during the first few weeks of opening). The second visit was horrible.  We won't be returning. The salads were watery and tasteless, the fries were old burnt and overseasoned, the restaurant was dirty and the tables sticky, and the staff was impatient and unprofessional.
