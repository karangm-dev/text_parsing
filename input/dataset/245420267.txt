We contacted Republic West to give us an estimate on a front entry door and they agreed to a set appointment on a Saturday @ 10:00 am.  After an hour and a half  later,  my husband finally got a hold of them and they apologized and told him the salesman got caught up with another appt in Phoenix.  They never contacted us to let us know they were running late or would need to re-schedule the appt.  If my husband hadn't called them who knows if they would have called.  He re- scheduled for another day later in the week for the afternoon.  This appt the sales person never showed or called.  Obviously this company is far too busy and doesn't appear to need the work. Very poor customer service and does not follow up or seem to care.
