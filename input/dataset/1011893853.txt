MMAC is an asset to the Ahwatukee community, providing traditional martial arts training where discipline is learned and advancement is earned. This is a traditional Japanese dojo, where everyone doesn't get a medal and you don't buy your child's blackbelt in 2 years; enablement, entitlement, and excuses are not tolerated. My son has been training with the Sensei's of MMAC since 2006, starting in their program held at the Ahwatukee YMCA at the age of 7. Anyone who has met my son will attest to his maturity, balance, and discipline, and I attribute much of that learned behavior to his dedicated training at MMAC.
