Really disappointed in this place after reading so many previous Yelp reviews that were so positive.  Bottom line was the pizza and cheese sticks we had were less than mediocre. I have high pizza expectations as it is my favorite food and has been for forty years and Molly's just doesn't stand up. No crispness to the crust...very floppy. Sausage is grated? No where near enough cheese especially on the cheese bread...ahem...cheese bread...hellllloooo? It should be covered in cheese.  See my pics.  One positive...inexpensive and fast...but you get what you pay for.
