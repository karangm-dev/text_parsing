Finally found the best Mexican Food and restaurant since living in Nevada. This place did not disappointed us! There is usually a wait to get in which alone should tell you it's pretty great. Highly recommend the queso dip! Fajitas are yummy, you definitely get your money's worth here as the drink prices are very reasonable as well. The only thing that sucked was the waiting area is way too small and you have to be inside to hear them call your name but it's pretty cramped with people and is uncomfortable. The Host, Waiter and Bussers were so awesome. Overall will be back again and again and again!!
