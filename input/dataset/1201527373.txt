Stop me before I buy anything here again! Last summer I bought patio furniture here and this year decided to buy the chaise pool chairs to go with it.  I went in on March 19th and was told they would arrive in about 5-6 weeks.  OK. On May 10 I get a call from the salesperson who told me that they would not arrive until the end of May. Here it is May 29th so I call for an update.  The sales person says he called me right after that phone call to say they were in on May 10 - I did not receive a call.  He asks me to call customer service to schedule a delivery.  Wouldn't you think if there is sold product to be delivered they would be all over that to get it delivered and out the door?  Um...this is how you generate money and satisfy the customer.  So I call customer service and the first they can deliver is in about a week.  Wow.  I posted a couple years ago about my leather sectional and chair fiasco and now this.  I wonder how long it will take for RCW to actually get a clue. I am stunned.
