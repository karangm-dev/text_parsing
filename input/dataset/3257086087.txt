My fave place to get Poke on the mainland! Every time we come to Henderson, this is a must-stop for us.  Although we have a lot of new Poke places in California, they all suck! They don't know Poke.  I hate that those places don't marinade their Poke because they do it made-to-order.  It's all gimmick and no flavor.  I wish they would open a location in California! My favorite one is the Spicy Ahi which comes with spicy mayo and masago! Yum!!
