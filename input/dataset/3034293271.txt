On the one hand, i love gp and on the other, it's gotten obscenely expensive.  there are affordable shoes, but they are mostly canvas runners and the treton wellies. i only buy things there if they're on sale now. occasionally there's a find (notably chie miharas and marc jacobs under $100). but if they're going higher end, i'd like to see a bit more effort with the hig-end stuff. why are there no viv westwoods? and when did they shift from the quirky campers to the boring ones my mom picks up and tells me are "nice"?
