Two thumbs up!!!!Pho (soup) and their Banh Minhs (sandwiches) are to die for!!! Not to mention their Chinese Food choices!!!! This place is a hole in the wall but their food choices are awesome!!!Located 5 miles from the airport, no traffic, parking is not a problem either!!!!The staff are courteous and gets your order right!!!
