I love subway, but this one is pitiful. The new owner sucks, and so do the employees. Their sign says they open at 7:00am, I came at 7:52am and they weren't open. I waited and they decided to open the doors around 8am. They still weren't ready... I had to wait additional time for them to prep everything... The one bigger girl that works there always has an attitude and is insulted that you come to subway to get her to make your freakin sandwich.
