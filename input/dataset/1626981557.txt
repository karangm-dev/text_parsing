Was an awesome place to eat, first time coming here as we are from out of town (Idaho). We ordered the Chicken Parmesan, Double Philly Steak with everything, meatball sub, fries and a meat lasagna. It was all excellent food, each one of us liked what we ordered. Owner is super friendly and nice to talk too. One of the best Italian restaurants to eat at in Las Vegas! Will be back next time I am in town. Thanks for the awesome food
