We had a lunch at this place on Saturday and had bad experience.The ONE star is for friendly staff and owner.The restaurant claims to be a south Indian restaurant but unfortunately you do not get those  flavors and taste.I am sure most south Indians will not appreciate their taste.The floor is very bad and dirty too.Overall, will not step in next time.
