Well, time to find a new grocery. Maybe Bashas. Ever since Albertsons bought them, service has gone down hill. Not enough check out cashiers and they then get rid of the self check out lanes. What are they thinking. Every other retailer is going this route, Home Depot, Lowes, Wal Mart and even some restaurants have Kiosks on each table. I hope they rethink this marketing strategy. We have plenty of choices in the Valley. Frys and Bashas are just as close.
