Party of five and we all sat up at the oyster bar for happy hour.  It was my first time to try oysters and these were pretty good.  However, the Hispanic guy (wearing the cabbie hat) who was working the oyster bar didn't make the experience good or even great.  Drinks came out slow, he forgot condiments (and other info about oysters), and just a plain old super rigid guy.  We even asked if we could try other stuff at the bar, he gave a quick "NO" and continued on with his happy hour.  I never saw him crack a smile or joke around except with other coworkers.  It was just a bad experience.  I have been told that there is another person that works the oyster bar who is a hundred times better so next time, I will make sure its not frowny face mcgee working the oyster bar.
