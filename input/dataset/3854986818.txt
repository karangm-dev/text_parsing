Food is very good but service is very bad. We went there Monday night at 8:30pm an was told that we could only order A togo order. IThe open sign was on and the sign in the window said they were open till 9pm. I was told that the kitchen was cleaned for the day and we could only take our food to go. Sad that a restaurant values there customers so little that they turn them away.   Shame on them!
