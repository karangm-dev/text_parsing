We celebrated my grandsons' graduation from ASU this week.  This place has great food and drink and it also has character and history.  My grandson was impressed that they had a congratulatory card on the reserved table signed by the entire staff.  We did not want to leave and in fact, we were the last ones to leave Lon's.    We explored the inn after dinner and all agreed that this was a night to remember.   Even though we live in the Chicagoland area, we will definitely return to this enchanting place.  We will also spread the word.
