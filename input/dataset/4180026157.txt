I love this place!!! Whenever I don't have something new in mind to try, this is my go to spot in Vegas.When I first tried it out last year...I went in with the thought "Its time to see if Guy Fieri's food is as good as his eating" haha. I know Guy is very knowledgeable in cuisine from his studies and experience but I've never actually seen him cook on TV nor display his creations so coming here was a must and I was not let down.Go big or go home is displayed in the restaurant and it holds true to it. Not only are the portions big, there absolutely delicious!!! Two items are a no brainer...the Mac n Cheese Bacon burger and the Fireball whiskey wings. I can't even stress how delicious these two items are. So much flavor!!! I've returned time and time again trying new items but I find myself still ordering that Mac n Cheese burger along with whatever else I've ordered after trying it the first time. Cant get enough of that burger.The environment is awesome and the drinks are excellent! The desserts are just as huge as the actual meals also. So far I've tried the Cheesecake Challenge and The Boulder Fried Ice Cream. Damn good stuff...unfortunately, I have to throw up the white flag 25% into the desserts because I'm usually stuffed by then. Thank God I have friends for back up to finish LOL.Guy Fieri's Kitchen & Bar is an awesome place and gives you your money's worth for lunch, dinner and desserts. I haven't tried breakfast yet but I'll get around to it.Dinner 7/13/2014, Dessert 7/14/2014, Lunch 12/6/2014, and Lunch 2/12/2015
