Con artists. Went there for happy hour and advertised 1/2 off appetizers and 1/2 off beers and drinks. Awesome. Had a good time.Went there next week. Waited until we got out check and waitress said "Oh, only certain appetizers are half off and you guys got the other ones. Very disappointed because that's wasn't what was advertised.Went back a third time for a buddy's birthday/happy hour. This time ordered the correct appretizers but NOW SHE SAYS AFTER SHE BROUGHT THE OUTRAGEOUS CHECK..."Oh, only drafts are half off." I was so angry it wasn't even funny. Will not go back to this place with this kind of false advertising!!!
