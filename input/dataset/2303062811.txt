I stopped into Luna's on York Road in Parma Heights for a quick lunch. This is a local restaurant that I used to enjoy going to but today I found the overall experience to be disappointing. The staff wasn't especially friendly or quick at seating us. The table was dirty, with syrup all over it. The server seemed to be in a rush and appeared disinterested in us. While the food was served quickly, it was lacking flavor. I had a grilled chicken sandwich and the bun was soggy. The fries were tasteless. I don't anticipate visiting the York Road Luna's again any time soon.
