Great food! Horrible Service I know this place is new so I expected to wait. I waited about 40 minutes inside. No staff ever came out to say anything about the wait. I had to ask a passing by waitress for a paper menu so I didnt loose my place in line. When I got towards the front of line, I realized they had 3 registers but only one was being used. There was a swarm of employees around the food area though. There was tons of chicken ready to go, but the employees were super slow in packaging it, repeatedly checking receipts. When I was finally able to order, I had a hard time communicating with the cashier due to language barrier. After placing the order I waited another 15 mins for it to be packaged. The employee I guess that checks the food argued with me about the sauces. I told her my receipt says I should get 4 sauces, and she kept insisting that I pay extra. I had to get the attention of the cashier that took my order to let her know, Then she had to tell the girl in spanish. I tried to check my order but she kinda blocked me and said I had everything. She placed my large order in a paper bag, and I asked for a handle bag and she got an attitude. When I got home I was missing items! I have been in contact with corporate. I really hope they improve their customer service skills as the food was good.I ordered the chicken both fried and grilled. Both were extremely juicy and well seasoned.The guava BBQ sauce was very good.The mango and jaimaica drinks were light and not too sweet.I ordered the empanadas trio which was great the crust was crispy & flaky. The cilantro chicken was the best.Hopefully, it will be better when theres not as much hype from it being new, and they get employees with better customer service skills that actually know the menu.
