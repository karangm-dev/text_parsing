Horrible. Avoid at all costs. Even the contractors they hire call them shady.  They refuse to do repairs or take weeks to get issues "fixed".  Their customer service is atrocious. We'd ask for repairs to be made and would get "its functional".  My son kept cutting his knee on an exposed tack strip and I had to complain for months to get a threshold installed and then it was installed incorrectly and it took THREE visits to get it right.  We came home to water pouring down our driveway due to burst pipes that weren't insulated properly.  Because of Talley's shoddy contractors our pipes repeatedly froze even after the flood!!  All they care about is collecting money.  They don't care about the tenants they service.  They do repairs in a cheap fashion which causes issues to be "fixed" numerous times.  Save the headache.  Find a company that will care about you.
