Had their chicken thigh and leg combo today for $10.25. Where do I begin? First off, the chicken looked like it was in mutant form...definitely not ontario grade quality. The batter was very bland and had no flavour whatsoever. Judging from the positive yelp reviews, I thought I was in for a treat - not a science experiment taste test. One yelper said the chicken was on par with popeyes or kfc....dude - you are definitely as kookoo as the chicken and the same goes for the rest of you. May the flavour gods be with your taste buds.This was pure highway robbery - definitely will not be returning.
