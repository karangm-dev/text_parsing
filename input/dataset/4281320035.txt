I made reservations which I had to change because of my poor planning.  They were gracious and allowed me to change date.  We were seated in the bar area and I wasn't leaning towards happy. All the servers were exceptional, attentive and suppoted each other when asked for items....in addition the main uniform of neat jeans, white shirt & nice shoes....was a pleasant change.Thank you to all that I interacted with. ...you all contribute to a GREAT restaurant experience!!
