I switched to Dr. Rehl after having a poor experience with my precious ENT and I am so happy that I did. Not only is Dr. Rehl knowledgeable and kind, he takes his time and explains the situation and options thoroughly so you never feel rushed. Also, I have always been seen at my scheduled appointment time and have never waited around like I often do with other specialists. Follow up is always prompt from both the staff and doctor (the Dr. even called me with test results at 5:30pm on a Friday). Everyone is friendly and the office itself is clean and comfortable!
