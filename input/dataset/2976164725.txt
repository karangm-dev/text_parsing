The staff treats you like you're a criminal. They search in every single pocket you have, all of your backpack, your wallet, they look at your money, they ask you to take your shoes AND SOCKS off. I'm never coming back. They also took my freaking cereal bar, a CEREAL BAR at 2pm at a pool party. Seriously, not worth it.
