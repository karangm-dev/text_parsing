I agree with everyone else who has complained about the staff (and the gross, stained coffee mugs). Our server was very rude. He made snarky little comments about everything I did. I'd never had this happen to me anywhere else. I don't know how anyone can speak with such attitude and be so critical towards a customer that they don't even know. It was very strange and off-putting, I don't think I'll be returning.My portion of food was decent, I wasn't able to finish it all (got a rude remark from the server about that), but my friends portion seemed very small. It tasted alright, nothing too special. It certainly didn't make up for the bad server. There are plenty of other placed to eat where the staff won't make you feel like crap.
