I still don't understand why people like this so much.... it must be the novelty of having a place where the waiters come out to your car.I tried their prize winning burger, and, honestly, I found it very bland (not to be harsh but I like burgerking more).  The dog was small for the price, but I did like their milkshakes alot as thick as they were.
