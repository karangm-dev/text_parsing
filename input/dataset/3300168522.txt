Went here looking for gluten free fried chicken and found my new favorite place to eat! I hate going to the strip but for chicken like my granny used to make....I make an exception! It has best country-chic atmosphere and the manager is legit one of the nicest dudes you'll meet! Bar menu rocks too! Will he back again as!soon as we can. You rock Yardbird!
