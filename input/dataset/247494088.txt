During my two and a half Vegas trip with my boyfriend, this was one of the places we passed by and tried it out Tuesday night.We asked the hostess what her favorites were currently which was the chicken wings and chicken milanese. So we ordered that and a pepperoni pizza.The wings were $16 which was a little expensive, but they tasted amazing. They were lightly sweet with a Latin fish sauce and had chilies (which brought the entire dish together). 5/5However, that was the only thing about the meal that was good.The pizza came and when we tried taking a bite of it, the toppings (cheese and all) just slid off. Granted it was hot, but i do not prefer eating pizza with a fork and knife. 3/5The chicken milanese was overcooked and dry. I have had chicken milanese before and it was flavorful. At WPB, it was lacking in seasoning, flavor and tenderness. The salad on top was overdressed and overly salty. I did try it together and it did not do it for me. I have a feeling instead of it being pan fried, it was deep fried by the dryness of it. 1/5We didn't order cocktails, as there are places with more reasonable prices. I mean $17 for a muscow mule, which is: vodka, ginger beer and a little lime. We just went to whiskey down and had amazing whisky at that price.I would say, get the wings and maybe some fries and then get out, not worth the price for the quality of the food.
