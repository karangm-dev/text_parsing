Went for my birthday, service was mediocre.  Figured we'd get southern food (shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles.) grits were horrible, im pretty sure they were instant grits, and probably soaked in plain water.  The chicken and waffles were nothing spectacular, chicken was kind of soggy. They need to work on the breading better.  I really wanted to like this place, the menu looks good, but i feel no reason to ever go back.
