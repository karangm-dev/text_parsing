My favorite restaurant search filter these days is "dog friendly". Our toy Chihuahua would much rather go with us than be left behind in a strange motel room smelling of Fabreze. The dog-friendly filter for Las Vegas yielded a few places that looked like they might work for both humans and dogs.Lazy Dog Restaurant & Bar fit the bill. We went here for brunch after church and were promptly ushered to a comfortable, covered outdoor patio. What first struck me was the dog-friendly section was packed while the indoor tables were sparely populated. This place is a magnet for dog owners. Everybody seemed to get along. The owners wisely figured out that packing dogs too closely together could lead to territorial disputes.We ordered a delicious hummus appetizer and the sunny side up pizza. Our dog slept through the hummus plate but woke up when the pizza arrived sprinkled with bits of bacon. I got through two slices before she wormed out of the shoulder bag carrier and had her paws on the table. I gave her a dish with some egg yolk, bacon sprinkles, and a bit of pizza crust. She was happy, I was happy and relaxed. I had ordered the beer sampler (they make their own) which I highly recommend.There was only one barking incident when two dogs left at the same time when two new ones entered. Our waiter said his favorite dog day was when he had a packed house and an ambulance went by.
