Your account gets put on auto renew. Then you get charged the first payment of next year before you are allowed to cancel with a zero balance. Then you can't get a refund for the payment even though you haven't used the services. Literally they took 40 bucks for NOTHING.The people on the phone were really rude about it too. Probably because they hear it all day. Sadly the service was pretty good, but I can't abide taking your money and giving nothing in return.
