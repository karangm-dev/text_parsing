Small hidden building I would've never thought of walking in. But I searched for something near and this cane up, don't regret it at all. The service was great, he was kind and attentive assuring we didn't have any questions. Was willing to swap anything we didn't like(but we wouldn't do that, that's just rude) so we all tried something different and shared. It was all great. A must go back when your feeling like having some Columbian food
