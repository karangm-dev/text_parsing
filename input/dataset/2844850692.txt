I've been to Joe's MR 3 times and each time I'm more impressed with their menu. Tonight, I had the fish tacos--they are by far the best fish tacos I have ever had. And the corn on the cob side was amazing (I'm not a corn on the cob fan). Just had to give this place 5 stars because food is exceptional, especially for the price. The background music makes your experience even better.  I could help but dance in my seat. I hope Joe's is around for a while.
