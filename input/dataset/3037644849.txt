I was so excited to come here after having this place bookmarked for a month or so and driving by on a weekly. My boyfriend and I finally came in on a Sunday morning and it was packed! I was so sad because I was starving and anxious for some delicious food. The wait was only about 15-20 minutes and we got to stare at all of the delicious-looking pastries in the mean time.After being seated, we browsed through the menu (which looks like a newspaper) and it was pretty hard for us to make up our mind. My boyfriend decided to get the chicken-fried steak with eggs, potatoes, and a super egg onion bagel while I got the mushroom and cheese omelet with potatoes and a jalapeño cheese bagel. His chicken-fried steak was delicious, he said, and the bagel was SO good. I definitely should have ordered that bagel instead because I felt that the jalapeño-cheddar bagel was lacking in flavor. It was still good, especially with their amazing cream cheese on the side, just not super flavorful.My mushroom and cheese omelet was pretty good, cheesy and mushroomy like you'd expect. The fresh-squeezed orange juice was literally the best orange juice I've ever had in my life. No exaggeration there. It was delicious. The service was quick and super friendly! After we ate, even though I was so full that I was bursting at the seams, we went to go get pastries. We splurged. We got raspberry, coconut lemon, blueberry, and apple cinnamon rugalach as well as a "mini" eclaire, chocolate dipped macaroon, chocolate dipped Florentine, and raspberry linzer tart. We devoured all of those within 2 days of going there. No regrets... Besides not buying the coconut cream cake and almond horseshoe but we're saving those for next time! :D coming back soon!!
