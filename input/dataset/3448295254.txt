My boyfriend and I have come here several times since moving to the neighborhood. Always great beers, friendly people sitting around to chat with. Super inviting atmosphere and laid back vibes. The drink specials are decent and they even serve this amazing Meade I recommend if you've never tried the stuff. We don't even smoke much anymore but we will still be back!
