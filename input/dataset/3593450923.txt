I was visiting mom again this time with my brother who enjoys a good steak, my mom of course had to take 'the boys' out for that steak. The suggestions were Tony Romas or Le Bistro for me it was Bistro all the way until my brother suggested "Outback" ????? I convinced him a Bistro New York strip would best anything Outback could ever dream of serving.So Bistro it was and five star satisfaction it was again
