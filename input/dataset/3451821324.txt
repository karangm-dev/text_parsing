I dig the Happy Dog and it's downstairs brother, Under Dog.  Happy Dog is a nice dive with tasty dogs that aren't expensive.  The beers are good and the bartenders are cool/friendly.  Sometimes they have live music, which is also fun.  Oh, and the $5 hot dogs with unlimited toppings is a huge plus.  I'm not talking about the junk hot dogs you get at dollar dog night Indian's games.  Hell, I'm not talking about the hot dogs you get at any Indians game.  These are big and plump fatties made with all beef--the kind that have some texture and actually taste good.  And the toppings menu is long and varied with awesome ingredients. One $5 dog with a slew of amazing toppings is more than enough for dinner... I promise.While it looks a  bit like a hipster-focused dive at times, don't let that deter you.  It's not some exclusive place meant to cater to only the most stereotypical of hipsters.  Everyone is welcome and that's part of the fun.  I've seen families in the afternoons, groups of women in their 60's in the evenings, average Joes and Janes, metal heads, punk rockers, front runners, real hipsters and their less hardcore snappy-dresser-only counterparts, and all sorts of people from all sorts of walks of life.  The Under Dog in the downstairs is also great--it's got a small bar, some old arcade games, and a sweet shuffle board table.  It reminds me of the drinking man's bars my dad would take me to as a child while he engaged int he regular maintenance of his alcoholism.  No, it's not a bad memory.  I know these sorts of places as being friendly and welcoming.  The kind of joint where you focus on your drink and the casual conversation of a few strangers you just met.  It's a fun thing.
