I haven't been to this location but have been to the one in bridgeland. The one there is awesome ! On with the review....Today I went for an ice cream, and when sitting in my across the street from redbloom salon, I watched a bored receptionist do something very unhygienic. The salon seemed empty, so she went up to the makeup bar that's in front of the window and started doing her make up. The problem is, she was using the products RIGHT ON her face (eyeliner, mascara, brushes for face cosmetics), then replacing them with out cleaning what she used. Ummm, yuck ! It's very unprofessional and super unhygienic for customers. This redbloom is the closest to my home, and it has deterred from going there in the future.
