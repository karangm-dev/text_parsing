Oh wow, I read some reviews and I honestly don't agree with them at all!!First and foremost it's terribly expensive! Every thing is Ã€ la cart. I ordered a New York strip 52.00 and it was like chewing a piece of rubber @ med well and to top that off it was so salty it was at that point i couldn't-even stand to put another SALTY bite into my mouth. I asked them to remove from the table and requested a full refund for that piece rubber!! By far the WORST STEAK I'VE  EVER EXPERIENCED.!This place was expensive people were literally sitting down and quickly leaving as soon as the sat down! Go to Ruth Chris at Harrahs!!CV, ATLANTA
