I tried to shop here today to buy multiple shoes for work. This Hispanic girl (using her phone while on duty then sticking it behind her ass as she approached me) asked if I needed help. I asked her if there were any specials and told me they were having a sale. I told her I have several emails with coupons and she said just as long they have a barcode, I can use. I also mentioned I had a  25% coupon my coworker had gave me. She immediately told me I cannot use a "print-screen" coupon as if I was a con artist. Then she walked away and did not bother helping me. My coworker told me her Payless location let her use the coupon regardless if it was a print screen. So I was furious and decided not to purchase anymore. Instead I just tried on shoes and took pictures of the model numbers when I knew I liked them. I left the store, went home, and shopped online using the 25% coupon she said I couldn't use and free shipping. Too bad their store would've made over $100 extra revenue off of me but they chose to treat loyal customers with bad customer service. From now on, I'm just going to purchase my shoes online. Thanks lazy girl with an attitude!
