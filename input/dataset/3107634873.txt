This place used to be great when I lived in the area.  I recently started a new job which put me back in close proximity to the restaurant and it's really gone downhill.  It starts with simple stuff, like pick up orders not even been started when I arrive 30 minutes after ordering.  Chips are always burnt.  Salads are lettuce fields barren of meat.  Once in a while you get lucky and get the old food quality that I was used to, but it seems like the glory days of old are gone.
