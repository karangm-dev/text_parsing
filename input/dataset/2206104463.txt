I recently moved from Vegas to Texas. I've always went to floss when I lived there and had a great experience. I'll admit it: I'm still the adult scared of the dentist. Luckily I found floss and everyone there is really amazing. When I was in town they managed to squeeze me in their schedule at the last minute. One of the best things about this place is their not out to make money their genuinely there to help. They'll explain everything and why it is or isn't necessary. It's also a great place for kids both my nephews go there. Dr. Tounian is awesome knew I could trust him when I saw his snazzy shoes ;]
