This was my first time at this restaurant and I was very impressed. This location is inside Mandalay Bay, near the convention center. I came here for brunch with a few friends and they have an unlimited small plates menu for only $35. You can add unlimited mimosas too for $10. Of course, I did the unlimited small plates and mimosas.I pretty much tried every item on the menu and everything was really good. My favorties were the waffles, breakfast fries, and pigs in a blanket. You might has well order everything off of the menu because it's unlimited! The food comes out as it's made. The mimosas were really food. They were definitely heavy handed with the champagne. They have a ton of different flavors and seasonal flavors. They have blood orange (my favorite), passion fruit, prickly pear, mango, pomegranate and more! Some of them lacked flavor and just tasted like champagne, but hey, it's unlimited so who cares! I stayed here for about 3 hours with my friends just eating and drinking. This is now probably one of my favorite brunch spots!
