Been there twice!  Both times the food was good.  Nothing to write home about but decently good.  The reason for the 2 stars...the service!  Wow!  Talk about horrible service.  The first time we went we sat for about 20 mins without our server even approaching our table.  We finally had to flag him down and ask him if we can put our order in.  The rest of the visit was more of the same.  Us sitting and constantly flagging the server down for things we needed cause he never stop by on his own.  2nd visit was more of the same...had to ask multiple times for anything we wanted.  Had to flag server down cause he never stop by our table.  My cousin had time to walk to CVS and back before the server came to our table and take our order.  I don't think I will go back.  Service just really sucked.  No one was rude or anything but being constantly ignored was not an enjoyable dining experience.
