Ever since I've tried their Pizza - I cannot go back to any other.Plenty of toppings choices, everyone can find something to their liking.Prices are okay, they have deals - so that's something worth considering, especially if it's a lot of people, since they have also sizes such "Jumbo" and "Party Size", which the last one I didn't try, but the "Jumbo"... Oh my.It was so huge, my husband and I took three days to finish it.Every bite is good.The place itself is quite small, but I believe that the good thing about it, is that everything is authentic and their true to their agenda without being too commercial at all, and I like it.It's like a boutique place for pizzas.Go Lemar's!
