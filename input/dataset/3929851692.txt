I don't care how many phony reviews on this place they post.  This place is the worst dining experience I have had since I moved to Vegas 3 years ago. They charge 29.99 for an experience that is not even worth $9.99.  In over an hour of dining never saw a skewer of filet, lamb, or flank steak.  I guess they had to get rid of everything they did not sell for lunch.   Should have known better when they were empty on Saturday night.
