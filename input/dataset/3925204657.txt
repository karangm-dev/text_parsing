Check in desk was chaos.  Reserved the car in boyfriends name and they wouldn't let me pay with my credit card so we had to change the name on the reservation.  The check in person said we could drop it off at circus circus which was right by our hotel.  I called the day before we were to turn in the car and they told me it would be more money to drop it off there.  Also if I wanted to extend the rental by 7 hours, it would be $350.  Worst customer service ever.  I will not use them ever.
