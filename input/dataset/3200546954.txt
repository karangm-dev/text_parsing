Bought a Groupon to get my car alligned. It was frustrating to get an appointment; called multiple times before getting an appointment. I showed up at the appointment to be told they couldn't do it at that time so we ended up waiting for over an hour. By the time the car was done, half of my day off was wasted.If you value your time, don't bother coming here.
