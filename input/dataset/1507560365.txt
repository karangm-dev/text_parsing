Service was very slow. Took at least 20 minutes to get my food when there was only one car in front of me. The girl at the drive through wasn't very friendly. The food was ok. Well at least the burger was good. My friend got two beef tacos and she said they were gross. Jack in the box has better tacos for a better price. They weren't with the $1.50. Probably won't be back to this location.
