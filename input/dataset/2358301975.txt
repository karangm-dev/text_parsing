I had a fun when I went here as any 22 year old would but it is expensive, I got a double vodka soda and it was $19.More importantly I left my card there and have called everyday the last 5 days and it goes straight to a recorded message and they have yet to get back to me. I know my debit card is there so it's very frustrating to not get a call back.
