Since coming to Margaret with my wedding dress alterations, I have since returned to her for alterations and repairs on other items in my wardrobe - namely cocktail dresses that needed to be taken in. She quickly and expertly tailored my dresses for a perfect fit - and at truly reasonable rates! Having Margaret as a resource to take my off-the-rack garments from an adequate fit to a custom-tailored fit feels like the height of luxury. I look forward to coming back to her with future consignment store finds and beloved-if-ill-fitting frocks!
