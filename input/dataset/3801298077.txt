Came here on a Sunday evening.  It's not busy at all.  Staff did not greet upon entering.  They were chit chatting. Finally one decided to come up and sit us down. We weren't served water until we asked for it (that's after we were half way done with our dessert.) the ice cream they served was like shaved ice texture. It was frozen and flaky. How could you serve that and call it ice cream? If I wanted shaved ice I have better places to go to.  Usually this place brings smiles to the patrons but today I felt they let us down big time. Up your game,  staff at this location.
