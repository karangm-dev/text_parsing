I loved this show so much I wanted to watch it again right after it finished. It's not the typical Cirque show, but a perfect tribute to the Beatles...Cirque does the fab four proud! If your looking for the typical Cirque show I would not recommend this one (try O), but I love the Beatles so maybe I'm biased. I did not love the giftshop and their $40 t-shirts tho...
