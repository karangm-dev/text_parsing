NOT accommodating for parties larger than 4.  We have now tried on 3 separate occasions to come here with a party of 5, 6, and 8.  First time we had to point out a table of 5 to the hostess.  Second time, the hostess stared at us when we said 6, and said shed have to ask her manager what the wait time would be, and then never returned.  Most recent time, I tried to make a reservation for 8 people on a Friday night, apparently they only have one table on the patio for 8 people and its reserved.  Guess they can't move tables/put two tables together.  Odd they are so eager to turn away big parties.  Only reason for 2 stars is because of the cute decor/patio and brussels sprout nachos.
