I had a horrible experience here, called asked if they were busy said they weren't.  I showed up let them know I wanted a full set and a reg pedicure.  I was set in a chair given a very short "reg pedicure" led to a table where my full set was done. I pointed out that my nails were too wide, too thick and several are crooked. She said it will be alright. It's Not! Then she asked if I wanted my cuticles trimmed, it took 4 more min no problem. Then I asked for my total, she said she needed my card, I said how much? She came back after running my card and I had to ask her again for the breakdown. It was $78 For full set w/gel and a regular pedicure. That was after happy hour discount of $8.  It was $5 extra for calus removal and $10 extra for the express mani extra 4 min to clean up cuticles. Never going back! Ridiculous
