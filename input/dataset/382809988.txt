I had a great experience with Coach Erin! I have been going through a lot of changes in my life personally and professionally and had been feeling pretty lost. I have a ton of thoughts and ideas but was having a hard time sorting through them and making a decision about which direction to go in. It was so refreshing and enlightening to have Coach Erin listen to all my "stuff" and from her birds eye view she was able to help me sort through all the ideas and see a common thread, which simplified my crazy making and gave me a clearer idea of how to integrate my experiences with my strengths and passions. With that clearer vision, together we discovered some new possibilities with a new angle and came up with some strategies to move in that direction.
