It's hard to imagine a worse hotel than Super 8 Beachwood, east of Cleveland.  The overall cleanliness was questionable, and the carpets had many stains.  The hotel's breakfast was quite inadequate, and the fruit did not appear to be fresh.  Worst of all, however, the hotel management team was very unprofessional.  Not only were the hotel staffers unfriendly, they were downright rude to guests.  This hotel was rated at the level of "one star," but could more accurately be rated at the level of "no star."
