If you want to have the best massage/spa experience in town, then this is the place to be! Of the few times I have visited, I was lucky to have the Travelzoo deal in hand. But I will be returning as soon as I can without one because they just don't produce them often enough for me to go as much as I would like to!You really can't beat a super relaxing massage in such a beautiful environment...When you walk up the spiral stairs to the spa, you are taken through a small ritual that really does help set you in the mood to be pampered and feel well.The relaxation lounges are a must. Especially after a massage. And then after some time in the Steam Room, or in the whirlpool. Just anytime, its an experience all on its own! And within the social lounges you are able to mingle with the girls or guys (depending on your gender obviously) and sip on extra delicious teas and nibble on fruits as well. From there you have access to your locker and all the heat rooms and whirlpool area, restrooms and showers. All perfect stocked with the items you would need.The patio pool is where it is at though! Its the perfect spot to catch some energizing rays and take a dip in the pool. Although the menu is a bit on the pricey side, the bites they offer are quite delicious and go well with a glass of champagne and deliciously crisp cucumber and lemon water. And my oh my, what a view. Who would have thought a lump of rock could be so soothing and beautiful. Through Joya Spa, I can find the small appreciation of the fact that I live in a dust bowl of a desert.
