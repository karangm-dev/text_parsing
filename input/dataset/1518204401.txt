It is with great pleasure that I Yelp Tiffany at Mr D's Barber Shop.  I used to get my hair cut by random, overweight effeminate men and always left with a different haircut and an uncomfortable look on my face every time.  Not that there's anything wrong with random, overweight effeminate men but they just can't hold a candle to Tiffany's hair-cutting prowess.  Not only has she blessed me with the greatest haircut of my life, she has the uncanny ability to replicate it every time she cuts my hair.  You would assume this to be a quality all hair stylists possess, but then you would be surprised.  To top it off, she is so laid back that you can send her text messages to set up an appointment.  If you'd like, you can sit in awe and listen to the highly intelligent parrots talk about the stock market (this place is so awesome they have talking parrots, miniature golf and "Tiger Woods") or you could just have a conversation with Tiffany while she cuts your hair: she's just a genuinely cool person. Highly recommended.
