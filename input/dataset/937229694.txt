I absolutely loved that this place has a whole vegan menu. My favorite place to go in the morning had recently moved, and I was really craving a good breakfast. I had some really great "Chik'n & Waffles" which was amazing! My brother also got the french toast which was stunning. The two syrup choices are a nice touch as well. I would highly recommend checking this place out for their vegan selection. They have a whole menu and not just one choice! I will definitely be visiting them again in the future.
