We came here on a Saturday night. We got served quickly, but then it got busy fast and i think they only had 2 people serving tables. We asked for water and never got it. So needless to say they ignored us. We had to leave our table and chase down the bartender to pay. The place is very loud too. The beer was ok. The Margarita was bad. The pretzels were eh. Definitely go somewhere else.
