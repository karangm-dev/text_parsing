Let's see... where to start.  First off. No Water! Every restaurant I have been in offers water as a basic.  Water was not offered.  No beverage suggestions from waiter.The menu was in Chinese only. And lucky me, my wife can ready it. I can't read a lick of it.  The staff were more concerned with wiping the place clean then serving.  Really how many times can you wipe a table?  And then they all kinda cluster in the back part of the restaurant from time to time.  Can't seem to get anyone to take our order.Moving along...Very hard to get the cheque as well.  I could walk out and come back and they wouldn't notice.  My wife noticed that the other patrons (only 3 other tables) have what appears to be water jugs at their table.  Still waiting to flag someone for the cheque...  Got someone.  Aaargh she doesn't understand English?!Okay as for the food.  The soup filled dumplings are extremely salty.  Hate to see what the sodium count is.  The other item we ordered was bland at best.I'm going to try the other place that other members have cited at a later date for comparison.
