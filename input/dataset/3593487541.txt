I was actually introduced to this place on my trip up there last year, and convinced my cousins to go there this year (and we ended up going twice)..  This is almost as an American style breakfast diner as you can get, but with excellent Canadian food.  The crepes are amazing.  I don't think there was a single complaint from anyone about the food.  And they have creton..  I've had canned creton, and fresh made, and this is fresh made, nice, creamy, just the right flavor.  This is the place everyone on our bus stops at for breakfast, and I'm sure we'll be stopping again and again.  Also, depending on what you get, the price can vary from one $ to 2 $$ in the "price range" section, but well worth whatever it is.
