Normally Best Western locations score high in my book. They're unassuming, not trying to be lavish nor trying to be dump. They're just average hotels that serve a basic purpose without losing standards.However, this place takes the cake for "needs improvement". At the time that I stayed at this location, it appears they were undergoing some renovation. That's fine and all, but upon a closer look it appears the renovation is the "lipstick-on-a-pig" kind.See, here's the thing. You can renovate the front lobby and dining area all you want, but if the walls are fundamentally thin, it doesn't matter how you spin the renovation, a renovation with customer-experience in mind would require more budget and better planning.The walls are so thin here, if someone takes a shower in the room next door, you'll hear it. No, I'm not talking some low volume of water running; that, I'd tolerate. This is as if there is no wall. You can hear the water hitting the floor, someone spitting in the shower, someone singing in the shower. Really really awkward. Now imagine hearing someone doing the you-know at night and screaming about it.Like I said, ain't fun.Reasonable price yes. WiFi decent, yes. Comfortable? Heck no. Find a different Best Western.
