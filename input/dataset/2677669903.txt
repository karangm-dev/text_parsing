I love this little convenience store, I swear some items here are cheaper than buying from wal-mart! But they have some unique snacks from Asia, and England imports  too. My fav is the fruit section, it's like they always stock the freshest in-season and most delicious fruits at a lower price than the supermarket (longos) I also love that there is a huge parking lot at the back of the store which is very convenient, don't have to cross the street or anything.
