Hands down, best jerky!  I bought the Sweet Heat for myself, which was the perfect amount of heat, I ate the entire bag in one sitting!  My son loves the Teriyaki Beef and I couldn't forget my "fur-kids", I bought them a bag of the beef and a bag of the turkey Top Ten dog treats, they went CRAZY for the stuff!  Customer service was awesome too, really cool guys working the shop.  Love this place!
