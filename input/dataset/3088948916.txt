I've only been here once but plan to be back! I had the OMG and all I can say is OMG. That was probably one of the best sandwhiches I've ever had IN MY LIFE! If I wasn't there on a date, I would have made out with it. I'm not scared to admit that. I also had a Mai Tai which was so good as well. Strong enough to be fun but not so strong so that you have to wait for the ice to melt. Maybe if I had a 3rd Mai Tai, I would have made out with the sandwhich. Would be nice though if the staff frequented the patio and took your order. Was kind of a buzzkill to have to go back inside and wait in line to get another drink.
