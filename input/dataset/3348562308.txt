I'm hoping Marcia sees this-- she has my bridesmaid dress and she knows I'm supposed to leave tomorrow for the wedding. It's been 11 days for just a hem... I've left messages with no response. I'm sure she does great work but PLEASE CALL ME! I need my dress, my friend is going to kill me! I'll update my review when I get my dress back. :/
