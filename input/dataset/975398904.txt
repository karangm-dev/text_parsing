This bakery is expensive! Be prepared to spend $15 on a couple buns. I purchased the pineapple bun with a red bean filling and the filling inside was very mushy, wet/moist and did not have any red bean flavor. The worst part of it was when I actually ate the bun, I bit into the filling and it had gone bad! It had gone sour! This is actually supposed to be one of their signature buns... do not buy!
