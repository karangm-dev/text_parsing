Probably not awful but other places in the area have set my bar for bars to high.Similarly priced to the Melt or Fatheads, but not as much choice and not as high of quality.Not much of a beer person, but they had a blueberry something that I was hoping was as good at Fathead's Bumbleberry.  It was not.I had a BBQ chicken sandwich.  Nothing special. I think, despite description to the contrary, that it was just some off the shelf sauce.Got chorizo empanadas for an appetizer.  Not super appetizing.
