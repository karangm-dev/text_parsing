I've given this place so many fair shots because they have a great happy hour and seem like they have potential. The atmosphere is cool, the restaurant's decoration and patio are really neat, they have awesome artwork. The reason I'm over it is because the service is pretty awful. The chips are stale, but they're free, so I'm not that critical and don't need to fill up on free chips anyway.Girlfriend digs the margaritas because they don't taste as 'syrupy' (whatever that means) and because they are half price on happy hour. Tinga tacos ($1.50 each) are good too. We really prefer the other tacos they used to have on happy hour like 6 months ago...consider bringing those back, management.The problem is really that most servers are clueless, irritated that you're in their section and get everything wrong. Pretty consistently, the waitresses seem to be in their first week of their first serving job - forgetting orders, messing stuff up and being awkward.So if you have a lot of patience, are not in a rush and have a lot of great friends with you, this might be an okay choice for happy hour, but there are definitely a lot of better options nearby.
