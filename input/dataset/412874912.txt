A pinball fanatic's paradise.  I love this place.  The machines are well-kept.  The game variety is great.   Not the easiest place to access from the strip (easy to get to, hard to get back from!), but well worth it.So many games.  The staff are geeks (like me!) who love pinball.  We spent a few hours playing to our hearts' content.  I can't wait to go back!
