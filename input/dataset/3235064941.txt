Oh. My. Gosh. I have never had such amazing fried chicken in my life. The breading was amazing and was cooked to perfection. I loved the Mac and Cheese! And my girlfriend loved the chicken biscuits! I got the chicken and waffles, and they were fabulous. I live in Vegas and this was the first time I've been, wish I knew about it sooner!! Only problem I had was the price, but I can't say it wasn't worth it. Must have!!!
