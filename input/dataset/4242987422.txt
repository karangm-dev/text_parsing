Had a small male rattler who just didn't want to leave the rocks by the side of my house. So I called Rattlesnake Solutions and Bryan promptly came out to catch and relocate him. Bryan made quick work of catching and containing the snake. Bryan also went around the property checking for other snakes and took the time to answer my many questions. Very informative and helpful. Will definitely use this company should the need arise again. Price was reasonable and half the fee goes to research.
