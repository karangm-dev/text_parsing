I've been here a couple of times and I really enjoy it here. It's open very late so if you get a crazy Thai craving, come to this place. The food is really good and the wine list is very nice. They let you choose how spicy you want your food, which is great. The restaurant is really casual and simple, and the staff is super sweet. I highly recommend  Chada.
