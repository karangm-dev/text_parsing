This place is Phenomenal! My new favorite vegetarian/Vegan restaurant! The portions are huge! The happy hour pricing makes me even happier, and I have yet to try something I didn' like. My favorite thing on the menu is the street corn, I ask to leave off the cheese (as I have a dairy allergy) and I love how accommodating the staff is to certain diet needs! I also enjoy the fact that they don't use fake meat or fake cheese or anything overly processed in their menu. The vegan pastries are fantastic and the cocktails are to die for!
