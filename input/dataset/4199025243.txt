As a general rule, I'd almost rather stay sick that venture out to an urgent care center. However, when you're on day 4 of a sore throat/ fever that isn't going away, sometimes you have to bite the bullet.So, I stumbled in, signed in & found a seat.  About an hour & a half of feeling like hell and having what seemed like a dozen kids buzzing around my head like gnats, I finally got in to have my vitals taken.  Once that was done, I got to wait another half hour for the doctor's visit, which lasted all of about 5 minutes.  The last step seemed simple- go back up front & the paperwork will be there shortly.  After 10 minutes of patiently (no pun intended) waiting, I finally ask someone at the front desk if they have my paperwork.  She looks around, and hands me the sheets that were sitting about one foot to her left.  Thanks!  All in all, the place is just really, really disorganized, and I wasn't up for 2 hours of waiting, even though I'm all nice & med-ed up.
