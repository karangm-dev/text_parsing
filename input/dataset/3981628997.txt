Stopped by for some food and a cold drink. Waited at the bar for 10 minutes while staff walked around 'looking busy'. No one looked at me or asked if I wanted anything. Bad customer service and rude employees is why this place is pretty empty for a Friday. Upper management must wonder why this location is underperforming compared to other Native locations. Btw I left after 10 minutes.
