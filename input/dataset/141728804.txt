I tried this place on a Saturday at lunchtime when they were not busy, and again on a Saturday at dinner time when they were moderately busy, and both times I had service so poor it was unbelievable. On my second visit, after we waited so long for silverware that our food got cold, I asked for a manager and she was rude and condescending. This was after we didn't get our drinks and our appetizer came out 35 minutes after we ordered it, and it was cold.The food itself is of good quality and the concept of choosing your food and watching them make it is neat, but the service was so terrible I would never go back or recommend this place to anyone.
