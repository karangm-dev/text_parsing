Needed snow tires changed for regular ones I had & a brake check.  Everywhere else in the area would've taken 1 week+ for an appointment. Walked in and done in 20 minutes with no appointment. Originally said it shouldn't cost anything then they charged me $20 for a rotation (which they did) but I didn't expect to have it done for free anyways. Prices for other services were high (oil change $45) but if they're low on customers and you want it done fast this is the place to go. No appointment system available, just walk-ins.
