THEY ALMOST KILLED MY DOG!! I usually don't write reviews because I am busy but this is an exception. I ordered a crate for my dog from Amazon and the delivery person literally THREW the 20 pound package over the fence of my yard while my dog was outside playing!! I yelled at the driver through my window and he just said "You're lucky." He should be glad that it didn't land on my dog or else I would've called the cops and sued the crap out of him!!!
