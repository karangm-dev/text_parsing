Massage therapists are awesome but front desk is terrible.  They called me as I'm driving to my appointment this morning to let me know my therapist wasn't going to make it in today. Sucks but it is what it is.  Then they offered me another therapist , just to turn around and say ooops nevermind , I don't have a therapist in that does prenatal massage.  I was there last week as well and they were VERY pushy with their membership .  The guy tried to sell it to me at least 6 times , after saying repeatedly "but there's no pressure." Not super happy.  Sad that I will have to find a new therapist .
