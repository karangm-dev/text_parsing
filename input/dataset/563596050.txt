Dr. Yau helped lessen my dry eyes and gave me back tears when I formerly had none.  He also improved my vision from 20/600 to 20/350 in one eye.  The ophthalmologist said it was like she was looking at the vision of a different person.  Dr. Yau is also treating me for neuropathy and I have indications that my symptoms are subsiding.  I would much rather have the disease go away than treat it with painkillers, and that is how Chinese medicine works.  Dr. Yau's heart and soul is in his work.  It is surprising how he can help so many seemingly intractable cases.  Diane T.
