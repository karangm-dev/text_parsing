Had my car towed there because I was told on the phone they had a set of take-off tires in very good condition. After my car gets dropped off and I show up - these tires are dry rotted and in horrible shape.Instead I asked them to just switch out the wheels with another set I had temporarily because I did not like my tire options. $60 bucks for some rubber valve stems that cost $1 - this place is a joke and will take advantage of you if you're in a compromising situation.
