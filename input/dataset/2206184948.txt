Andrew Gentile has the most soothing presence.  He is a TRUE HEALER. I have been to him twice and each time he has hit the nail on the head, so to speak!  What I like about the experience is that it gave me a chance to PROCESS the issue that I came to work on before we did the hypnotherapy. Andrew is an excellent listener, and he provides constructive feedback to really help me clearly identify and understand my problem and how to solve it.Andrew is professional.  He provides a digital recording of the session that I added to my iPod so I can listen to it over and over - extremely helpful.Andrew is so good that the effects of the session last for a long time.  Highly recommended!!
