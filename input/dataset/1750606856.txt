Sole', well I had high hopes, even though this was my second time there, and it was for one of my friends birthdays.  We all went out as a big group, and huh, well I am very blase' about this place the food is less than average, the service was good, the location is great, but the food is ... BLAH!  I Had to get extra order of habanero hot sauce for my Pork tenderloin, it looked like a frozen McChicken patty and when they brought out my plate everything was squared off like it was a TV dinner, and it didn't taste better than a Lean Cuisine either.  My girlfriend got the Fideau, basically a Spanish spin on seafood linguine.  And it was so-so as well, uh, if you have the choice I would pass on Sole'.Especially if you are expecting some sort of exotic Spanish food full of spice and pizazz, this place is not it.  Sole' ...No way... Thanks anyway.
