Ordered 2 big dinners here and drove to pick them up. Upon arrival the girl who came out of the restrooms with a broom was pretty rude from the getgo by TELLING me to go to the OTHER register. She brought the BIG shopping bag of food out and I gave her a Bob Evans coupon that was on my phone. She took it upon herself to CAREFULLY read every word and informed me that you could NOT use it to purchase a TURKEY entree ! I could NOT even see all the tiny fine print. So I was counting on the bill being $4 off because I had a valid coupon $4 off $20 . I had another Bob Evans paper coupon with me and asked to use that coupon. She CAREFULLY studied it and said I could use THAT coupon for a turkey entree EXCEPT that is for DINE IN ONLY.  So I let her know that I would have to leave the 2 meals there and I was sorry I could NOT buy them without the $4 coupon being used. She said...O.K. and I will tell you 100% for sure, My family and I always had breakfast here for a LONG time but because of the $4 coupon, I will NEVER,EVER return here due to the TERRIBLE "CUSTOMER SERVICE" and COMMON SENSE that is lacking from this girl. Choose to accept a $4 coupon by manually entering $4 with the help of the manager OR refuse a LEGITIMATE $4 coupon because it "can not be used for a turkey entree" and piss off a customer that will NEVER come back and they LOOSE a BIG SHOPPING BAG OF FOOD now and throw it in the trash. Great Call cashier girl ! Lol
