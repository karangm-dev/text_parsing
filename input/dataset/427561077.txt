First of all,let me say that I used to love this place. Last night we did take-out. Spaghetti with Marinara,Cheese Pizza,and Garlic Knots.  It seems that take-out is not nearly as good as eat-in. The spaghetti was just fair,the pizza,meh,and the garlic knots that I used to crave,had little flavor. Not happy with NYPD at all.
