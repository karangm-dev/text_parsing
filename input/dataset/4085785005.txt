Two stars because the food was edible, but I greatly prefer Olive Garden. I actually found the free wine to be such a joke, because it tasted so watered down! No wonder it's free! But it does have a pretty low key, hole in the wall atmosphere so if you are looking for something like that you would probably enjoy it here. The food is pretty pricey for sub standard Italian fare. Service was good though.
