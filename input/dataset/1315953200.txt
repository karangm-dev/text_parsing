Now, you guys must know we love your food, since we come in sometimes a few times a week..and we don't live close either. It's a 30-45 min drive but it's worth it...when it's made RIGHT. It is worth the money too...but I think they must have lost one of their main chiefs or something because ever since they started training all these new people it became inconsistent every single time. The first time both our cauliflower tacos were so burnt it was stuck together and black...I was left confused why it was even served to us? I didn't even take one bite I was so upset and disappointed. They did take care of us afterwards..but it happened again..and then once again just the last time I ate here. I love this food so I refuse to give it a bad rating and I know it's not really their fault...it's who ever is cooking. And I'm also tired of them forgetting the pumpkin seeds!! That's my favorite part!! Still love y'all. Just step up your game. I'll never take your food for granted again when you fix this
