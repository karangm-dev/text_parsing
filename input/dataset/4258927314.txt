Still my favorite buffet every time I visit.  Like another reviewer wrote, if you love Alaskan king crab legs, this is the place to hit.  They were pretty big and already cut in half so digging for the meat was fairly easy.  The creme brûlée goes fast so get it when they come out.  A large selection of food.   Definitely worth the $$$.
