You can't say you've visited Vegas without seeing the Bellagio Fountains. It's such a beautiful sight to see, and the music makes it romantic and memorable. Make sure to see it both during the day and at night. Grab your partner and prepare yourself for a lovely evening. I think we watched them at least four times.
