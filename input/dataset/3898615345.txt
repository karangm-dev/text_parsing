This probably is my favorite Mexican takeout in the Scottsdale area.  They are known for their street tacos, and they didn't disappoint.  The meat is prepared to perfection, and everything is served in large portions.  Their red salsa is FIRE if you like hot stuff.  You can't go wrong with chicken or steak. We will be back very soon!!
