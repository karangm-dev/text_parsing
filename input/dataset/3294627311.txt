I could not have asked for more than AHR Mechanical provided:  Promptness, honesty and value.  Our AC went out on a Sunday.  I called Mike and a technician (Darold)  was at my house in one hour.  Darold was friendly and only sold me what I needed to get the AC running again.  He even commented that he was surprised to see a 12-year-old AC unit running as smoothly as it was!  Clearly, he was not going to try to upsell me like many other companies have.  Darold worked quietly and had the AC working in under 30 minutes.  While the cost of AC repair is ubiquitously exorbitant, AHR offered many discounts.  They also offered a one year warranty on the part they replaced.  I would confidently call them for any other AC repairs we may need and I'd recommend you do the same.
