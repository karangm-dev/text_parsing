This review is long over do, but Christopher Moving is the best. The movers showed up to our apartment 15 minutes early, they were very professional, and finished in two hours. They were fast and efficient. If I ever have to move again; I will hire Christopher Moving again. Just by far the best moving company here in Vegas.
