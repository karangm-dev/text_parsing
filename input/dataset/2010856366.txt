One of the best pet stores I've ever been to.Definitely not one of your regular pet stores like PetSmart or Petco.  The owners were so friendly and personal. The lady working there at the time explained that they make their own treats right downstairs in the kitchen, which you can see from the upstairs! So awesome. My whole family went there to find something for our dog, but unfortunately our dog is allergic to oats, which they bake all of their treats with except for their doggy "pizza" treats.They have a dessert pastry stand on the right as you walk in. I would have loved to take some home for my dog, but they wouldn't have lasted the trip back home. They looked good enough for humans to eat as well though!The owners also had the sweetest black australian shepherd dog named Bella.If you have a dog, you won't regret coming here. Bring your pup too! If they're really good, you may be able to even let them off leash. =)
