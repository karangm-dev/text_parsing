The food was terrible for the price. We ordered fried pickles and they were bland, battered pickle spears. Just didn't expect it to be spears, typically they are pickle chips.  Four total pickle spears for $8.Then we moved to dinner, there was four of us eating and we all ordered medium. The burgers were all well done. Didn't expect for a $17.00 burger that it would come out well done when we ordered medium. The only good part was the fries. Oh and if you want to add bacon is a $2.00 charge.... Keep in mind for a bottle beer it's around $8 and for a draft, mason jar beer is $13. So for two people to eat we spent $80.00 for a not so great meal....... not worth it for the price!! Definitely wish we had waited in line for a highly rated $30 buffet within the same casino area!
