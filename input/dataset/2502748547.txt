This company replaced the opener motor last year. Initially they charged way too much, and ended up issuing a partial refund of a couple hundred dollars. Last night just after 5p the garage door wouldn't open, so I called them as I thought it could be related to the new opener.  The guy tells me both springs are broken.  He charged $375 to install two new springs, and it took him less than an hour.  In just researching the average cost of parts and labor for two springs, the average cost is $180-$250.  Wow.  As you can see, significant OVERCHARGING is a common practice with these people.  Do yourself a favor and find someone else.  I wish I would have done my research first, though it's pretty inconvenient when someone is there and can do it and you don't have time to research and eff around trying to schedule someone.  It'd be nice if this company had integrity and charged fair market value.
