I have made my last trip to this place.  A more fitting name would be The Original House of Rules...I ordered scrambled eggs and sausage...asked what it came with...they said potatoes or toast...I asked if I could substitute fruit for the starch (something I never get resistance on anywhere else)...no...so I opt for rye toast...they say whole wheat...I guess that will have to do...and ordered the small portion of fruit on the side for $3.75...bananas and strawberries...what, no melon - its definitely in season?  No melon...strawberries and bananas.  No cell phones (which doesn't bother me - I always leave my phone in the car when I dine)...no credit or debit cards...just cash...no gift cards...just cash.  And if you didn't know about that rule and don't have enough, you can step up to the Original ATM Machine and pay $2.50 to get the cash to pay the bill.  Maybe its just me, but I'm used to establishments being a little more customer friendly and flexible.   The food was just okay.  Not even close to good enough to justify all the rules and inflexibility.
