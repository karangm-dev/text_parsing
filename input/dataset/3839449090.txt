Went here for me and my boyfriends anniversary and it was so awesome. Our waiter, Joe, was honest with me when I asked him what his favorite cocktails were, and his favorite entree. He recommended the pineapple mojito which was delicious and the shepherds pie, which was probably one of the best meals I've had out to eat ever! Awesome service and food :)
