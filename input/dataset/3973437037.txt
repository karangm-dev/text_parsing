I would not say this is the worst beauty supply store in the city .. But disappointed at their service and product line..!!!!Why is so many stuff that was outdated and ripped open like it was used before.??? I have gotten a hair which I paid 150$ (cheaper than any other location) but when I got home it was matted and smell like someone had used it before...left me wondering :: am I wearing something that had been on someone else's head???It's not worth it...
