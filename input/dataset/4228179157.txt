We had a group of 20 and it was easily accommodated. We were split into two tables but right next to each other. Our host took care of our seating and meal arrangements. EVERYTHING was sooooo good! I had a pleasant experience at this restaurant. It's located inside of the Venetian. WAGYU on everything! Lol! It was soo tasteful and the texture was like no other. Let's just say, the more you gamble, the more you get comped.
