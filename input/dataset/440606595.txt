I waited for an awesome meal at a place I visited over a decade ago.  I remember the prime rib, crab and seafood from before but I was disappointed in the selection this time. It had more Chinese, Mexican and fruits than I remember.  I saw no real potatoe dishes other than mashed.  Sushi wasn't good.  However the prime rib as great, crab was abundant and calamari excellent.  Pre-made salads were not good.  My husband is a meat and potatoes and he barely found stuff to eat.  I would like to see a price that matches the lack of selection.  I would like to see more sushi that tastes good and more hot crab than cold crab.
