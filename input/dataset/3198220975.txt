This place is not closed- but I assume it may have been since they had a pile of old unbelievably bad looking mattresses out back- dozens- I think a pic would have been censored it was so disgusting. If those mattresses are any indication of cleanliness then RUN don't walk from this place! Room we were shown had lots of interesting "stains" on the comforters.Decor looked like something from goodwill 40 years ago...Light bulbs hang on a cord in kitchenette- you get the picture. Not clean- yuck. Anyone who gave this place 5 stars must live in a trailer by the river without plumbing- then I guess it's a great place.Read Yelp and take its advice for heavens sake.....To attempt to stay here for moms or dads day at uiuc is a very bad idea I think- you want good memories not this.
