Mixed review.. My regular salon is closed on Sundays. Went there and the guy did everything he could to make me happy. Nails looked great when I left the salon.. 2 hours later not so much. They didn't have glitter tips so he polished the tips glitter and did a gel topcoat, gel did not hold so now I just look like a 2 year old painted my nails but as far as customer service they did great.   Hate to leave a bad review bit hate not getting what I paid for!
