FINALLY, a Shawarma place that's serves Shawarma that tastes as good as the one's I've had in Berlin. The food is made-to-order and cooked up right in front of you. The cooks will even offer you samples of the chicken and steak. Both are delicious, but I think the steak is more flavorful and juicier. My friend and I aren't big steak fans, but we both chose to order the Steak Shawarma Wrap. If you're not a meat fan, you can opt for the falafel instead. In addition, we ordered a side of falafels called Falafel-Five.Despite our giant appetites, my friend and I could barely finish our pita bread steak wraps because they're huge, but so, so GOOD! The steak wraps are stuffed with veggies and a dip of your choice. You can even spice it up a bit with some of their freshly made spicy sauces. Also, this comes with a small side of pickled carrots which nicely complement the Shawarma.

I think this is good enough to eat on its own as a meal. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eUuKXhloFVHdQsLdodcLbw?userid=epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg#csxzEmM6ytsnRh6l-0mBeg)Service at Parsley is terrific. The staff's helpful and answered any questions we had about the menu. They even offered us to-go containers for the Shawarma halves that we couldn't finish. I like this because some places will charge you extra for containers if you decide to dine-in than take-out (LAAAME).Lastly, Parsley has stamp cards! As I've mentioned in other reviews, I love stamp cards, so this place receives an automatic star just for that!All I can say is, thanks, Parsley Mediterranean Grill, for your delicious Shawarma wraps that I can't resist.
