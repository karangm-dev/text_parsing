I didn't listen to the low reviews, I wish I did. Literally the worst. We went through two of their routers that both broke. One didn't get us anywhere near the speed we were paying for, I called and chatted with multiple people before we could get a replacement router. Finally got the replacement and things seemed okay, but no it completely broke in less than a month. It won't even turn on anymore. They suggested we go buy a new router from Best Buy, who btw doesn't sell dsl routers anymore wtf!? They charge you ridiculous shipping prices for the replacement for their item that doesn't work properly! Every time you chat with them you get different answers and they transfer you to about 10 people before they even get close to answering your question. Do not use this service, it might be cheaper but not cheap enough to deal with all this BS they put you though.
