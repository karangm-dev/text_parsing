I have been coming to this place for years but their menu has evolved significantly and I just went here tonight so probably the best time to write a review. Atmosphere and decor are great. Short rib taco: ultimate classic. Wish the cheese was cheesier like back in the day but the juiciness and taste of the rib is unparalleled Vegan taco: yummy and spicy with lots of veggies. Seasoning is on point and it was so warm. Baja fish: the slaw makes it and the fish is so soft but flavourful. Soft taco is perfect for this. Shrimp taco: amazing - very mild. Would like to now try the spicy shrimp on the soft shell but the hard shell went so well though! Duck quesadilla: our wonderful waitress Jesse recommended these - they were GOOD but they weren't my personal favourite. Service was amazing and Jessie ensured we were taken care of. Never too far away when we needed to bug her for something. She was so pleasant and easy to communicate with. 5 stars because this is definitely one of the most solid Mexican restaurant choices you will find in Toronto and I've been to a number of them in the city. Tacos are always warm, drinks are tad bit expensive but they're delicious and guac is on point. Great for date night, groups, or just a night out.
