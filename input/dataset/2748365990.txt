Beds don't fit Canadian mattresses. We have been completely misled and have been trying to return a bed back to the store for a week and Muji has been asking us to pay for returning the bed! Calls are not answered, messages are not returned and staff don't seem to know what mujis operating procedures areUpdate - 9 months later Muji refuses to refund me the pick up money owed. Additionally Muji claimed that dimensions in store, catalog and online are for "guidance" only when there was no commentary like that anywhere
