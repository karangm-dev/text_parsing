Ross is one of those discount stores that hit or miss. Sometimes you find great deals and sometimes the place is just trashed.  I roll the dice every time I hit a Ross.  But today, here to get some shirts for my son, the only person actually friendly with the staff was the security guard who "welcomed" us into the store.  Murielle, the checker, may have been having a bad day but she was not friendly at all.  Yelling very aggressively "next in line" not in a high volume so customers can hear but more aggressive like irritated she had to check out the line of people waiting.  Once there she didn't address us and removed the hangers from the clothes by tossing them onto the counter, even hitting my hand as I was leaving on the counter.  Then asking cash or card, irritably and then screamed next in line after I began paying.  As I was paying she finished bagging up the clothes and tossed them at me. Covering my hand again as I was putting my numbers into the debit machine.   I'll try to avoid this store in the future, no reason for any employee of any kind of store to treat customers so aggressively and irritably.  Thanks for the couple of discounted shirts Ross I'll spend the extra doe and go somewhere else where I get treated like a human.
