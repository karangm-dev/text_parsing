I used to like this place a lot.  The choice of ingredients is better than Chiptole; the fresh cilantro is awesome.  But I've been there a handful of times over the past couple years, and I have not had a decently rolled burrito once.  Every once and a while I go back to see if they got someone that knows how to roll a burrito.  They never do.  Its always sloppy and falling apart.  The employees are just a disaffected as the ones at Chipotle, but at least they can roll a burrito there.On the plus side, I think their Mexican Pizza is still good, and the platos are a great deal.  $6 for a huge mound of food.   I think they give you more in the to go box also. That thing will last you like 3 meals if you have corn chips at home.
