I went to phase one for the first time with Natalee Torres to get some purple foils. I was very happy with my service!  I have very dark hair and she spent the time to make sure my hair got light enough to take the full vibrancy of the purple I was going for. Instructor (Lonnie) was great. He was always available when needed! This of course can be very reassuring to some clients but it also made for a great learning environment. I'd recommend this place to anybody looking for any service on their hair and anyone looking to go into cosmetology school. Remember they are students so dont set an appointment if you are going to be in a hurry. And of course ask for Natalee T. in phase one!!
