Came to this restaurant unexpectedly. My boyfriend and I were just looking for a quick place to eat and stumbled in with not very high expectations. This place was surprisingly great! The restaurant interior has a good vibe, a great music playlist, the cooks handmake the noodles, and the staff was very friendly. The menu is pretty simple, but has great options. We started with the shrimp, pork, and vegetable wontons which came with mung bean noodles. These were DELICIOUS!!! My boyfriend then got the dan dan noodles Szechuan style. These were great and filling. I got the braise minced pork over rice. This was great and the portion was very large for the price of only 7$! I am very pleased with my visit and will definitely come back again. Ps: I am even happier to see that this place delivers!!!
