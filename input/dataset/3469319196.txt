Came in today at about 10:15 am dropping off two packages with labels already created. I come about once a month doing the same thing although this location was the rudest one I've ever came to. A girl with red hair looks at my packages and starts off with "we can't help you" I look at her confused not sure what to say. She then goes on pointing at the package saying this is their competitors package and I need to drop it off at a fed ex and then she starts smiling and laughing. Terrible customer service. Fed ex was happy to assist me afterwards.
