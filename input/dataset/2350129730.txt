The visiting vet is amazing. Unfortunately I cannot remember the name of the female vet who helped our dog Monty. He had chronic ear and skin problems, licked his paw all the time.  Also constant shaking his head and digging his head into the ground because of ear discharge causing him discomfort and a later hematoma. We had been to several different vets and many antibiotics, foot baths, steroids, drops and various other things. He would get a bit better and then symptoms would come back. Finally I was referred to  the Visiting Vet. After one appt sent me home with 4 meds and he was better and has been ever since. They also called to follow up on how he was which was so nice. We are so thankful to VV for helping our now happy, healthy Monty he's like a new dog and we are grateful.
