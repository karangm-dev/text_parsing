This is one of my favorite make your own pizzas in Charlotte. I know the concept is widespread and there are several of these types of restaurants to choose from, but I definitely think you get your moneys worth here and I feel like the quality is just a step up from the others.The pizzas are around $10 which I feel is pretty on point for the average make your own pizza place... Maybe a dollar or two more, but it's definitely worth it. They have several different sauces to choose from and although I've tried several the pesto is my favorite! They do a good job of not over powering the sauce, but if you're into that you can definitely ask them to add more.They don't have a super rough wide selection of cheeses, but I feel going with the shredded mozzarella and a fresh mozzarella is always a win! I mean if you're getting a pizza in there is an option for mozzarella and you're not getting it... What are you doing with your life?!They have a great selection of toppings... I wouldn't say anymore or any less than other places and the ones I always seem to get it always taste and look fresh! The pizza is more of a rounded edge rectangle shaped and I feel like you definitely get much more or at least it seems quite a bit bigger when I'm eating it compared to the round ones you typically get at these restaurants. They are quick and the line tends to move fast if they are super busy! There isn't a ton of space for sitting down to eat inside and the tables are quite thin, but I'm not going to judge the place too much on that. So to conclude, if you're looking for a good pizza that can be made quickly for you to sit and enjoy right there or take home and eat... This is the place for you! Man, I'm getting hungry just thinking about my next visit to them!
