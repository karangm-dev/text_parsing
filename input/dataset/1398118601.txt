This company is a joke. Highly highly recommend you to choose a different company. Rented a limo for a night out with friends my sisters first time to Vegas so I said yea let's rent a limo we can cruise the strip drink and have fun.  The driver was 30mins late picking us up we called and asked hey where is the driver and was told he would be there within 15mins. In the booking I had requested extra glasses, ice and bottled water when the driver finally arrived we get in the limo and you can tell someone had just got out the glassware was all dirty cups on the floor the ice was used. I told him to pull into CVS at the corner so we could buy fresh ice and cups which he took us blocks away to a 7-11 so he could buy his own snacks. Than I said let's head to Fremont he jumps on the freeway and is going like 70 we are sliding all around in the back. After Fremont we tell him to take us to the Vegas sign again hops on the freeway we get to the sign the car stops and we are waiting for the doors to open well after a few minutes we look around and he is across the road talking on his phone I get out the other door is on child lock so I have to go around and open the door. After the Vegas sign we tell him just to cruise the strip up and down he could not even get that right he took back roads and alleys the whole time finally we gave up and told him just to drop us off 45mins early. We called the next day and complained and was told there were cameras in the vehicle it would be reviewed and the manager would call us back. He did call back two hours later and kept apologizing he also said give us a decent rating on yelp and I will refund you half of the trip total. Never have I received a penny back and this was back in November 2017. Please do yourself a favor skip this company.
