While scoping out all the cafeteria- line style food vendors and passing on all of their artery-clogging options, I stumbled across Beaudevin.  So glad I did.  But giving up wine for Lent and sitting in this place is like forcing a crack addict to sit in a crack house... Anyway, got the Spinach salad with grilled chicken.  Simply delicious.  Nice layers of egg, bacon, red onion, Pt. Reyes blue cheese, and tossed with olive oil.  Yum.  This place is truly an oasis on the airport food scene.  But wait there's more... They have individual I Pads at the bar that you can freely use.  And there are electrical outlets under the bar to keep your devices going strong.  Bravo.
