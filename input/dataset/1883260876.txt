Unfortunately, due to the recent change of staff, service has not been top notch lately. When I used to go, I was always treated well by the owners, and given a smile every time I walked in. Recently, the service has been quite the opposite. About a month ago, I went here to buy some ice. I had given a ten dollar bill for the three dollar bag of ice, and only received two dollars from the cashier. I kindly told the man that he had basically ripped me off, and that he still owed me five dollars. He denied that I had given him a ten dollar bill, and then refused to give me my five dollars back. After several minutes of arguing for my money back, I finally got my five dollars back. This wasn't before I was the basically told to get lost, except the language that was used against me was alot more aggressive and completely unprofessional. I definitely won't be back here for any future service, as I do not believe that customers should be called innapropriate names, or ripped off.
