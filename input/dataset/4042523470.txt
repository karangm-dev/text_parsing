This is the worst restaurant ever!  We ordered the Mac-N-Cheese burger and I swear there was like a tablespoon of Mac-N-Cheese on the whole burger!  They give you like 5 fries and they were like crumbs.  Our waitress Brooke G was horrible! We had a party of 7 and split the bill 2 ways.  We had a total of 6 pending charges on our cards.  2 are still pending and an incorrect amount has already been posted to my account.  I called and spoke to Chris who is the restaurant Manager and he was useless!  I told him that Brooke charged me an additional $70 and all he could do was refer me to billing who is not open on the weekends.  I told him that they are giving this restaurant a bad name and that I should post a review on Yelp to help other customers avoid going through the same thing.  All he said was: do what you gotta do
