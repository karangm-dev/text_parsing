Popped over for breakfast before our wreath making class at The Ribbon Store. We got there around 10 on a Saturday and there was a table for 2 available. Daughter tried the strawberry crepes and was rewarded with three fresh thin French pancakes filled with strawberry deliciousness. They were topped with sliced strawberries and whipped cream. She thought they were delic, I tried a bite and agree.I ordered huevos rancheros, no potatoes with the eggs scrambled and they were fantastic. A little bit of heat, the ranchero sauce was just right. I think next time I'd add some chorizo too.Our server was super fast and friendly, I'd request her again next time. I'm always looking for a great breakfast spot, glad to find one.This is not a fancy franchise, it's in a strip mall, but the food is good. If you are looking for a swanky brunch spot this isn't your bag.
