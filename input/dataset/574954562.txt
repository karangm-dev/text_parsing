Very rude when checking in. It was booked through a 3 party and when they didn't see my name on the reservation they gave me a huge attitude and took the next person without giving me time to call them and fix the issue. Treated me like I wasn't important and they could care less about my reservation. Got that issue fixed dealt with a different person at the front desk and when a second issue arrived with their pet policy (it doesn't say anywhere there is a limit and the party that booked me swears they told them it was more than one dog) they shoved my stuff back at me and told me their canceling the reservation before I could even make a phone call. I was super polite the whole time trying to be understanding but I definitely felt talked down to and that they didn't care about the reservation at all even though it was paid in advance. Worst customer service I have ever gotten at a hotel and I travel for a living.
