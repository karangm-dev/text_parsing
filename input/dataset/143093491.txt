I've been to this restaurant before on a Sunday afternoon and quite enjoyed it so thought we would give it another try....never again! We were there on a Saturday night and although it was busy, it was not packed. Our first drinks came quickly along with chips and salsa...which was delicious.  After that we probably didn't see our waitress for about 45 minutes. Our first drinks were long gone...we were starving and had been ready to order well over half an hour prior. We were so disgusted that we decided to just leave but the waitress brought our bill and never returned again. 20 minutes later we eventually settled up with the bar. Graciously the bartender removed one of our drinks. So needless to say the hour and a half wait I experienced was not worth the 1 mediocre Margarita! Went next door to the American pub and told our story..the staff was all over us. The manager even comped our first round of drinks and appetizers without us even asking!!! Now that's were I will frequent
