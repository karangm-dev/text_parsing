I was surprised to see this hotel pop up as 4 stars, usually us West-Siders have to go all the way downtown or to Scottsdale for a nice hotel.  Seeing as I go to Westgate often, I thought, 'what the heck, it's my anniversary'.  Well, was I surprised to see this beautiful hotel with a stunning water feature inside, amazing service, and a great restaurant.  Immediately the woman at registration upgraded us to a king sized bed, even though that was a more expensive option online.  As she checked us in and we were chatting, we found out there was an event at the Cardinals stadium next door and a dance event there as well, which explained why it was so busy.  When she asked us what brought us in, and we told her it was our 23rd anniversary, she immediately comped us 2 breakfasts in the morning, and waived our parking fee.  I already thought the hotel was worth what we paid for it, but they went so far beyond my expectations, I'll stay again.
