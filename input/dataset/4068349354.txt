Went in today for a ThermaLo with Maria, the owner, and she rocks! Super friendly, super attentive, appropriate etiquette (as I had to undress a little more), and of course extremely knowledgeable! She was training two other women on ThermaLo, great teacher too! Totally recommend Senza Pelo Med Spa! I've gone in for other services in the past as well; April-electrolysis, and Kiara-blow out, always a pleasant experience. Now I see where everyone gets it from, their leader Maria!
