Huge place that is pretty hidden away, kind of sketchy. Plenty of tables and open spot, whether you need to get work done or meet up with some friends. Parking is a bit difficult as it looks like it's mostly street parking.Latte was delicious and they have a great selection of beans they roast. I definitely had to buy some to take home.
