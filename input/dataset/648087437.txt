The good: store was clean.The bad: little to no product, this store, or all store, have removed a lot of product in favor of a Apple Store environment, only there is not much to buy that you want, prices are high for items that are half online, for the amount of staff on duty, I counted 15 on one half of the store, five of which were talking with each other, none were engaging, said hello or seemed to care that you were there.  When asked, one clerk lead me to an item, that I found after a few minutes of looking, told me sorry this is all we have and wandered off.  Save the trip and buy the product online.
