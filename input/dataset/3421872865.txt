Went to the buffet for dinner before the cirque du soleil show. Mistake.  One thing was very  good, the iced tea.  That was all.  The Ribs were inedible, the broccoli was under cooked.  There was no salad bar just a place where they made the salad for you, and even that wasn't good, the Cesar dressing had a weird taste to it.  Won't be back here again. Was thinking of staying at Treasure Island on my next trip to Vegas, but not now.
