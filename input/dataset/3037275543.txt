wow....how can it go from so consistent to so BAD!Just returned from a month long trip and needed this shaggy head trimmed. I get the same cut every time, however, like most of these places, I got a different stylist. Everything was going fine and she was pleasant and nice. But when she turned me to face the mirror, damn! The front of my hair looked fine but the back part of my head looked like a little kid had gotten a hold of some scissors and simply cut a large swath of hair randomly off the top of my head! She basically made my hair look like I live in a wood shack in the Appalachian mountains.But you can't fix it. I mean, I would have to buzz cut the whole thing! When I came home my wife said "what the hell?" and then my in laws snickered.
