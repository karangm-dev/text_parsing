I came in for a couples massage for my birthday yesterday (12/14). My therapist was Kyra and my fiancé's therapist was Sarah. I've been frequenting this spa for many years and always receive a great massage & great service, hence why I always come back. Kerry is great, Heather is great and my fiancé said that Sarah was great. Unforunately, yesterday was one of the worst massages I've ever had. :( It felt very rushed and didn't quite feel like a "professional" massage. I think my therapist Kyra forgot to trim her nails because I could feel her nails digging into the back of my neck and that's all I could think about. I always get deep tissue massages so my pain tolerance is high. I carry a lot of tension in my shoulders and neck area and we both have issues with our sciatic. After my massage, I asked Kyra of possible techniques that I could do to alleviate some of the tension and her best reply was "to drink water or lots of lemon water". Thankfully, Sarah was very helpful and literally showed us a few good stretches to help other than drinking lemon water. In addition, hours after my massage, I had a little discomfort in the back of my neck. I had my fiancé look at the back of my neck and he saw a pretty decent size scratch on my neck, from where Kyra was digging with her nails. In addition, they forgot to give us locals discount and the bottled waters were warm, there was no ice and the bins for the robes and towels were overflowing. I'm not sure if management has changed recently, but this place needs some TLC. I'm going to try the M Resort for my next service. I hear great things about them.
