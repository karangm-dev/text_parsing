I really can't say thanks to this place enough.  When I was a youth growing up in the wastelands of North East Ohio, there weren't exactly a lot of options for food.  You could go to McDonalds...or a McDonalds clone.  TGIFridays...or a Fridays clone.  Thankfully, when I was 16 or so I discovered this place.  Thanks for diversifying my palate, Empress Taytu.  You remain the standard I judge other Ethiopian restaurants against to this day, 15 years later.
