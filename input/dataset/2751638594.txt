I would expect at least a good tasted coffee from a place named "coffee trader" but their iced coffee drinks tasted yuk, not even meeting the average expectation. Mine was a sweet one (Iced Mocha) and I could manage to finish it. My wife's was not sweet (Iced Coffee) and she threw it away after sipping a couple of times. I am usually reluctant to throw food/drink away and so I tried to take over hers. But I agreed with her after sipping once. The coffee (probably only iced ones) had a strange disgusting smell and taste. I tried this place and Bradbury's Coffee on the same day. Bradbury's was way better. Not even comparable.Probably they focus more on selling wines?
