I was in town visiting for a few days and wanted to get my time in because from what I cam remember SWINA was a very calming and welcoming experience. I was about 15 minutes late because I went to the wrong location. But the ladies there refused to check the schedule to see of there was anything else available and didn't even attempt to look at the schedule to reschedule. I was brushed off with a superficial "sorry" and they continued to chit chat amongst themselves...this place certainly has changed. Too bad because it used to be a pleasurable experience.
