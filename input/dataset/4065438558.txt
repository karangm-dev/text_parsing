The Twins are fabulous! I purchased my Valley home from them and sold it with their guidance years later. Not only do they ensure you get the best deals coming and going, they put their personal touch on everything they do. Jenny's hand-holding, high availability, action-oriented approach made me feel secure every step of the way. Christie oversaw paperwork on the backend and came to the closing with a therapy Chihuahua and champagne. Perfect! They have the best minds in Real Estate but also know how to make the process fun. Now I can't wait to buy my next house with these sensational superstars!
