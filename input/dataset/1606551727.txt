Horrible and it gets worse every time I go I swear it will be the last time.  No a/c in the building, still serving customers.  Shift manager Adrianna?? says she is doing everything she can, but really is she?  I asked for the general managers name and she refused to give it to me.  I pay to sit down and eat in comfort so my grandson can play in the play area, I expect a/c when it is 120 degrees outside.  I am going to write to corporate about this place.  Maybe need some new shift managers?
