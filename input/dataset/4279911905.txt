I called the "Hotel Doctor" last night. Told him my issue and he asked me to hold on. After about 10 minutes of having me on hold he must have decided my cash wasn't as green as someone else's because I was hung up on.  The ER happily took my money and helped me out. The hotel doctor is a joke that just wants to overcharge desperate tourists. What a horrible way to run a business!
