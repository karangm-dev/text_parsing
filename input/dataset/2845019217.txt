I started to get my nails done here a couple months ago and the service was great! & tony was one of coolest nail techs he was actually the reason why i continue to go the salon but i notice the last couple times my nails were not great. So today i specificly requested for tony to give me a full set and the girls at the front desk told me to choose a color and he will be with me. I patiently waited for about 35mins and a nail tech i did not request for sat me in her station and made me wait another 20 mins. While the tech i requested proceeded to do someone else's full set It was extremely rude and today was definitely my last time coming ! I requested coffin shape nails- i said it 3 times and she gave me square nails my nails are not what i asked for! and they're uneven! Never went back and never is .
