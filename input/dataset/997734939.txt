I thought I'd give this place another chance. To start service is everything. During my last visit I was not greeted, i was giving the attitude that I was an "inconvenience" to the two workers there. I ordered fried rice, & mushroom chicken.  Rice was dry, not much flavor. The mushroom chicken was a bit better but yet I've had better. The cashier talked to her co worker and paid no attention while I waited to hand her my signed receipt slip. No thank you and she walked alway. Yes real pleasant. This was about 6 months ago. Now for today's visit...  There was again two females working at around 4PM. Still no greeting, still given that look as if they were interrupted again. She didn't ask if I wanted my meal take out or dine in but I did say take out. I ordered a bowl and she handed me my food without a lid. I kindly asked for a lid and she gave a big sigh like it's so damn had to put a lid on a bowl!  Walked on over to the cashier who was taking with that rude server. No hi, no do you need anything else, I asked for a bag and she just handed it to me. Yes it must be VERY difficult to bag my meal as well. No thank you. This place is seriously a joke. I'm going to do both these rude workers and myself a favor by not returning.  It's just a fair warning, unless you want to be served food that's less than average while being served by people with attitudes just as bad, I'd avoid this place. There's much better out there.
