I fly this airline from Phoenix to Montana - the only nonstop option - it's usually NOT on time but still saves time to get there!The complaint I have is that they don't answer their phones - -I FINALLY was on hold for nearly two hours to figure out a credit of $352 that I had with them -- their website doesn't hold your credit and you can't use it on line!  I was literally a day after the expiration date and they chose to do NOTHING regarding the missing $352 - they just kept my money!  I will NEVER fly them again or recommend them again just for this reason - clearly they could have given me vouchers for part of the money that I had in credit - they offered NOTHING!
