definitely the best barro's location i've been to!! it's always consistent, clean, pleasant employees with great customer service! they can be crazy busy and still be smiling and attentive. i usually get a veggie pizza, veggie salad or cheesy bread which has all been SUPER bomb! it's nice to go here and watch a football game sometimes to take a break from the busy loud sunday football bars. i miss living in tempe and by this location! no other ones compare.
