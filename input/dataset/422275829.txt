We set up an appointment for 445 for new born photos. My husband called a few days before, and even asked on the original phone call what the latest appointment could be. Today when we showed up at 450 (full disclosure we were late) they had already closed down the studio. The employee who was supposed to take our picture saw us and came back. She explained they closed at 5, and all appointments are only 15 minutes long. Then she back tracked and said new borns always get an hour. But we set up a new born appointment, they left before closing, and clearly had no intention of keeping our appointment. New born photos are time sensitive, this was really frustrating.
