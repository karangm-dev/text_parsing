I've come here once before 2 years ago and it was mediocre... but i came back to give it another chance.Our group of 6 was put into that little bird cage thing in the corner. Let me warn you, they WILL forget about you if you do. Appetizers consisted of the turnip cake + jellyfish/chicken.Entrees we all ordered pretty much wonton soup/dumpling soup with one order of the panfried noodles.It took over 30 minutes for a simple appetizer to come out. Entrees took another 15 on top. The dumpling soup i ordered tasted like it came out of a instant noodle package. The pan fried noodles my friend ordered were SOAKED in grease and just wet.We had to pop our heads out to get our servers attention since we probably only saw him twice.Mediocre service, Mediocre food, 7 dollars for jasmine Tea, and another bad experience. I will pass on Red 8. Never again.
