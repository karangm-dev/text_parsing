As a resident of Bloor West Village, I've walked by this place a couple of times, but didn't have a cookie craving, so I hadn't been in.  That all changed when a friend and I decided to go in have some tea, a cookie and a lovely catch up.We totally enjoyed ourselves.  They have a tea I fell in love with about a year ago (10,000 mysteries), and such an awesome selection of cookie stuff.I had them make me an oatmeal cookie with dark chocolate and macadamia nuts.  My friend had an oatmeal cookie with dark chocolate and peanut butter.  They were both delicious.  As were the various samples of other cookie permutations they had on offer.  I'll likely go back and try the muffin tops...I've been wanting to figure out how to make my own!!!
