My son and I went to "The Meg" at the Red Stone Cinemas and felt like we pretty much wasted our money. We saw the PDX version (Premium Digital Experience) which, according to what they told us at the ticket counter, was better sound and 3D effects. The only thing that was intense (in a good way) about it was the sound was better, but the picture part of it was not worth the $38 that we paid for.  $38 for one adult and two kids....totally not worth it. Plus, the price for food at theaters now is absolutely ridiculous!!!  For the three of us, including the cost of the tickets was over $65. It pretty much costs as much as dinner would cost at a 5-Star restaurant. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about the movie. The movie was great, very suspenseful. The amount that it cost, however, was totally not worth it!!  We feel like we definitely got ripped off at this theatre!!
