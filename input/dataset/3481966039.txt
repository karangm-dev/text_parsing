This guy is a total DOUCHE NOZZLE!!! He swindled my 70yr old dad out of a couple grand, he claims he rebuilt the transmission, but when you looked at the transmission bolts the grease on three bolts was still on them! The bolts hadn't even been busted which means he did NO work on the transmission! Now my dad is without transportation. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU NOT, REPEAT, DO NOT GO THERE!!!!!! He likes to take advantage of old folks and probably women as well!! WORST place to EVER GO to have your vehicle repaired!!! And to top it off corporate won't even take care of the problem and says their hands are tied! NEVER GO TO AAMCO!!! You'll get screwed! You're Better off goin to a shade tree mechanic!! Just tryin to save you some money and time.
