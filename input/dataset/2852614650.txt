Price Range (per person): $11-$25 Visit Again?: No Party Size: 2 Hostess was very nice. Server was great. Nacho presentation was very nice. Taste was horrible.Please Wendel, get rid of that pasty cheese like mixture you're using. That stuff is truly awful. The only thing I can think of is that you've never tasted good nachos or that you've not tasted these ones. There are many restaurants/bars in the Toronto area that have good nachos. Two examples are Southside Bistro in Markham and The Foggy Dew in Toronto.There were also about 3 times the number of hot peppers on these nachos as compared to other places; way too many and I like hot peppers.And the chili we added on as a 1.99 extra. At first we wondered if it had been left off the order and asked our server if this was the case. It was not. Pulease..... 20 kidney beans and about the same number of 1/4" diameter balls of hamburger do not a chili make.Ok, so we didn't eat about 1/2 of the platter and complained. The server said she would get the manager. He came over and talked to us about our experience and offered us $10 in Wendel bucks. Nice but since we're not going back I gave them to someone at the bar.Too bad, so sad. And it is sad, because you've got a good setup there and I would like to think it's not just a business for you based on your name appeal but that you're providing something of value to your customers as well. For this dish, I would say the value I got was $2 for presentation, $10 for tortilla chips, tomato, peppers and lettuce, 3 cents for the chili, and minus $12 for the cheesy guk.So please, Wendel, for the love of all that's holy, change the way you're making those nachos.
