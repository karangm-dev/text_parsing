We've had a few experiences with vets that we weren't so pleased with, so feel very grateful to have found Humber Bay Vet.Dr Ibrahim is amazing! He's very kind, caring and extremely knowledgeable; we completely trust him with our pups. He goes above and beyond and doesn't try and push unnecessary products and treatments as many do.Would definitely recommend!!EDIT: we were very sad to find out that Dr Ibrahim has left and there is no information as to where or if he is still practicing :(
