Amazing!I live in Napa,CA, so my standards are pretty high, and this restaurant met them in spades.We went on a Sunday for lunch, when they had Football specials, which was nice. Our two sushi rolls were amazing, and they were half price.The clam chowder competes with some of the best I've had elsewhere. Same goes for the mussles in the delish broth. I would recommend springing the extra $5 for the extra garlic bread to get every ounce of the broth.Beers were a hot 2 bucks, which was definitely a plus for our lunch.Definitely make this one of your Vegas stops.
