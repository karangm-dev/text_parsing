I booked a day trip for two on Groupon for the Grand Canyon South Rim tour. This is the worst organized tour company I have ever seen.  I made reservations one week in advance - 24 hour advance reservation was required. I was told to be outside my hotel at 6:15am on the morning of our tour. We were there a 6:05am. I called at 6:26am, and was told the driver was about 10 minutes away. Called back a second time at 6:45am and was told by Rosie that the driver was on his way back from dropping off other customers, but would pick us up and that our tour bus would not leave the station, which was scheduled to leave at 7:30am, without us. You guessed it, by 7:15am, still no driver. I call a third time and was told by a woman named Lee to just take a cab to their bus terminal located at 795 E. Tropicana and I'd be reimbursed. We take a cab which with fare and tip was $11. Pete, the person in charge, would only pay me $10, as they wouldn't pay the can driver $1 tip. .... Nothing was offered for the inconvenience and our wait. It gets better, we are placed on a 40 passenger bus with no working toilet with about 10 passengers. This meant we had to make extra stops for an already long trip. To top things off, the driver, Barry, kept taking his hands off the wheel particularly while we were on the winding roads near Hoover Dam. Not the company to use to see one of the wonders of the world.
