My girlfriend always checks yelp for everywhere we go and we were doubtful after reading some of the reviews but decided to check it out anyways. Upon arrival we were asked if we had any reservations which we did not, and were told would be 20 minutes wait for a table outdoors. It didn't even take that long for a table to become available. My girlfriend ordered a 'Don Quixote' and I ordered the white sangria, both were delicious. We started with the cheese plate and an arugula salad to share - both were delicious.  We had to wait for our main courses for about 35 minutes, but it was worth the wait for such great food. The barbecue ribs were the best I have ever tasted, and my girlfriend loved her grilled tofu as well. We enjoyed our time so much and made reservations to bring our friends next week. Lesson learned? Don't get fooled by whiney customers posting bad reviews! ;)
