Beautiful. They have wonderful paintings. They have gondola rides for both inside & outside. Me, my bro, his gf & my bf took the inside one, because of the lovely paintings & scenery we got to see. Few bridges we got to go under too. Venetian is all about Italy & thats why it looks the way it does. Totally Italy look..I recommend anyone to experience riding the Gondola ride. If you don't, you can still see all the beautiful paintings at this hotel. You have to visit this hotel while visiting Vegas...
