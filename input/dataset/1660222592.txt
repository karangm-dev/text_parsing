We went here after the NFR. Gotta say,  I was pretty disappointed with the service. The food was good, exactly what I'd expect from thehard rock, but the place was nearly deserted and we still had to wait forever for our food. They had items on the menu that were not available. Based on our experience,  I would recommend skipping this one.
