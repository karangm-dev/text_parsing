The description written next to 2 stars in yelp says "Meh. I've experienced better" and that is more accurate than the current yelp rating. I was surprised to see it was so high. Prices must have increased or something since previous postings - it was definitely more than they mentioned paying.Be prepared to wash your own dishes: So not a huge deal I suppose... except that this is a hotel! The best part about staying in a hotel is not having to do dishes. And does that mean that I have to trust the previous guest to effectively disinfect the dishes prior to my use? Plus dish washing liquid was not even provided... so what does that mean? A $25 fee is charged if you do not wash your dishes. Ugh. Kinda tacky. General ambiance: My bathroom sink was cracked and a brownish-yellow tub stopper was provided for the tub. The mattress did not provide much support and the top cover had stains. Sheets appear very clean, though.Location: As a single woman that doesn't speak French well, the "rue" was more of a sketchy alley complete with broken windows, boarded up windows, broken glass and people sleeping on the sidewalks. I know it is not the hotel's fault - but it is something to be aware of. Once you get to the main street near the square, it's much nicer and walking distance to St. Denis - complete with fun/unique restaurants, coffee shops etc.The staff was very friendly - from the room service to the front desk to the breakfast room - everyone was friendly and helpful, so that is a plus!Had the price been a bit less, these things would not have been as surprising.
