Well...After reading the other reviews we decided to give DC a shot for Valentine's Weekend.  Not a good idea.  Once again they were not prepared for the crowd.  We had a 7pm reservation, called in 4 days in advance, and we were seated at 8pm with no menus, no bread, no wine, except us whining that we felt like this was an episode of "Hells Kitchen".  We had to laugh (group of 6) and we were not in a hurry, yet we had to ask for everything, server, wine, another wine, ect...  We finally got bread at 8:22pm, and after the bread the salad, and steaks came out pretty quick, but they could not figure out who's steak was who's...and the three women's steaks were all delivered to the wrong person, one had to be sent back, ordered M.R. brought M.W., not good...brought a new steak Rare...and the same person got shorted wine from the person as they tried to pour to all six  of us from a bottle of wine brought to the table uncorked with the cork in the bottle, not good...All of that on our first visit ever to DC, and they did not offer us anything for compensation, no offer, no nothing..."sorry we are still learning"..."thanks for your patience"..."It's been overwhelming" told to us by our server...It's really too bad, nice place, nice people, my steak was perfect and I love the fact that they serve every steak with sauteed mushrooms...love em, and the price point of the menu is right on...Wine list could be better especially for a "Steakhouse" they are competing with some heavy hitters in the Southeast Valley, they better step it up a bit...Crazy thing is everyone wanted to go back to give them another try when they aren't busy, go figure...not sure I will.
