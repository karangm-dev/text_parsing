First, and foremost, my review is of the dining experience overall so that people who have never been there know what to expect. As cheap sushi goes, it's not terrible. You're definitely not going to like everything on the menu but it's easy to fill up on a couple things that you do like. The portion sizes are decent and the quality is pretty okay. Nothing amazing or life changing about this place. I usually come here for lunch for a quick bite when I don't have time to wait in a nice restaurant. Now, one thing to consider is that the service is horrendous. Oh god, it's awful. You're drink may be refilled once, if you're lucky. But no need to get upset about it. Just be vocal with your requests. It's a nuisance, sure. I too am used to be treated like a damn princess when I dine at a nice restaurant so I get it. Being ignored is annoying. But this is far from a nice restaurant so don't walk in expecting that kind of service. You're just setting yourself up for failure if you do. Instead, just accept that this is the culture of the restaurant and speak up. You're on your own, folks. It's one of those symbiotic relationships where it's like, "I hate you, you hate me but I want your cheap sushi and you want my money despite not really wanting to work for it. If I had wanted five star service, I would've gone to Kabuki and you know that you cheap whore. I knew exactly what this was when I walked through the door. "So yeah. That's the Teharu experience in a nutshell.
