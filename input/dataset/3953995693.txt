Umm yeah, great coffee shop if you want to get shot or mugged getting there lol I didn't even feel comfortable leaving my car in that parking lot. The coffee was good, great open space. The outside of the building looks shabby, there are weeds all around the front door and windows. A building should be maintained inside and out but maybe they wanted the building to fit in with the area. Do not come here with anyone to have a conversation. All the tables are huge and shared. Everyone there is on a laptop, and it feels like your interrupting everyone when all you want to do is catch up with a friend. Honestly, not worth it for what it is.
