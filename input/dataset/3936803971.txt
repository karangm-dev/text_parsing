I can't believe that if you want to buy a whole cheesecake you can only take it to go. If you want to eat in the cafe you can only buy slices, and of course pay tip. I got their matcha latte; overpriced and just okay. I also got their original cheesecake and.... It was SO disappointing. It was kind of bland actually, didn't have much of a cheese flavor or sweet taste, and kind of dry towards the bottom. I've had Japanese cheese cake in Toronto much much better than this, like ten-fold, but I won't mention the place here. Sorry uncle Tetsu, but you have been a disappointment. I just expected better.
