I love this place. I love their chicken fried rice, been coming to pick up for years now. Almost on Sandra Bullock in Two Weeks Notice status. No vegetable, only chicken and egg. Trying to cut back on grains and carbs, but my God does their fried rice craving hit me all the time. Their Walnut Shrimp is also okay but maybe too much tempura. Their Fried Wontons put everyone else to shame, though. Crab Rangoon also delicious, sometimes a little overdone but as far as affordable chinese food goes, I gladly drive the hike up Green Valley to their location by the 215 just for them even though Amlee is across the street (btw, Amlee- NEVER AGAIN). Love China Tango! :)
