The food here is NEVER fresh, you can tell it all sits under heat lamps.. too many times I have ordered food without mustard or without mayo to have it slathered all over my order. The salads usually have wilted lettuce and a foul smell...  I now drive the extra few miles to go to the one on baseline and rural. I agree with the previous review.. they have let me down time and time again.
