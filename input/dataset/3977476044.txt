I loooove this place. I always get their banh mi with egg and some juice or smoothie. They have the best drinks and the presentation is amazing. They add fresh fruit to the top and little pieces in your juice, seriously so refreshing and delicious. They also have boba tea which is nice but I personally am not a huge fan. They also have smaller plates with popcorn shrimp, fries, sweet potato fries. A lot of people come here to do homework and relax. They have a little couch area in the corner.
