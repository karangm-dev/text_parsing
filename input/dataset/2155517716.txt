I have wanted to see this ever since I turned 18 because I am fascinated by the idea of sophisticated nudity.  Anyway, I finally got to go and it was a total disappointment.  The opening and closing numbers were quite impressive, and what I expected (the stage was full, large costumes, etc.) but the middle parts were strange story lines that didn't make sense, a ton of men singing and dancing (I wanted to see showGIRLS!)  and the worst part was the choreography: the timing was way off and everyone looked like they had a different style of doing everything.  I was expecting to be amazed at the precision but was totally let down.I will say that the interludes they had between the numbers was quite good.  There was a pair of men doing acro stuff, a man on silks and a gentleman who twirled these giants shapes in the air, and when the light caught the metallic of the shapes, it created a sort of psychedelic color thing.  We were more entertained by the interludes than anything else.The set piece for the Titanic was cool, though.  All in all, if we hadn't spent so much money on the tickets, I would have left early so I could get to Pure nightclub to see New Kids on the Block.
