HORRIBLE service!  I understand if a business is busy, but you still try to offer some type of customer service.  We walk in and one associate yells out "we'll be with you in a minute". After waiting 15 minutes...killing time looking at phones and for someone to ask us again if we needed assistance still NOTHING!  Two other customers walked in after us and no one bothered to yell out to them or even walk by. Yes, most of them were helping customers.  Some even doubled up having two associates helping customers.  I just feel it's poor service if no one can even take 30 seconds to ask the reason you came in.  This was the second time at this location and I will NEVER go back to this location again.
