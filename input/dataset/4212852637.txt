If you are reading this post prior to finalizing your car rental here then turn the other way and run fast. This place is a scam The price you see on your travel sites won't be the final price you pay at the counter. Thinking of insuring the rental vehicle through your credit card or personal insurance? Forget it. They will come up with lame bull**** reason and say your card/insurance doesn't qualify. They go on to FORCING you to purchase their insurance at absurd rates. I highly suggest sticking with Enterprise or Hertz. Beware.
