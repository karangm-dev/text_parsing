So I waited to eat there a few times before I write a review. Not everything has been on point but what stands out above everything else is management listens to feedback and has already made adjustments. My wife is the vegetarian going on vegan and I am the meat eater in the family, and we both have been satisfied in the choices. We were told of future changes and am looking forward to being part of the "experment".
