For my first experience with See Spot Shop at Ancala Village I've gotta go 5star! The staff was so helpful in my first visit to inquire about grooming. I scheduled an appt for a couple days later and had a great experience with Sheri the groomer. She was ready and waiting for me and my little princess (a 12 year old Pom) - 45 min later she was done which means no kennel time for my girl which I totally appreciate! The haircut was perfect and Lilly seemed very content. Reasonable grooming prices too! Will def be going back!
