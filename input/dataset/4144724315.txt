A disgrace to Chicago pizza establishments! Went there on a Sunday, was severely understaffed. We waited nearly 30 min. for appetizers, and an hour for pizza.  Pizza dough was undercooked, and sauce was horrible.  Wings were okay.  We were handed our menus from some random guy sitting at the bar drinking a beer.  Also, we saw at least 5 people come directly in from the street, not wash their hands, and float in and out from behind the bar.  They were all wearing street clothes. One guy sitting at the bar, literally, leaned over the bar from his seat and poured himself a fountain drink.  All of these people either work there, and were off duty, or are regulars, as the bartenders seem to know them. Speaking of the fountain drinks, the hoses and spouts taste like they hadn't been cleaned in weeks! O, and one of the bartenders (wearing Dallas Cowboy attire) incessantly drank soda behind the bar, and btw, he was one of the people that never washed his hands.  Somebody needs to call John Taffer from Bar Rescue immediately. Stay away! Go to the Rosati's on Miller Road in Scottsdale.  They seem to have it figured out.  This place needs better management and oversite.  Don't allow this place to continue disgracing the good name of Chicago pizza.
