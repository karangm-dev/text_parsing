I travel all over for my job, so I have tried it all, this was horrible.  The salsa has no flavor and the chips taste like oil.  I ordered the burrito rojo, the meat was cold, dry, and flavorless and the tortilla was even cold.  The beans seem to be out of a can and the rice had no flavor.  I will definitely not be returning.
