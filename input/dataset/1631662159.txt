Petco can beat PetSmart and Pet Supplies Plus any day of the week. Today in particular was an excellent experience. The store had all three types of cat food I buy in stock in cases, which is so helpful. But the best part is the young man, Demont, who was my cashier. He was just bubbling with personality and humor. He said he's tired of going places and finding the employees mad all the time and wanted to be the opposite. I told him he had made my day. I hope his manager reads this and teaches him how to train other employees. He was just a complete delight!
