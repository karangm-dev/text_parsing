Excellent Hotel and casino, my wife and I loved our time there. We really felt safe with the Security doing random vehicle checks and the Suite elevator Security making sure only guests can go to the Suites.Everyone was so nice to answer our questions on how to get to the few dinning spots we had reservations fro during our stay.We felt very safe , knowing what happened last year (Oct. 1 2017). Thank you for making us feel like VIPs and safe.
