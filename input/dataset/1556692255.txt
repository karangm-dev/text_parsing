I'm only familiar with the services department. 7:30 am appointment, arrived at 7:00 am, just got a call at 12:00 that the "service team wasn't able to get the car done by noon", so a call at 2:00 or 2:30 for an update. I guess I'm not sure why it takes 7 hours for an OIL CHANGE. I don't think I'll be coming back when I get my car back sometime today.
