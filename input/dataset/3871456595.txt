Bulldogis gourmet hotdogs I love hot dogs consider it a special treat to have a good hot dog... I've driven past Buldogis lots of times and decided to check it out yesterday They advertise a ' Chicago' dog which is my fave.. I'm from Chicago and know a good Chicago dog from an imposter.... The version they serve here is definitely an imposter... Not even a good oneWhen I looked at their menu board I asked if their Chicago dog was served on a poppy seed bun.. No.      Then I asked if they used Vienna Hot Dogs... No.   They mentioned a brand I'd never heard of.  For starters, if you're not serving Vienna brand hot dogs and not using poppy seed buns then you shouldn't call them Chicago Dogs... EVERSo I figured I'd order one of their other specialties... The West Coast Dog sounded good... Cheddar cheese, carmelized onions, and avocado mayoWhat could be bad??Apparently everythingThe place was almost empty, there was no line... But I waited what seemed like forever.... My hot dog arrived in a tiny cardboard serving thingie ... Smothered in condiments and sauceThe bun was coldThe hot dog was barely warmThe bun fell apart when I picked it upOnions tomatoes may cheese everywhere Including the table because the container was so small.... And no fork to scoop stuff up.... And NO FRIES!!! The damn hot dog was $6.95 I've never been in any hot dog place anywhere that charged almost seven dollars and had the chutzpah not to include friesBiggest rip-off in town!!!A waste of money
