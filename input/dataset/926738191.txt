Very very poor customer service at the front desk when we checked in. Then my family and I overheard the girls talking about us after we left. If it wasn't New Years in Las Vegas we would have moved hotels. And we are gold members, we have been going to these hotels for many years. Hopefully these girls will get updated training.
