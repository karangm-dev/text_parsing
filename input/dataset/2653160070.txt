I ordered Mediterranean salad and it was spicy with organic greens and hint of raspberry. So yummy!  The loose leaf tea was great and comes in a little glass pot, very nice. The price is right, no doubt. Service was quick and efficient, even though the place looked busy. There some comfy chairs around if you stay for a while and Buffalo exchange near by. Overall awesome place and it exceeded my expectations :). Thanks guys!
