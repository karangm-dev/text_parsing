Lana is amazing. Two weeks before my wedding, I realized I still wasn't happy with how my dress fit. The other alterations place I had been to wasn't able to help me on such short notice, and they recommended Lana. She got me in right away and made my dress fit beautifully in a week! The price was also very reasonable. I highly recommend her.
