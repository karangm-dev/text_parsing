Well the grand opening of the Bruno Mars performance at the Chelsea wasn't so grand. Bruno Mars was excellent though the concert started 1 hour late.  The problem is the venue and the logistics associated with it.  The ticket stated the concert started at 9 pm but come to find out upon arrival that was when the door opened.  A very long line developed and with a late starting concert as well, most everyone waited 2-3 hours for an 1 1/4 hr show.  In addition, they really pack people in on the floor....and this floor really moves and feels unsafe. This venue is on the third floor.  I am surprised we didn't end up on the ground floor.  Compared to other smaller venues in Vegas...this one ranks low.  I am not looking forward to going back unless management learns how to throw events.
