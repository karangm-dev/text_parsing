If you are looking for Chinese acrobats as in other Cirque du Solei shows, don't go to this show.  But if you love the Fab 4 and a great visual show interpreting a variety of their songs- you have to see this show.  Although our seats were good there didn't seem to be a bad seat in the house.   The costumes were amazing - a visual masterpiece and the sound was INSANE (just like the ticket prices!) I especially love how they took sound bites of the Beatles talking and incorporated it into the show.  Oh how I wish I could have been brought up when music was really meaningful...(sigh).
