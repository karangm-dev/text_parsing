I used to frequent this location about a month.  Over the past 6 months the service has really gone down hill.  I had a really bad experience about 6 months ago with food taking way too long (20 minutes to appetizer, additional 30 minutes to food, and food was cold) and a manager who didn't care.  I took a couple of months off.  Tried again, still bad and slow service.  Took a couple more months off and gave it one final try.  Still really slow service and the food was mediocre.  I had to ask for Ice in my ice-tea.  I didn't want warm tea, I ordered ice tea.  My appetizer chips weren't warm and were a bit stale.  Ironically they now have these kiosks on the table where you can place orders and pay your bill.  I didn't want to use it to pay my bill but the server went MIA and was forced to use it.  Fortunately it had an instant feedback screen where I expressed my displeasure.  I won't be returning.
