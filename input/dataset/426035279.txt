A group of us checked in and had had an amazing experience... until we arrived at the THE hotel.  Steve at the front desk was full of attitude when we checked in, and wasn't willing to honor the rewards that we were told we could have honored. He was not apologetic or polite, and unbending in his feeling that he was right- not exactly customer service oriented. He didn't exactly reaffirm that we were at THE hotel. I kind of felt like we were at DON'T hotel.  The rooms are pretty and they let us check in early. Steve needs improvement.
