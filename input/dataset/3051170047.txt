I am giving this practice two stars because the front desk staff and nurses have been kind, but every other experience has been awful. The doctors that I have encountered have been uncaring, rude and unprofessional. They don't listen and don't seem to be interested in helping the patient. My most recent doctor came in complaining about his work load and proceeded to totally dismiss my thoughts and concerns about my health. The people in the lab were nice, but after getting blood work done, they contacted me to say they lost a vial of my blood so I needed to come back. I will never be returning to this practice.
