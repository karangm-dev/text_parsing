Ate here for lunch during restaurant week. Portion sizes were perfect (not too big, not too small) and very delicious. A lot of their food is gf and/or vegetarian which is nice. They have a nice outside patio that we are able to eat on, and the service was fast. Definitely try the Mandelbrot blueberry sundae!
