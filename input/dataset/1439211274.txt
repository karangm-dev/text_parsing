We were recommended to this clinic. The veterinarian was very nice and spent extra time going into detail to answer our questions. Other than that I was not very impressed. It seemed expensive. Both of our dogs got Giardia. We were not given many instructions on what we needed to do to help prevent them from getting reinfected. We were given a prescription medication and went through two rounds. They were still infect and we were given a different medication for the third round. This is where it got very upsetting. Towards the end of this round, my beagle began showing neurological symptoms (stumbling, ataxic gait) along with refusing to eat and fatigue. It was very frightening. I then did some research on the new medication and discovered these were possible side effects which we were never told. We were also never told that this drug was not FDA approved and should be a last resort for dogs as there are is not much research to support its use. We ended up taking our beagle to the emergency vet who in the end also concluded it was probably the medications side effects. She had never used or heard of the medication either. If nothing else, we feel the clinic should have told us about the risks of this medication and the fact that it is not an approved drug for dogs with this condition. We will definitely be doing research on any medications recommended by future vets.
