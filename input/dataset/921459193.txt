Stay away!!! It took 7 tries to get a very simple order at the drive thru, and they STILL managed to mess it up. The cashier at the window copped an attitude when I tried to check to see if I got what I ordered, she told me to pull forward. I asked to speak to the manager, it turns out SHE TOOK MY ORDER! I asked for the number of the district manager, and for n=both of their names (they don't wear name tags...). I called the number she gave me, and this person told me I could come to another location to get the right food....which would entail at least 30 minutes round trip. And, he never even attempted to apologize for the horrible service. Don't even bother trying this place!!!!!
