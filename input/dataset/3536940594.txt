I initially came here for Invisalign treatments and a consultation on the price, etc. I had my wisdom teeth intact and they needed to come off before I could start the procedure. They recommended me to Dr. Daccache, who is great by the way. After that was completed and healed properly, I came back in to discuss my Invisalign treatment. Little did I know, I had some pretty bad cavities on my right top and bottom side(one almost turned into a root canal). And that's when I knew I had to switch to Bella Smiles. I was led to believe from my previous dental practitioners that I had no cavities and was good to go.  The staff at Bella Smiles are amazing at what they do, and I always feel welcomed whenever I walk in through the door. I definitely trust them with my teeth to tell you the least!
