First time here, I always drive by going to work and seeing the reviews made me want to try this place. Walked in, cute diner. Wasn't packed or anything but wasn't slow either. Hostess was very nice and welcoming... my waitress was really nice, she was so sweet. I got the bacon, egg and cheese croissant w/ a side of hashbrowns. Coffee was really good I got hazelnut flavor. Food was delicious:) prices are decent but they give you a good size portion. I definitely recommend this place if you haven't tried it :)
