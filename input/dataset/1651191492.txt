I am really disappointed about the service here. I called to book an appointment for Friday at 3:30 pm after seeing all the great reviews on yelp. The man on the phone said there was a spot available at 3:30 and that I could come in. I arrived at the salon around 3:00. The salon is really cramped, chaotic and looks cluttered. The woman at the desk was rude, was yelling across the room and had a harsh tone saying that my appointment was at 2:30 not at 3:30. I told her there most have been a mistake, because I called and the man said he put me in for 3:30. She snapped back saying there's no space. I left without receiving an apology.
