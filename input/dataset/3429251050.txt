What a fun club. Being a clubgoer who usually ends up not liking most of the clubs, I give this place 5 stars! It might be because we had a table upstairs in a reserved area where we got to dance by ourselves, enjoy the drinks and rest our feet a little. The layout is well done - so if you wanna mix into the crowd, there is a huge huge dance floor downstairs, and the music really rocks with lots of 80's (yeah I'm an 80's kid.) and less of R&B which gets sickening after you hear at any club you go. You can dance like a chicken here and nobody would care - so not a pretentious cheesy place at all. Crowd is good and not annoying. Overall - perfetto.
