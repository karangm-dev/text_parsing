Great place for a burger and love the steak fries! Good place to take kids or family and don't forget the awesome milk shakes!Only two stars as we were here Wednesday night and ordered the Kobe Bacon Cheddar Burger only to find out they were out of Cheddar Cheese! What how can you be a Burger joint and run out of Cheddar? Fuddruckers ORDER extra Cheddar next time!I will be back as things happen, just hope they have Cheddar when I go.
