Do you miss your smelly school cafeteria? Do you want a cafeteria that is for grownups but miss the smelly school cafeteria? Do you want the soggy or hard as hell overcooked cafeteria food from the smelly school cafeteria?DING! DING! DING! This is it! THE place you have been missing for so long! The smelly school cafeteria with soggy or hard as hell overcooked cafeteria food!I came here on Sunday night for the complimentary buffet.It's freaking Sunday night, so you might be expecting or thinking the food will not be too bad.....Oh hell no, the fish is overcooked, hard as hell. The pasta, spaghetti or whatever the thing on the pasta station is soggy and salty and more soggy.... Pizza is...... the same cafeteria pizza left for hours under heat lamp.Crab legs (both snow crab & "Alaska" crab) are salty and soggy. If you hit the crunchy part, it must be ice or the shell, watch out!Prime rib? Or prime bleeding rips off? If you like a full plate of bloody cafeteria food, this is it! Even the soft drink is self serve...Woohoo! So much to like for the grownups cafeteria... Except you are paying like a grownup too, a freaking whooping $40/person for Sunday night dinner... WTH to the inflation!!? Or the Price stuck in the early 2000s and the food got stuck in the 90s.....Either way you don't want to waste your money here. There are tons of food outside the strip with excellent value, try Chinatown, Hernderson, or the Valley.
