First off, super delicious burgers, but you'll wait for it.  You'll wait for drinks too, and you bill. Everything is good but the biggest thing keeping me away is the very slow service.I can't seem to get more then 2 drinks anytime I go. My pint glass will sit empty forever! It's a combination of lack of staff and the staff being frustrated by it, that translated into the long wait.
