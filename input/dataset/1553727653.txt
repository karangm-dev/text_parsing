We wound up here last Sunday around 1ish for a default brunch when we found our first choice closed.  I had the eggs florentine--eggs overcooked on a bed of elderly (yellowish flowers) rapini--and sampled the fritada which was a little dry.  The service was o.k. but not great.  We had one coffee refill offer which came within minutes of the coffee after which the pot disappeared, and we had to ask twice to get a bit  of salt.  After this, a concensus emerged that coffee and desert there was not in the cards.  In short, it wasn't terrible but it just wasn't good.
