Woke up earlier this week with a crazy case of Torticollis. Couldn't turn my head to the right and I was having spasms like crazy! Went to The Joint on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday (today). Quick, easy adjustments and I'm back to *almost* 100%.Today, I mentioned offhand that I've had TMJ for 3 weeks. Two seconds of adjustments and BAM it's fixed! What the heck?! Why didn't I ask about this before?!I signed up for the monthly program and I'll for sure be taking full advantage of it.
