The best there is! We interviewed several pool companies and talked to countless friends and coworkers about their pool building experiences. We couldn't find one person who loved their pool builder. We are happy to say we picked a winner! We found Thunderbird by searching the internet, we could not find a bad review and loved their website photos. We scheduled an appt with Les, their designer. Les is wonderful.  He is the total opposite of your traditional pool salesman. He took his time in listening to our needs and wants. We had a challenge because we live on a large parcel of land and wanted the pool to be a focal point. He drew a gorgeous design and continued to work with us until we loved both the plan and budget. Once we gave them the go it was so smooth I'm still in awe! Cynthia called every few days to tell me the schedule, when and whom would be in our yard. Every single person was on time and got their job done as scheduled. Our friends and family could not believe the speed and quality of our pool. We've been finished about 5 weeks and absolutely love our pool! If your searching for an incredible pool and spa builder please do yourself a favor and call Thunderbird. We will continue to  share our recommendation to anyone else looking to build a pool.
