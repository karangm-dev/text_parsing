I just went there last week and I have no complaints. I made the appointment online and it was super easy to schedule. The place is a little hard to find but eventually you can find it. It's in one building filled with multiple salons. BUT Kelly did my hair and she was extremely nice and chatty. I told her what i wanted and she made it happen. They also didn't nickel and dime me or add on any surprise prices.Will be going back!
