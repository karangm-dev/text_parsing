Was sold a "new" battery for $95. I was told I had a three year warranty; 5 year limited warranty, because of buying new. I paid for the battery and was given only my credit card receipt. I asked about a warranty form and he said the sticker on my battery and information in the computer was all I needed.  After about three months, it started dying frequently. About six times in the span of 2 1/2 months. I took it to my mechanic and he said it was all juiced out. I also took it through valvoline, for a second opinion, same response. So I went to bulldog battery to fix the problem. I told my situation to the guy at the desk, he had me take my car into the garage. The guy in the garage said it was a used battery. They offered to sell me a new battery. No warranty, because the battery was used. Really crappy even for used. So instead of saving me 30 bucks, bulldog battery cost me $95, and a headache. I give zero stars 0!
