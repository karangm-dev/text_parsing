Not a lot of selection and the guy here told me they make their chocolates on location. We didn't believe him and I still don't. It just doesn't mesh with the decor and general abience of the place. I think he could make money there just by operating a coffee shop and forget about this chocolate business. There's not enough selection anyway. Everybody in there was just sipping coffee and reading.Some of the baked desserts looked alright, which would fit in with more of a coffee house theme. But the chocolates are not worth going for....
