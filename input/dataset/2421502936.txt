I didn't catch the guys name who was working, but every time we come in he's always so helpful! We have gotten a few things from this location. They also carry cartons of cigarettes too. He took his time with helping find what we wanted and he was sooooo patient with us too. We didn't feel rushed at all. We will def continue to come back
