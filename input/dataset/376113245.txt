I was convinced to go here by some girlfriends.Holy gawd, it was the lamest show ever.For the $50 ticket admission price, I'd rather get a lap dance at the Spearmint Rhino.Bad choreography, desperate screaming women, cheesy Firemen costumes and short Steroided Australian men bored me to tears.But then again, you might like it . Not my type.Where's my drink?
