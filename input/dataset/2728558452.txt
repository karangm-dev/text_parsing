Completely disappointed with the service team at Percision fleet services and Tim. We bought our truck about a month ago from them, we test drove it and everything was perfect after they washed and filled it with gas the door sensor was not working. We live in Tucson so getting it fixed it's kind of an ordeal for us my husband drove up to Phoenix and spent all day in Phoenix waiting for them to fix it it took all day and the problem was still not solved. This is my husband's work truck so if he has no truck he has no way of making an income and they wanted to monopolize it for more time up in Phoenix. We Took it to a Ford dealership in  Tucson to fix it, Tim said that he would foot the bill and texted us that he would take care of it after it was fixed he took back  his offer and  refused to pay. He was very rude and inconsiderate to me on the phone. I've never been addressed so horrifically before and I will never do service with these people again. It is a complete shame to be so disrespected when my husband served his country for 10 years in the Navy and was treated so very poorly as a person and a vet. If you're choosing to do business with these people I want you to keep in mind that they have no respect for people their wives for veterans of this country all they care about is their bottom line I get it their car dealership but at the end  of the day were still people with children and we're just trying to make ends meet and they don't care about that at all. If I could put a negative score I would!
