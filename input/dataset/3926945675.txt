First and LAST visit. With just one person ahead of me, my visit to pick up our order took FIFTEEN MINUTES. The employee was painfully slow and scattered. To add insult to injury, once they finally located my items, they said I owed more $$ because they miscounted, and THEN I had to ask more than once to see a receipt as proof. Seriously? I don't think it's unreasonable to ask to see it in writing. They just wanted me to take their word for it. Meanwhile, the line is backing up out the door. On top of all this ridiculousness, I'm pouring sweat because the place has no air conditioning and it's freaking August with 104 temps! The owners should be absolutely ashamed of themselves expecting workers to slave away in a hot and humid shop like this! The fans only blow the hot air around and make both the employees and the customers cranky and hot! So on reflection, while I didn't exactly get the best service, I'm not sure I could do my best in these working conditions either! Arizona may be an at will state, and employers can certainly do what they want, but I won't give any more business to these jerks. Hopefully their employees find better jobs with people who actually care about them.
