My experience with Melissa was nothing short of safe, educational and reassuring. My "buzzing" in my ears was thoroughly tested, the results shared and thoughtfully explained with fear or sales pitch. DO yourself a favor and go see Melissa or take your family with hearing needs, knowing her amazing decades (she's young!) of knowledge and experience will provide you with the answers you are looking for. It's a rare treat to meet such a nice, accomplished professional. TY Melissa@miracle-ear
