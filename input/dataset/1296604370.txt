Don't think I'll go here again.  You have to push a broken intercom button to get service.  They tell you it will take a few days, but then never call you when to pick up the ashes.  The people were friendly, but service sucks.  I bought the middle grade package where they take a print of the dogs four feet, it was so rushed that its just one big blob (the dog was dead so it wasn't trying to pull its foot away).  It wouldn't even take an extra minute to have had a decent print made, I did pay extra for it.
