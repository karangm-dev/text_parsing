Worse experience ever! Got in there, no one came out to the counter. Waited there for about five minutes, I tried to call the store to get their attention and still no one came out. When I finally could order, I received the wrong item but just kept it moving. They gave me no lids for my ice cream(3) to go. I would rather make the drive to cold stone next time.
