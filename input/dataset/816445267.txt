I booked a room for my parents here. The room was double booked, my parents were forced to move rooms their second night, without notice. I did not get a phone call, nor did the hotel attempt to contact me to let me know that the room was given to someone else. No one was in the room when the other residents entered the room, and my parents luggage and personal items were still in the room for several hours before we found out. Overall, this experience showed me that the management staff did not care about the situation, and did not offer a resolution. After numerous phone calls asking to speak to the hotel manager (remember, no one called me), I ended up going to the front desk the following morning. Patrick W (a manager) knew nothing of the situation, demonstrating a lack of communication. Also, when I questioned WHY my parents had to give up their room when other rooms were available, Patrick mentioned it was a computer glitch. Granted, I understand this can happen, but I did not understand why no one communicated it to me.When I expressed my discontent, Patrick's response was: "what do you want me to do about it?". Lack of professionalism. I do not need to tell a manager how to resolve an issue. I was promised my stay would be refunded (it's been over 24 hours... nothing has been done). No one followed up with me to see if my concerns were addressed, nor was there any effort to gain my business.
