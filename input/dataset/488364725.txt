Going to the Dundas location and ordering the full cheesecake is much more worth it than coming here. Ordering a slice of cake here is on the pricier side- $7-8 per slice when you can get a whole cake for just a little more money. When I came here I ordered the original matcha cheesecake, which was good but I prefer the unflavored original one. I think it's more worth it to get the tasting platter for $20 something and sharing with friends instead of everyone getting their own slice. The maid cafe style was cute but I imagined the service would be better than it was. If you've ever been to one in Japan, this one definitely cannot compare.
