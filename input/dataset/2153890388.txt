Well since prices don't really come in to play in Ontario (Government regulated) the way one sells there are few factors one can use to set themself apart i.e. location, variety and service.The location though accessible for this area has its own share of issues. The place also had a couple of people looking for trouble and I commend the sales person for dealing with the situation calmly (I guess they are used it) this did make me feel out of place and I wanted to bolt out of there.The selection is somewhat decent and they carry some of the Unibrue stuff I desire (maudite and Chambley)Service is quick but the location and setup makes me not recommend it. Go here only if you need to.
