It's was a great place previously but now down to earth. From menu delete best lots, and today I'm coming before close 40 minuts. I'm driven 20 min, because yelp show this place close at 11 pm. Finally shef say me - not today and go out, don't ask maybe I'm wanna stay in bar and drink. Doesn't have time to another restaurant, because loose time for him. Bad service
