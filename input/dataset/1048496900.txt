It's cheap.Can I really give this place a one star review because people don't know how to park at a pump or pump gas quickly? Honestly, no matter which gas station you go to you are going to have those problems. This gas station is easy to get to, organized, and clean-- so 5 stars!If it makes anyone feel better, I used to get Costco gas back home in LA and would wait in a line five cars deep to get gas. I go to this Sam's and I only had one car in front of me. Did I mention it's cheap?
