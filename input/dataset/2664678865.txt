I was really, REALLY disappointed in the staff. I had gone THREE times to find a dog and the first two times the dogs I was interested in were adopted which was fine. So Wednesday I called and I asked about one of the dogs and the lady on the phone told it wouldn't be ready till Friday. I rearranged all my plans for Friday morning. They don't open till 11AM, I get there at 9:30AM. I was the first in line and waited for an hour and a half. I was the first person to walk in the door and ask about the dog and she said well we have to wait to see if anyone else would like to see the dog and so of course there was someone else. Mind you- this person shows up 20 minutes before they opened and I waited an hour and a half... and what happens? They do a raffle and she ends up getting the dog. They claim they are first come, first serve which is NOT true at all... False advertising and they really need to stick to what they say. I will not be returning and I will make sure that I let others know what horrible service I experienced while I was there. Truly unfair and not right.
