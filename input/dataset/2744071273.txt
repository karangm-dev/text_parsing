Such a breath of fresh air for the Indian cuisine scene. This Indian-street food style restaurant is exactly what the public needs to break from the standard "banquet-style" food you get at most Indian restaurants. People need to know that Indian food is more than just chicken tikka masala. I hope the menu continues to expand while still focusing on the chaat and other street food items. I hope they add things like pav bhaji, vada pav, paneer sandwiches, and possibly some Indo-Chinese items. This will make this restaurant truly unique in what it offers the greater Madison community.
