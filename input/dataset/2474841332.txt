okay, tonite i was in the mood for a quick burger so we decided to check out this farmer boys location a little closer to the house.  from the time we walked into the restaurant i could tell i was not in a 'typical' fast food joint... it is so clean and inviting! it reminds me of a down-home diner.  some quick notes:- customer service was outstanding- food tasted delicious- was served to us hot and with nice presentation- pastrami sandwich is ON POINT!thank you farmer boys! we will def be back!!ooh, and just as an added bonus; the ladies room is super clean and smelled like bath n body works!! ha
