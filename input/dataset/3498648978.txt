Unbelievably and wonderfully magical experience!!  My husband and I sat up in the front and had a wonderful "trip" on the magical mystery tour of the Beatles.  It was so fun to watch and sing along to.  Colorful and you use all your senses when watching, touching and listening to this show.  I want to go again with my teenagers!! My mom would have loved this, she was a beatle maniac!
