This used to be one of my favorite places, unfortunately, that's no longer the case. I hadn't been in several months but I was going to have some people over so I wanted to put together a really good cheese board. Before, I would always just head over to the cheese display and have one of the staff members help me pick cheeses that would go well with what I was serving. However, I can't do that anymore because the cheese display is no longer there!!! It is now pre-cut and they have it in the furthest fridge from the register, by the wines. Additionally, I wasn't able to buy bread anymore! My disappointment cannot be put into words. The name "French Grocery" is false advertisement now. It may be "French", but there's nothing "Grocery" about it anymore.
