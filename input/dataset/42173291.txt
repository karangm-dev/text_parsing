Oh my god are you kidding me??!!!!! I had the most rude lady today drawing my blood. The first thing she said to me is "whats your problem?" I told her I was just nervous and I hate getting blood taken. She told me to deal with it because nobody likes it. What the hell??!!! THEN she gets me in the room and said "you are drama and I don't need drama in here" I should of just left then but I was too nervous and wasn't even thinking. She needs to get fired ASAP!! She bruised me pretty bad! Ugh
