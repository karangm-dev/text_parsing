The food here is amazing - one of the best Thai food in the city in my opinion.  It may even give Pai a run for its money.  We ordered the masaman beef and the garlic pepper beef.  Both dishes were delicious, flavourful  and tasted very authentic, with a bit of a "street style" modern flair.  We will definitely be back here again and again.  Our favourite new restaurant in the Village!
