This is my favorite coffee shop in Madison. The coffee is stellar and the baristas are friendly. The shop itself is cozy and inviting with mismatched chairs and tables, and I love the art they hang on the walls. They sell some local artisan products, such as hand sewn aprons and things, which is yet another reason to love JPH. Great quality of food and drinks, you really can't go wrong with anything they've got. I also love their story slams! So much fun! JPH, you're the best!
