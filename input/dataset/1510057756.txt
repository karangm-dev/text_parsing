Ambiance is great, margaritas are refreshing but there is no way there was a full shot of tequila in it. I ordered a $4 shrimp taco and it was literally "a shrimp" taco with Toni shrimp that I ate in one bit, the rest was all cabbage and I don't have a big bite. We also ordered the hot dog and it came with 6 French fries... 6. The service was slow, we were sitting for 30 minutes before the server came back to take our food order after dropping g off the sub par drinks. Won't be my next first or second choice next time I want tacos or margaritas. Oh and to top it off they charge for salsa, not particularly good salsa, just plain blended tomato salsa. We don't mind paying but we want quality if we do.
