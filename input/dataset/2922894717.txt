In town for a few days from Los Angeles and had to hit a record store or two if possible...Glad I made it to the "In" Groove while I'm in town! The owner takes care of his stock, when I walked in he had 6 record cleaners going simultaneously...most stores these days don't bother and it's a shame. I dug as much as I could for a little over an hour and left with some real goodies plus a smile on my face. Glad to see places like this hanging on and run lovingly.Thank you!
