I ordered large ice cream in a cup for $6.35 u want decent amount of ice cream... I told the lady at the cash register she said this is it ...the cups are large .... what a waste of money will never step foot in this store again ... notice they didn't even get high ratings in this location... customer service is zero!!!!
