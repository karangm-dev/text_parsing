I had written my previous review of Goodyear after a frustrating experience. Within 12 hours of posting the review, I was contacted by Shane, the District Manager of Goodyear in hopes of resolving the issue. This is the quickest response from management I've ever received after a discrepancy. I am blown away by how apologetic and accomadating Shane was. Prior to contacting me, he had pulled up my invoice and admitted that there was certainly a mistake that was made. He offered me a refund of the overcharged $100 and an explanation. This was simply a misunderstanding with a new staff member who was not informed of the promotions in place. From what I understand after the explanation from Shane, Goodyear does offer the ceramic pads at the promotion price. I don't exactly understand what the original sales employee had tried explaining to me at the time of payment about the different brake pads that are used, but Shane assured me that Goodyear stocks quality centric pads. This review update is simply on the urgency that was taken by upper management to resolve customer issues regardless of how large or small they might be. Goodyear is lucky to have an employee like Shane overlooking their locations.
