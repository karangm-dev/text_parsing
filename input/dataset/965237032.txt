Rented a jeep to go to Utah for a family trip. Luckyvme we mostly got rained out and of course the outside 2as dirty not muddy but dirty. To my surprise when i brought it back i was told by the manager Julio that i needed to get it cleaned? Again i mention it was dirty not muddy. I cant believe that im responsible to have the car cleaned. I was told that a simple car wash wouldn't get the dirt off? So i took it to 7-11 across the street ran it through the wash and everything came off? The manager Julio was not helpful and just acted like a teenager which he basically is. Thanks Hertz way to treat your local gold members!
