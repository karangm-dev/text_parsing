The food is fine, but they have a serious problem with service if you show up after 2 p.m. when your waiter is likely to forget about you so he can eat his own lunch and chew the fat with the other staff. My husband had to go get us a box for leftovers himself and we never got a check. We went up to pay and when waiter was summoned, he acted confused about where our check was. Also, he never checked on us to refill our water. Maybe it was his first day....
