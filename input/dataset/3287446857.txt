Stay far away from here. ALL of the employees here are RUDE! So when I first walk into the store I grab a cart. The all mighty door greater/return sticker lady immediately yells at me. "You can't plug your phone in there! That's stealing electricity!" I'm so confused. "What?" She yells at me again to take my phone out of the wall. "Umm... that's not mine." WTF?  I blow it off. That lady must be having a bad day. Later, I decided to take a look around the makeup section. I didn't get anything since you have to pay there at the little register in the makeup section and I thought it was very inconvenient for customers to have to wait in not one, but two slow ass lines. As i'm leaving the makeup section a lady stops me, looking through the items in my cart, and tells me I have to pay for them there. "Excuse me, but non of these items are from this section, so no I don't!" I ended up leaving without purchasing anything and went to target instead. Wow! what a difference!
