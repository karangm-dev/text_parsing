So glad to be a part of Nikki's 1st Burstday Party! We had a great time and thanks setting it all up.The location was great and I probably wouldnt have ventured out to this Pinkys, since we live in Uptown and right beside the other Pinkys, if it wasnt for this event. Thanks Sierra Nevada and Sailor Jerrys for the delish drinks. The Sailor Jerry Mai Thai drink was definitely a winner!The staff at Pinky's was excellent and the food was definitely flowing. The White Trash burgers were definitely a highlight! Also, Im proud to say that I have now had tofu! The fired artichokes, fried pickles, dips, veggies....yum! The only thing I didnt try was the stuffed jalapeno, only cause I was stuffed myself! Once again, thanks for a fun event with great food, drinks, and people!
