This was a brilliant experience. If you are in Vegas then do this..you will not regret it. Please do not be put off by the outside exterior as it looks like you are visiting an office rather than a restaurant. The staff are fabulous and really look after you. It is very very dark. Your eyes do not adjust at all. The food is fabulous and our waitress (victoria) acted as the best guide for the evening. We dined as a party of four and had the best night ever! If you do one thing off the strip...do this!Thank you for a fabulous and memorable experience.
