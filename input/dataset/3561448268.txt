Definitely won't go back here. Went to buy juice earlier tonight. They asked what nicotine level I normally use, and one of the employees was incredibly condescending when I said between 6 and 12 mg. It's not his concern what my preference is nor his place to pass judgment, and if that's how they treat customers they won't be receiving any more of my money.
