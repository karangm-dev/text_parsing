Went the day before and asked if my wife could eat there with her peanut and tree nut allergy and they said she could.  Went back the next day and they basically said there wasn't anything she could eat that would be 100% safe.  That was our cue not to try anything but my wife insisted I try something as this was going to be one of the highlights of the trip.  So disgruntled I tried the General wings.  They were more sweet than spicy.  Had the look of sweet and sour sauce.  The majority of general tso sauce I've had is more brown in color.  It was OK but wouldn't go out of my way for them.  They had a sandwich I wanted to try but with the allergy situation I was really disappointed my wife couldn't join me in a meal.  Come on Guy you are in Vegas you should know how to deal with allergies.  Triple D= disappointment! disgruntled and down right lacking in flavor town.
