Maybe it's just this location, but I did not see ONE DROP of tomato sauce on ANY of the pizzas in this restaurant, so I walked out and will not come back. Yes, they make "white pies" in New York, but only as a special order. In New York City where I'm from, the sauce is probably the MOST important ingredient and constitutes as much of the pizza as the cheese or the crust. So all this phoney baloney about this pie being like NYC or the East Coast is BULL!
