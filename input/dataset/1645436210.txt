Hustlers from the minute you walk in. Upselling the whole time. Won't even let you enjoy. Went 3 times to try different people, same thing. In fact they got worse. My nails not only chip and break but they're shaped exactly how I said I didn't and they dug so deep in my cuticles and under the nail they burned if they touched any other fluid except water FOR A WEEK. their fast and will do your mani and pedi at the same time but prepare to be hassled the whole time to buy extra and prepare for physical regret lasting a week. Don't let IVY near you.
