Came in for lunch around 1 and the place was pretty dead. Very nice atmosphere and comfortable seating, open dining area but also private dinning areas for large groups. Our orders were taken quickly. We asked for garlic bread as an appetizer. After 15 minutes went by, we asked our server about the bread, she snapped back "it's cooking" and walked off. Two minutes later she brings us a basket of room temp bread slices slathered with cold garlic butter. Not very appealing. Service was very slow considering there was only one other group of people dining. The chicken caeser salad was decent. Dressing was a little mayonnaisey. Overall, it was a typical caeser salad, nothing special. Best part was their homemade croutons. The Milano pizza was incredibly dull. With as many toppings as it had, I was pretty surprised by the lack of flavor. For $14, there are WAY better pizza options out there. The "Panini" was disappointing. It was more like meatballs between dried out thin pita bread. Best part of our meal was their Kentucky Mule cocktail. $9. VERY DELICIOUS. Overall, there are a hundred better options for food in this price range and in this area.
