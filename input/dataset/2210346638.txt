I wasn't impressed at all. I was really excited to go, but the music was sooo loud and the dancers just weren't that great. I had a headache from the noise by the time I left and my head was ringing when I went to bed. The guys either looked high, bored, or tired, and the choreography needed way more rehearsal. Went on a Thursday. Not worth the money.
