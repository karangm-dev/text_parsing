I LOVE Trader Joe's! Their products are healthy, delicious and expand my taste buds beyond the mass-produced mini pizza's and pre-made dinners of the regular grocery store. Many of my friends complain that the prices are too high, but I don't think so. If you buy the right products you'll be full on about the same price as the grocery store because you'll be getting full on less food. Plus, it's just plain healthier. I highly recommend the pre-made salads for lunches and their electrolyte enhanced water gives me an extra boost of energy throughout the day. I'm not a fan of store-bought sushi, but their Lobster rolls and big platters are pretty delish for coming from a store. Trader Joe's is a plethora of Yumminess!
