Much like the previous reviewer, we didn't just feel rushed through dinner.  We actually were rushed.  We did not get appetizers as they likely would have arrived after dinner.  I couldn't help but think of Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares as regards the menu and food gathering, "It shouldn't be this bloody complicated or require so much explanation."Don't listen to the staff regarding spices.  We did and the food turned out bland.  They are very protective of the seafood and try various ways of limiting it.  The food was okay but not worth a return trip.  I have never gotten a check so fast ever.  The facility is way too small and too cramped and the layout was done very poorly.The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable but you could tell they are pressured to turn tables quickly.
