If I could give them more stars, I would.I LOVE Dr. Ed and Dr. Nicole.  They are THE BEST!Caring, generous, supportive, inspirational..... they are truly wonderful people.  I cannot say enough good things about them.Not only are they good people but they are great chiropractors.  I've been seeing a chiro since I was in high school due to a sports injury.  And I was distraught when I moved from Southern CA because I didn't know what I would do.... for a while I drove back to SoCA every 4-6 weeks for a routine adjustment with my chiro there.  And then I was referred to Dr. Ed... and I've been thrilled with the service for the past 3 years.I always leave feeling better physically and emotionally.  They have such a soothing office and way with people that you can't help to feel more relaxed when you leave.
