Don't try and have a conversation here. The music is deafening! My ears were almost bleeding. My group of friends have to consistently shout when we come here.Even by the beer pong tables its hard to talk!Next, the drinks are overly expensive and "meh." The drink special the other night was a "Washington Apple" shot for three dollars. The shots were weak and poured from a pre-mixed bottle. When I asked what other specials they had the bartender scowled at me.Lastly, many of the dances are quite different here. It's not revolvers fault but its strange when you've been dancing a song for years but now its the "revolver" way.Honestly, I have a much better time at Stoney's South. Better drink specials, you can have a conversation and I know the dances are "standard" fare.
