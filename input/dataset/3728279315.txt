Burger King is Burger King, the food is good, but the difference is service (or lack thereof).  When you go through the drive-through to get food for several, there's not really a practical way to open and check every item for accuracy.  So you drive away and you don't know it's screwed up until you get there.  Most fast food sends you with a receipt with a website you can visit to make a compliment or complaint, but we have no receipt.  So I go on BK's website to report the problem (like you can for EVERY fast food restaurant in the world), but my only option is to make a phone call to FLORIDA (toll call, no 800 number).  Seriously?Also, and this is important...  If you're at the drive-through and they tell you to "pull around to the front" because your order is taking a long time, DO NOT do it.  There is no "up front," there's just the exit and the street.  Most awkward, I blocked the entire world for the 10 minutes it took to get my food.The 2-stars are because the food that *was* right was pretty yummy.
