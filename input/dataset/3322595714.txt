I can't quite put my finger on it but I don't like Merchants. Maybe it's just, at this price point, I would rather go to Earl's where I know the quality of the ingredients can't be beat for the price.  Merchants has swept up the folks who used to hang out at Fergus & Bix before FB was kicked out of its Marda Loop location by a greedy landlord who thought he could replicate the success of FB himself in the form of the Mad Rose pub. I digress. Back to Merchants. Sorry, I just can't get excited about it.  It has the same menu as everywhere else, lesser quality waitstaff, an older, on the prowl clientele and tiny TVs for watching the game.  In short, I don't know you would go here given the alternatives.
