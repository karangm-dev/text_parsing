This place can make you a bit claustrophobic, especially if you've frequented the  LV North Premium Outlets. Here's how it sizes up:-Easier to park (but you might get stuck in some traffic due to lack of stop lights)-Indoors so you can find some sanctuary for those hot Vegas summers (but it feels kind of claustrophobic inside)-A lot of store selections (but I feel like the selection is much bigger at the North outlets)-More food options compared to North outlets, including surrounding food options-lacks that "touristy" vibe, so less tourists looking lost or toting their luggageDespite the hassles of the North outlets, I still feel like I'd rather shop there. Although it was nice being indoors, it was easier to get to the main stores we wanted to go to by walking outside the building, but our trip was ultimately a bust.
