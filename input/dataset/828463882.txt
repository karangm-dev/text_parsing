I adore and respect my physician, Dr. Koppenbrink. The problem does not rest with him, as he recently joined this group. When I leave the office, I always ask what my copay is. Both visits I was told there was none, as I have Medicare.  Then, the harassing robo calls begin, telling me I haven't paid my bill!  I have spoken to the office to no avail. The calls are more like I would think a collection agency would make, and it's frustrating, as there is no one with whom to speak. The phones are always busy if you wish to not talk at a machine.  The staff  is curt when I'm in office, except for my doctor's own assistant. This practice may cause me to seek a new doctor, which is very sad. The partners in this practice need to meet to discuss and resolve these issues, all of which are office staff related, as well as how they have decided to handle billing.
