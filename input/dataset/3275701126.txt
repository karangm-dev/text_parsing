Worst service EVER!! Had a appointment and everything, but still couldn't get decent customer service to say the least. Once I finally found someone to check me in (and yes I had to find someone to help despite patiently waiting in line only to be passed up by numerous workers who seemed to be too busy to even ask if I needed help) the guy I finally ended up with was only concerned that he had a 1 on 1 appointment waiting AFTER me who had a problem with his computer.  After briefly looking at my iPhone he passed me on to another guy whom he didn't even introduce me to, so I had no idea who he was until he came out from the back 15 minutes later. On a somewhat better note, once the guy came out from what seemed to be his break because he was still chomping on food, I was given a replacement phone and sent on my merry way. I have been to other Apple stores and have NEVER encountered service like this. Seeing as how it wasn't even that busy, which Apple stores usually are, I would NOT recommend going to this location. It obviously lacks a good manager that can not see that their employees are unwilling to help customers who spend $$$$ on their products.
