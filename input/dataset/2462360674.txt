This was my first time doing the hot pot thing and this place is awesome. Great service, really fresh food, good prices. The scallops are sushi grade, which is awesome because you can just barely cook them...yum. We were here for lunch and got so much high-quality, yummy food for $11 a person. Free refills on salad and veggies. Ask for extra peanut sauce, it is so good. I can't wait to come back here next time we are in Vegas.
