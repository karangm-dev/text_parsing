The breakfast burrito is ridiculous! Sooo delicious. It is probably the size of a newborn baby and so good. I can't wait to take my husband here. I'm not sure I could order anything else after I had the burrito. Yum! The woman who took my order was also super friendly and made me feel very welcomed.
