Wow, I had a couple of slices initially and was back a week later for a pizza. I ordered a large deluxe pizza, and like the slices, I was not disappointed. These guys do an awesome pizza and their prices are spot on. My kids, wife and myself really really love Marconi's pizza. Try it you won't be disappointed. I drive 25-minutes to pick up this pizza, well worth it.
