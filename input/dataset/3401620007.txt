We love Cheesecake Factory! We make it a point to stop in here for lunch anytime we are leaving Charlotte to go home to Columbia. Today we had a great experience! We started with Tuna Tartare, which was beautifully presented and very fresh. We loved it, and it was a nice diversion from some of their "not so healthy" appetizers. For lunch, I ordered my favorite Louisiana Chicken Pasta and the S.O. ordered teriyaki chicken. Both were excellent! Our server was awesome and we really had a great lunch with several drinks. We don't love corporate places, but this place is an exception to that rule!
