Oook...my husband and I have been here a few times and I would call it my new spot but last night I came across a baby roach crawling it's way around the salsa bar. Now, I understand and know that restaurants attract rodents bug isn't it the responsibility if the people who run these places make sure shit like that is taken care of?! I mean come on bro..."yea can I get a burrito with sour cream, hold the roaches" hell to the no. My husband will eat anything so I think he didn't mind rodent in his food and he said he thinks the roaches came from the kabob place next door lol! Either way, super gross. I don't know about anyone else but I will never return to eat here nor will I recommend it..
