very romantic, had the lamb for the entree wch was cooked  and served to perfection, and accentuated by the fresh mint it came with, my fave was the crab ravioli wch i got as an appetizer, (seafood is my nirvana). tonight my date chose the tenderloin wch i almost got (he chose medium well, yuch i think he just ruined his steak, oh well) replete with asparagus and a side of potatoes. we were both too full for desert after sharing everything.  if you're on the west side in summerlin and are able to make reservations, check out this establishment. it's fine dining (slightly less than strip prices, but worth it), great table service, and romantic from my vantage point! p.s. you can also eat outdoors under the night sky a REAL sky not forum shops fake sky, it's absolutely breathtaking and maaarvelous!!!
