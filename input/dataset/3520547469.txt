i've been here several times and felt that there was nothing special to write about. I prefer BR or Cha time, i've asked for little/ less sugar but it always end up being sweet.I decided to write a review because I ordered deep fried oysters and it was surprisingly one of the best ones that i've ever had! its crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Tip: remember to suck once you take a bite or else the juice spills everywhere since they don't provide plates!
