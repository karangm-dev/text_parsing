Do not go there. The worst service,  Administration and they don't have any doctors. They don't care if you are dying or not. However, the receptionist believe she is a diagnostician. She actually told me that I wasn't sick enough to go and see a doctor there and turned me away on a Saturday afternoon. Not even close to 5. Then they gave me a z-pack for something that I needed antibiotics . Not to put down nurses but apparently she missed this. When I called to try to get another prescription it was wait let me see if I could get that approved. I had already paid $159 for nothing. I've had pneumonia 7 times, trying to prevent the 8th and they don't care at all. Keep away from this place you are sure to die
