First time for lash extensions. Place was clean, staff was friendly and spoke good English. Bought the groupon eyelash extension. Did NOT receive what I have asked for. Asked for natural lashes but opened my eyes to lashes that were ready to go to the club. My friends have told me you feel nothing on your eyes, but they were heavy and uncomfortable. During the process, the glue had STUNG MY EYES. It burned and the employee told me to just close my eyes for a few minutes longer. My right eye was blood shot red. A closer look into the mirror, she has glued a lash directly onto my eyelid. I have been told the lashes are to be glued onto the lashes, and NOT the eyelid. When I left the building, there was a glare in the upper portion of my vision due to the sun reflection off the eyelashes. I'm assuming it is because of poor lash quality (the lashes were slightly shiny). I thought I would get use to them, but with any touch of the lashes irritation and slight pain would occur. The next morning, my right eye was still super red, my coworkers thought I got pink eye! I went back to get them removed the next day. The staff didn't understand my concerns and kept stating they looked beautiful on me. Would not recommend this place to anyone.
