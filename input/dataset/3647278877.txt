Why do people still come here? The place is huge but they can't staff the bar with enough people for the crowd. Open the 3rd bar or beef up the bar staff to accommodate the people. It should never take 30 minutes to get a drink... not only that, but it's so loud the bartenders can't even hear what you're trying to order. The 1/2 off drink special for your "party" is a hoax. How do 4 drinks add up to $50 at half off?? And you're not even given an itemized receipt to verify what you're being charged for!
