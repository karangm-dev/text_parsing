Picked up lunch yesterday and was pretty disappointed. I had the turkey reuben and a friend had the chicken strips. The turkey reuben was nothing like a reuben besides having swiss cheese and being on marbled rye- no sauerkraut or thousand island. I was pretty disappointed with the reuben and definitely would not order it again. Also I asked for bbq sauce and it's probably my fault not for double checking that it was in the bag but I got home and they just put in ketchup and ranch. Food has been better when I've eaten there so maybe I'll stick with that from now on.
