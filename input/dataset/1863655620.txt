Husband and I went here for a date night.  It was around 5 and not busy.  They took our name and said they would be right with us.  As we sat there for 10 minutes, we saw 8 different groups come in and be seated immediately.  Some the same as us, groups of two.  A group of four and a group of three too.  All got seated before us as we stood there, 10 feet away.  We could see empty tables from where we're standing.  The hostess looked at us several times and simply ignored us.  I love the Cheesecake Factory and I was looking forward to it, but never again at this location.  We went across the street to the Hofbr√§uhaus House and enjoyed their wonderful food for the first time (they sat us immediately).  Horrible customer service.
