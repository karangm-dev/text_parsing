The service is terrible. David, the guy in charge is rude and was not very helpful. My car has been here for almost a month, they have been telling me it's gonna be ready for pick up for the last two weeks. Every time I call David says he will have it ready at the end of the day, it's been like this for literally 2 weeks. I find this ridiculous and would not re commend this auto shop. I just moved here and AAMCO had left a bad taste in my mouth. The have me back my car not running at all and with a dent.
