The worst experience ever they are such a liars and the Manager AJ is full oF BS, I paid the price for luxury suit on the view and when I got there they switched me to a different hotel not on the view and they said "ohh it's the same Venetian and Palazzo are the same " NOT THEY ARE NOT. You guys are scammers and who ever in-charge should really find a job as PERFECT LIAR, dear friends be aware they will try to scam you be removing the resort fees if you accept them to downgrade you. The worst experience ever will never ever come back. SHAME ON THEM. Nice hotel bad management typical scammers. I put one star I wish there is something lower than a star (Stay away) .
