My husband and I have tried this restaurant on 4 occasions all with poor service. Our final attempt was last week , on a Tuesday night. Drink orders took 10 min, and when our wine glasses were empty, another 15 to ask for another. Our pizza came out cold, the cheese had already hardened. The only saving grace was the calamari, so so. N more visits from us, to bad because cave creek is where we live and chose to spend our entertainment money
