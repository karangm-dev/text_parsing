They seem to have better looking items in their website.  The tacos on the website came with salsa and lime.  If you look at the pictures I posted, we never received any.  For $21 and lots of taco competition at much lower price points, I would definitely not order this again.  My main dish was a tuna blt at $29, the flavours were excellent!  Definitely small portioned item.  I loved the tuna and fried tomato.  Service was 2/5.  Had to chase for the bill at their counter.
