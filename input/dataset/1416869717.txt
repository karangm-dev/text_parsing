I had a non invasive procedure performed at this facility over a course of 6 weeks.  My first few appointments were completed with one technician who was very good, but unfortunately, she left for another job. While the overall results of the procedure were disappointing, the worst part of the experience was the huge turnover in staff. Each visit I interacted with new staff members that were "in training".  The training of the technicians seemed to be lacking and I was burned and electrically shocked.  I actually cancelled my final appointment as I could not bear the thought of further torture.  I would expect better from a board certified doctor's office. I do not recommend this facility for non invasive work performed by technicians
