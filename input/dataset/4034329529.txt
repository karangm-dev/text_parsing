This is without a doubt the greatest menu in town. I sat there for 20 minutes because everything looked, sounded;  (and in prior visits), tasted so good...that I couldn't decide. It's fun, eclectic, fast, priced right and the owner is right there making sure everything is done the way it's supposed to be done. I like the Bagel Café, but I LOVE the Beach Café! After all, would I rather be waiting and jammed in "at" a Bagel, or would I rather be at Beach? It's a no brainer.
