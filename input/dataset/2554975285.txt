The receptionists at University Dental Health Services (UDHS) are terribly rude and unkind. Beth stands out as someone who is not warm or helpful with respect to patients, abruptly hanging up phone calls with an "Uh-huh. Buh-bye." It is truly disheartening that I dread calling to schedule an appointment or to ask questions due to the team that is the front-line representatives of this practice. That being said, the clinical staff at UDHS is truly excellent. I have been a patient for the past 3 years and have had basic cleanings performed and interacted with several different dental hygienists. All have been extremely friendly and polite. The wait time is typically between 10 and 15 minutes. The dentists are also wonderful. Dr. Christine Wankiiri-Hale is exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable. Overall, I do not recommend coming to this establishment for a stellar customer service experience. Otherwise, I recommend their clinical expertise.
