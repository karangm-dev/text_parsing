We've been taking my car here for service for the last few years and just started taking my husband's car, as it's no longer under warranty. We've always received good service from them at reasonable prices. In one case, they were having a hard time diagnosing a problem with an oil leak and had to keep the car for awhile as they tried different things to replicate the problem. They kept us updated on what they were trying to do and finally figured it out, and the problem was fixed promptly thereafter. Front desk staff are always friendly and we're usually able to get in for service very quickly.
