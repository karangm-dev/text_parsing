I was hesitant to purchase a haircut groupon after a horrible experience I had over a year ago, but decided to give Rometrics a try since they had great reviews. I am so glad I did! The salon was great, the people were awesome. Ann Marie did an AMAZING job on my hair - it was exactly what I wanted and it looks incredible. The shampoo and condition and scalp massage felt great too. Ann Marie was friendly and easy to chat with. A great experience and I highly recommend Ann Marie and Rometrics!
