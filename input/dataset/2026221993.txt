Went to Sam Woo but it was packed so we went to Capital Seafood instead...BIG MISTAKE!   We ordered a whole Peking Duck, instead we got a Peking Cornish Hen.  It's like we got leftover duck parts put in one plate.  For sure it was not one whole duck on that plate.  No wonder they don't chop the duck at your table.   I wanted to complain but my friends asked me not to.  Anyway, if you absolutely want Peking Duck, go somewhere else.   We will NEVER go back to this restaurant.
