My experience  was SO BAD . had to pay extra upon the day of pick up and on the day of delivery ( I am talking hundreds of dollars ). They did not deliver on the requested date and had 1 week delay. they want you to be on their time. I was forced to pick up their driver in my personal car at 11 pm and guess what no delivery on that night. They forced me to leave work next day to come home with very short notice and if i don't show up or follow their short notice time/dat then i have to pay fine of 85 $ every hour ( Sure i was never told about any fine before that time). Very poor notification and they will take any opportunity to increase your rate by any mean. They don't care about your work or sleep. I got called one time at midnight by their dispatcher.They did not handle my furniture properly and i had severely damaged furniture. They referred me to their claim department which takes 120 days to get you a decision. They are nice people when you talk to them but very bad to get job done not get done properly.In summary :hidden fee and fine, damaged furniture with poor claim , delayed delver form the requested day. I WOUND NEVER RECOMMEND them to anyone.
