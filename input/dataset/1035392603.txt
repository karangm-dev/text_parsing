Don't let the size of this place fool you, they lack quality of product. I've been growing and also a consumer of Cannabis for over 20 years. Maybe it's because I come from different product standards in Cali, but this place sells old, dried out bud for high quality prices and after spending about $1000 every 5 days and receiving dried out bud almost every time, I finally mentioned something to the manager when I got a half ounce and it was the most dry bud I've ever seen. Her response was that she could give me 10% off another eighth. All the bud was still in the container. Just because they're the biggest store doesn't mean their anywhere near good quality - it's all a hype. BUYERS BEWARE: don't let the size fool you. This place lacks quality. You just lost a loyal and high spending customer. Set up your game! Bottom line, Vegas actually has some very high quality cannabis shops but this certainly isn't one of them, not even close!!
