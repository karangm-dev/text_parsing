I would give this place 0 stars if possible. The owner, Margarita could not have conducted herself in a worse way. My girlfriend went in to get her hair cut shorter, and Margarita acted like it was the worst thing she has ever had do. After it was all said and done, the haircut wasn't right and Margarita didn't even say goodbye. Then when we asked for someone to fix the haircut because it was wrong, Margarita said that my girlfriend isn't welcomed back again. PLEASE NEVER GO SUPPORT SOMEONE LIKE THIS!!!
