Nice little mom and pop type place. Had a ham and cheese sandwich and the bread tasted awesome and fresh. lettuce and tomoato on sandwich was fresh as well. my side was macaroni salad and it was good. same macaroni salad you would find at other places. restaurant was a nice little place and the owner was very friendly.
