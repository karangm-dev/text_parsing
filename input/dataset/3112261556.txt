My all-time favourite hang out spot! The staff are all friendly and personable, the atmosphere is a delight and the place is lovely! Not mention the quality product and the great big couches! Hands down the best hookah lounge in the valley. You won't find that holier-than-thou attitude I've gotten from staff at most of the other places around.They also offer live music several times a month and host group events. Make sure to come in early to avoid cover charges or a full lounge!
