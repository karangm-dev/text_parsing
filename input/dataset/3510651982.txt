So this place is great if you want to get pills for all sorts of problems. When it comes down to being a doctor, they are the worst. Miss diagnosed 3 times and let alone the prices for all their treatments. On top of that, they charge for paperwork that needs to be filled out for employer's when you get sick. Over all, my doctor now. Is not a doctor at all!!!!!!
