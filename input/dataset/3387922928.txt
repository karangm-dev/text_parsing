I visited the DH urgent care facility after a few days of having a strange feeling in my chest.  I was admitted quickly and seen by a nurse and a doctor.  They administered multiple tests including an EKG and blood work.  After a short while, the doctor came in and told me that I was experiencing premature ventricular contractions, or PVCs.  From his explanation it was quite serious and I needed to be admitted to a hospital immediately.  Unfortunately, the only hospital with an available bed, or so I was told, was at the Laveen DH facility.  I had never heard of this facility and I was cautious about being transported there.  I was assured that I would be monitored there over night and seen by a physician and cardiologist, so off I went.  Come to find out after I was admitted to the Laveen "Hospital" that not only was there not a cardiologist on duty, there was NO doctor on duty.  The nurse on duty called the doctor on call for instructions on my treatment. They gave me the standard treatment and drugs for a heart attack even though I didn't have one.  I was admitted at 10pm on a Friday evening and a doctor was not on duty until noon the next day.  When the doctor finally showed up, he looked at my chart and discharged me immediately.  I subsequently followed up with cardiologist and was told that PVCs happen all the time and they are nothing to worry about.  I understand that doctors can be overly cautious at times, but there just wasn't a need to send me to a hospital without staff that could evaluate and treat me properly.  I am very disappointed in Dignity Health.
