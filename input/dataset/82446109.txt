I can't say enough about this restaurant.  The staff has always been friendly, the atmosphere is very energetic, and the food it absolutely amazing!  I've had their burgers, salads and sandwiches and have never been disappointed.  The menu may be a bit too big but so far I've enjoyed ordering something new each time.  If I had to pick a personal fave, I'd say the steak salad, but would still want to try something new.The greatest thing about this restaurant is they are baby friendly.  So many mommies and strollers in here.
