Had a great night out at Fatheads! We were seated quickly for a party of 12 and our server was totally on his game. All our food came out hot and was delicious! The servings are GINORMOUS so if you are going to eat and not just drink then maybe you'd better fast for a day or two ahead of time! I had the Bumbleberry Beer which is a smooth brew with low undertones of blueberry and the mellow sweet flavor of honey, served with a few blueberries bobbing in my glass. For dinner I had the Prime Dip; prime rib thinly sliced in some crusty brioche, melted provolone, mushrooms and onions along side a hefty serving of home style potato chips, seasoned with salt and pepper.Altogether a thoroughly enjoyable evening with our friends!
