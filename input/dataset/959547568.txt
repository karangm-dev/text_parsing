Terrible customer service. Called the store and spoke to Nick about having a new magazine tube installed on my Benelli M4. He told me that it could be done today. I arrived 5 minutes after hanging the phone up and spoke with another employee.He told me that Nick was busy with two other guns and he would not be able to get to mine for two days. Don't trust what you hear on the phone I guess? Will not be returning for any reason and I will urge those I work with to do the same. Thank you Spartan arms for helping me whittle down my gun store choices.
