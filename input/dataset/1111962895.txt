Just got a pedicure here. My technician did take quite a long time, but it was well worth it considering his attention to detail.  The salon was extremely clean. There was also a decent selection of pedicures, some on the pricier side.  I chose the lemon pedicure ($35) and it was very refreshing.  I believe the basic pedicure was only $25.
