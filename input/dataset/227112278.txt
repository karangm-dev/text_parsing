I have had 2 bad experiences here. I wrote off the first one until I had the second one...First, we had a tire with a screw in it, so we bought one new tire. The first time we get on the interstate and get up to 60mph the whole car starts shaking. We took the car back and had them re-balance the new tire. Problem solved, but never should have been an issue in the first place.The second bad experience is when I took our 08 Scion xB to be inspected. It took almost 2 hours. They failed it for factory window tint that has not been modified for the 9 years that we have owned the car. It has always passed and I have taken it to multiple inspection stations over the years.I took the car to a different inspection station and they passed it. NTB would not issue a refund for their mistake. I believe there is confusion about it being a "multipurpose" vehicle or not (ie: SUV, minivan, pickup type vehicle) which can dictate how dark the back windows can be. According to the government website: ftp://safercar.gov/MfrMail/ORG4620.pdf it is considered multipurpose vehicle.Either way, I'm done with this place now.
