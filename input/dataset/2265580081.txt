So let me start out. The ambiance of the facility is amazing.  Very classy.  But that doesn't compensate for the service I received.   I was the first person at the door and when we walk in we're notified that there is a 30 minute wait for preparation.  I honestly feel they should have came in 30 mins earlier instead of making a customer wait.I was a little disappointed that 2 groups of women with sundresses came in 30 mins after me and received their food before me.  There has to be a Happy medium.   It's not right to let the "sex sells" slogan consume your site of all customers being treated fairly and equally. To be honest I wish had just went to IHOP but I tried to be a good person and support black business.  This place will not be recommended to anybody I knowThe food on a scale of a 1-10 was a 7 if the service was better I'd give a 8.  My meal was the salmon and grits.
