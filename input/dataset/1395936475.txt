I have to post my review. I stayed here 2 nights for baseball games. The time I was in the hotel weren't very good experiences. I wanted to pay cash when I checked out, but they charged my card, at 1 am the fire alarm goes off I call the desk to find out what's going on they said if u don't feel safe come to the lobby? I'm sorry but that's not how u handle a fire alarm situation. I have emailed them and they supposedly handled the situation. I'm really skeptic on staying at another holiday inn as this was my 1st experience in this chain.
