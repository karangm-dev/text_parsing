My mom won a gift certificate at a fundraiser and passed it off to me, as she isn't a salon-type of a girl. I have been on the quest to find the perfect stylist and keep coming up short. I hate spending $150 every time I get my hair done, but whenever I go for a salon that may be cheaper, I end up regretting it and hating my hair.I digress ---- Yesterday I had a cut and highlight (balayage) with Tina. She made my hair look incredible. I've received so many compliments, including that I look like a I'm 18 (I'm 30!) She's totally awesome and sweet. I will be re-booking with her for my next appointment. I recommend her to everyone!
