Normally I wouldn't write a review for a mass chain like Costco, because as so many Yelpers before me have stated-everyone knows what to expect out of a Costco.  Giant warehouse, cheap yummy pizza, HUGE bags of chips, and gallons of ketchup.....However, that being said, as a member for over a year, I have enjoyed a few things that i thought I would share and have recently discovered.  #1)  If you are having a large gathering where there should be a sheet cake-ORDER IT HERE!  A sheet cake serves 48 people (minimum) and is only $17.99....AND IT'S DELICIOUS!  I ordered one for my boyfriends' birthday and decided on the vanilla cake, which is baked with a layer of cheesecake mousse and vanilla buttercream frosting....I got so many compliments at the party and people still talk about it!  #2)  The gas is cheap---NUFF SAID.#3)  If you are a fan of rotisserie chicken (I use it for recipes calling for cooked or boiled chicken as it tastes better and saves me time), they are always $5!  Yay!  #4)  For anyone loving the Jack's Fresh Salsa....they have a large sized tub for only $7....this is perfect for a gathering!  And so fresh tasting!  #5)  And finally, the steaks are perfection!  I have gotten many different cuts of beef from here from ribeyes to filets to roast cuts and every single time they are wonderful.  Honestly, if you are wanting to impress someone on a date night or a party-bring a steak from here!  That's my 5 tips for Costco.....yeah, they also have tons of samples at all times which isn't a bad thing.  Makes the shopping trip more fun :)
