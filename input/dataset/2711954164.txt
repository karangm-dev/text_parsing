Seriously my new favorite place in old town to go after work. Great happy hour prices but I totally underestimated the amount of food they give you when I first came here and overate haha. The taco bowls are huuuuuge. I also love love love that you can get jicama and cucumber as a side. And honestly the only thing that Diego Pops is missing is flan in their dessert menu. If they added that I would be there every day.
