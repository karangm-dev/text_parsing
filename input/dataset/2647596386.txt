About 4-5 months ago I was in need of a new carrier because my contract with AT&T was about to end in a free days so I was on the hunt. I heard from my co workers at sprint it's $80 for unlimited everything PLUS a 20% discount for working at Planet Hollywood. I walked into this store and was helped by Angelo. He was awesome during my visit. One thing that confused me was I needed to order a new IPhone since mine was with AT&T. Whatever, it was free. Te only problem was the delivery since my phone was gonna be shut off soon. Turned out he type in my address wrong and I got the phone late and was phone less for two days. He apologized alot so it wasn't a biggie. Here's the problem though:I needed to bring in a copy of my pay stub for proof of working at planet Hollywood and when I went in this guy Narsi (or close to that) was such a jerk! He was rude, barely spoke to me, but talked up a storm to his associates and laughed so loudly. He took a photo of my pay stub and told me it'll take a month or two. Narsi, it's been four to five months now and nothing! It doesn't make me feel good that you have a picture of my personal information. Don't get helped by this guy.
