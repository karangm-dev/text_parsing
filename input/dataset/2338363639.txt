I really wanted to like this place, however, I tried the caramel and strawberry cheesecakes and both were very heavy with not much flavor. I had the lemon cake as well, same problem. Not much flavor and although I was told it had cream cheese icing, this was not the case. I LOVE their candy apples and went in today to get one.  Unfortunately, they didn't have any so against my better judgment, I ordered the lemon pound cake. Another disaster. VERY heavy. So, I've learned my lesson; candy apples only for me.
