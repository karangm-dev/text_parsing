Pharmacy is ridiculous. Waited in line 30 minutes and only as they turned off the light they started to take customers off the line. Silly us, we try to get there at least 30 minutes before they close. We had to pick up a couple weeks ago and was the same deal. We wanted flu shots, but gotta go to Walgreens or cvs. I feel bad for the employees as it appears to be scheduling.  However, we pay to spend money here, seems kinda stupid of us.
