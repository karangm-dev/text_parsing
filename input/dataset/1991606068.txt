I've been making payment to this company for a little over 3 years and they aren't my 1st choice since I do have bad credit but that is on me. What I am writing about is how I was treated recently. Mailed my check off in June and they never received it so I resent one. It's been a week and it hasn't cleared. I contacted Natasha this morning and she said they received the check but can't post it since I had two back to back NSF over a year ago(2014). I explained that April 2015 and May's 2015 payment cleared the bank and I couldn't understand why I wasn't notified that they received my checks but couldn't post it or even let me know since I was under the assumption since they accepted the two other recent payment's via check? She didn't have a reason for it. This is very frustrating because now I have to drive 25 minutes to make a cash payment so I don't run the risk of a repo. :(
