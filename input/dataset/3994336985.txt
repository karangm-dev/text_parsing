I come here to this gas station every now and then only if I really have to otherwise I go somewhere else and I don't mind paying extra to be treated with some better customer service and respect.  The gentleman who works in the evenings with a name tag "Will" is one of the rudest cashiers.  Just looks at you and doesnt acknowledge if he is done with your transaction or if he is ready to help you or is even willing to help you.  This place is not good, 0 service they need new workers specially evening.
