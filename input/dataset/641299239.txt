Nice enough theatre, but not a great overall experience.  Only one person working the ticket counter at 7pm on a Saturday night.  Long line to get tickets meant standing outside in the sun.  No kiosks.  Screen, sound and chairs were good.  Way too hot.  I've never walked out of a theatre with swamp ass before.  10 mins of commercials prior to the "start time" followed by another 30 mins of previews.  Talk about pinching pennies and squeezing every ounce of profit out of the movie experience.  I'd liken it to one of those free iPhone games with adds running constantly.  Cheap. Cheap.
