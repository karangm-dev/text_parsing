Love it! Was looking for an old school barbershop to take my toddler to. They were great with him and gave him the tightest fade and a great rockabilly haircut. The decor is between old school barbershop and a tattoo shop which is cool and they also do hot towel treaents which is awesome. And the haircuts are only $15!! I've gone to hair salons trying to getting son an old school rockabilly cut and paid $50 and didn't get the results that I got here. I'd highly recommend this barbershop.
