This is the first business I have felt compelled to write a review for ever, on any website. My experience with Junction Optometrists has always been poor. The two optometrists I have seen were excellent; helpful, competent and friendly. Unfortunately the pricing and the staff are way below par.Each of the 4 times I have been, there have either been extremely long delays or mix ups with appointment times (not just for me, I have overheard other customers supposedly "confusing" their appointment times). I have been 'surprised' by pricing that they neglected to tell me about prior to my appointment. The staff are very disorganized and easily confuse the products you are trying or ordering.I have dropped a lot of money into this business, and will now be cutting my losses and going elsewhere.
