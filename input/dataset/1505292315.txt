Would've been great except for the fact that the staff was rude. The atmosphere was cool. Love the lighting against the wall color. Bar is well stocked and cocktails are pretty good. But the staff, manager mainly, was beyond rude while the band was playing. Making a scene about how bad they were even though everyone there loved them!
