Not impressed. I went in to have two pairs of pants hemmed. My wife (who DOES know how to sew but is too busy working to sew these for me) pinned the pants at the correct length. The lady at Ale Maria's basically refused to sew them because she didn't want to chance that the hem would be wrong. I agreed that I would even sign a waiver so she could get started, but no.So, now I have to find another tailor/alteration shop to do my work.Update:I took my pants to Kim's Custom Tailor Etc 7023 N Litchfield RdGlendale, AZ  85307. My pants were done in two days and they are perfect! Thank you Ale Maria's for turning me down. I found a place closer to my house that does great work!
