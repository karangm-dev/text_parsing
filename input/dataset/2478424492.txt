Cute cute place with good food! Surprising since it's on the first floor of an office building but I'm not judging by the cover;)We had the cheese fondue as an appetizer which was so so good!!! The Mahi entree I had was a little more rare then I'd like but it was a good new experience. I loved the asian cabbage slaw and the sticky rice was divine. There was sauce on the mahi and on the plate but it was not overwhelming at all. They know what they are doing there! I would TOTALLY go back again!!!
