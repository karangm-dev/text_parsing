Had the best time learning to dance with Johnathan DE Garcia.  He was patient and showed us what we wanted to learn.  He is charming and funny.  And a great dancer (obviously).  The parties and group classes are also very helpful. They let you experience real world dance parties.  What kind of dance for different  types of music,  dancing with different people, etc.  All in all the best experience!  We will remember this for life! Thank you!
