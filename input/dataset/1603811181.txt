When you are a out-of-towner traveling around the first thing aside from experiencing the sites of a new city or the eats that you can seek find and destroy! Zablong attracted that I with its flatbread esque style pizza. With fresh ingredients in the ability to create your own pizza this street was nothing short of spectacular! I very much enjoyed my pizza and that I would definitely bookmark this for future visits whenever I am in the Charlotte area!
