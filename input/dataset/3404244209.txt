Being from Italy, Florence, to be precise, my wife and I were curious about this much touted place as being authentic, to the point of resembling a pizzeria in Naples. I lived and worked in Naples for some years on the Italian hit soap opera Un Posto al Sole (a Place in the Sun). Much to our dismay we found this place to be dingy and unkept, and our table had scratch marks on it. The place could have used a paint job. Pizzerias in Naples may be small, but they are neat. This was 8 months back so maybe by now it's been improved. I can only speak of our experience at the time. The pizza was adequate but nothing to drive more than five miles for. If you happen to be in the area and want a pizza by all means stop in, otherwise go to Pizza Bianco, named one of the top ten pizzerias in the country.
