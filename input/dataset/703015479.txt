I was in a bind with shipping a laptop and was on the way to OfficeMax when I saw this place pop up on yelp for shipping services. I figure I'd walk in and ask if they sell supplies and packaging, I was super happy with the warm greeting and the man (I forgot his name) answered all of my questions.Super painless experience, I've been to some other shipping spots where I get the cold shoulder or have to pay cash only (after I got my packaging set up) or just rude staff. This is a breath of fresh air and since I don't live far from this location I will be coming here in the future.
