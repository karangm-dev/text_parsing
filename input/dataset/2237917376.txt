Berge Mazda. I want to start by saying I we didn't buy a car there, but I was considering it buying a mazda 3. We had Bryan as our sales man. He did a great job showing us the cars and explaining  everything about them. We went back a second time then we decided to run numbers and that's were we stopped. We decided not to purchase there or return because of  the finance guy, his name was James (he has a funny hair do, like pee wee herman) He was rude and condescending. He thought he could fool us around with numbers and when we finally asked for the breakdown of numbers because we were tired, he looked at my husband and told him that he needed to relax, he was "tense" and asked him why? We didn't appreciate the way he spoke to us and treated us. Bryan the sales man did a great job, but we never went back due to this guy. He made Berge Mazda lose the business.
