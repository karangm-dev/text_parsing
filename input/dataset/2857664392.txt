By far the best AMC I've been to. The pre selected seating arrangement is pretty handy although as some reviews have mentioned it can fill up fast on busy days. Sunday matinee shows are usually empty. I love the retractable seats and large leather chairs with ample room for drinks and food. It's the same price as harkins and other theaters. Why would you go anywhere else?
