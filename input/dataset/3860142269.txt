My family and I took a trip to Scottsdale last month. We were told about The Thumb from the concierge at our hotel. My boyfriend LOVES BBQ and housemade sauces so we knew we had to try it. We went for lunch one day and was blown away! After lunch we spent another 30 minutes walking around the store! We loved it so much that we all went back the following night for dinner and bought 3 of their housemade sauces. We are already running out of them and wondering how to get more! We love The Thumb & will be back!
