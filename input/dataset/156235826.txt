Wow that was good. Got the tiramisu in a cup and man I kinda wanted to eat the plastic cup too.  It was awesome! My son got a birthday cake macaron and devoured it.  The crime was fresh and delicious.  What's cool is the laid back atmosphere.  Plus you didn't get the whole uppity feel I've gotten from other pastry shops.  You know the I'm a bad ass cuz I can make a cupcake and it's hot on TV right now.  Overall will be coming back!
