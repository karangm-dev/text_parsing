I've ordered from this location a couple of times based on having Guys at their Downtown location. Bad choice and never again.The last time I ordered, I paid for an extra container of salad dressing. Not only did they forget the extra dressing I paid for, but they forgot the container of dressing that should come with the salad. Thanks for the undressed salad, Guys!The time before that, they forgot the 2 liter I ordered and paid for.Looks like I'll be forgetting to order from this location.
