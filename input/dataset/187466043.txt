My friends and I came here for my birthday this weekend. It was amazing. From the amazing service, to how dog friendly they were with my poodle, to how COLD their pool is, to the free drinks we got with our room, to tim, who brought our bags to the room and brought us games and ice. It was a blissfully perfect staycation. I looked forward to coming to the hotel palomar for a couple of months and I was not disappointed.We ended up not having to pay for parking because of the special we got but that would be the one thing that would deter me from a 5 star review. Phoenix just isn't the type of city to procure $30 parking fees.If you are a dog lover this is the place. They brought my dog a bed, dishes, placemat, and allowed him to go everywhere I went. I can't wait till the next staycation!Thank you:)
