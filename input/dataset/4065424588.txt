I bought a $29 Groupon for this place. 30 minutes of the initial meeting was a consultant trying to get me to buy a hypnosis package worth THOUSANDS of dollars.I will not be returning. I was expecting a hypnosis session with an actual person. They put you in a dark room, sit you in a reclining chair and put specialized glasses on you that emit blinking blue lights. They then play a CD with a creepy male voice for an hour. After getting up out of the chair I felt nauseous. The blinking lights created a motion sickness feeling. This did not work at all. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
