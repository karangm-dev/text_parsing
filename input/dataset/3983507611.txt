Everything about our experience was wonderful. The tomato bocconici salad was delicious. It was served with the appropriate amount of balsamic. The steaks were cooked perfectly. Interesting note is that Canadian cattle raised for prime beef are fed barley. The taste is noticeably different and terrific. The onion rings were served with a spicy sauce. So delicious. The creamed spinach was served with just the right amount of sauce and melted cheese. Service was also very good. Attentive but not overbearing. All in all a very wonderful experience.
