I'm a great advocate for OReillys except this one. I went in today to see if they could help me re my fuses being out. The young man would have sooner helped himself to extra pizza than help me. I didn't know how to check for fuse outages nor silo I know how to pull fuses out. He refused to lend me pliers or show me what to do. I went to a competitor and they gladly helped me. In fact not only did they check it but they gave me two free fuses.
