I will not be going to this barber shop anymore. Number one, they were talking shit saying some very racist things about a man and his daughter when they walked out because of there race. Secondly I was getting a haircut one day and when I was very exhausted from work one day and didn't realize until I went home that I accidentally paid double for my hair cut because I had already paid on yelp. When I called the owner and let him know, he did not want to solve the issue and said that my barber accepted it as a tip. I don't know what world you live in but no one pays $26 for a basic hair cut...and the fact that he is that greedy that he does not want to at least offer me a refund...
