A bit expensive, but really solid service and excellent final product. I had to order cupcakes for someone in Illinois and I ordered extremely custom design (Magic: The Gathering if you must know). Not only did they pull it off, they ROCKED it, and the dude who got the cupcakes was super duper happy. The cupcakes themselves were basically nirvana and totally awesome. So really, they are completely a 4-5 star joint--just be warned that they are more expensive than other custom cupcake orders. But, quite honestly, for this level of quality? It is worth it.
