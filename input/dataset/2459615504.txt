Terrible customer service, sale items are not in stock or in very limited quantities.  Store is dirty, cashiers (older ones) are all rude, meat selection is lacking and their price match policies are ridiculous.  Only honour coupons/sales from stores within 1 square km of them.  I drive to Markham and get my groceries.  Only come here when i need something quick and even then I will go to Metro first.
