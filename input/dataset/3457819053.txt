Went to Best Buy first to get an iPod touch for my daughters 11th bday and they were out of stock so I called Future Shop first to find out if the iPod I needed was in stock. My girls bday was the next day and as per usual I left getting her a gift to the last day!  My first attempt was unsuccessful as I was told to call back because I called the wrong dept my 2nd attempt the call was answered and then quickly cut off, I called back about half a doz. times while driving there and never got through, I figured that because Best Buy was so busy that Future Shop was too and that's why I couldn't get anyone on the phone? Well was I wrong! The store was empty! Tons of sales reps standing around with nothing to do! I knew exactly what I wanted so my interaction with the sales guy was brief and un eventful but the extremely frustrating phone calls before hand left a sour taste in my mouth. Gunna stick to Best Buy and give myself some wiggle room in case what I need isn't in stock!
