I had a blast here and can't wait to go again! Best pool party ever! Love the layout of the venue and the music. The pool isn't as swampy as other Vegas pool parties in Vegas- thank God! I can't wait to go here again! We arrived there around noon and didn't end up leaving till almost 6pm. Time really flies when you're having fun!
