We order from this Pizza Hut often and always order a very similar order a stuff crust pizza with chicken, Bacon, and onion on half. We ordered today and the pizza had onion on the whole thing. The manager was rude and didn't want to replace the pizza. After telling him I will come in and talk to the store manager did he change his attitude toward the situation.
