I hate that my review is going to contribute to the growing popularity of this place and me waiting longer to get a table in the future, but oh well.This place has the best beer selection that I've seen in the city. The variety of beers is unparalleled. barVolo doesn't touch this Barhop! I also like that they let you do samplers of their draft beers.The food is pretty good, too.Really they excel at all the things I've complained that was wrong about barVolo (see my other review).
