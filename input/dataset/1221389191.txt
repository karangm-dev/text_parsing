Having lived in Spain, the menu looked really promising and exciting. I took my boyfriend to try the tapas bar. We had no problem finding a seat near the windows, around 6pm. We were sort of intrigued as to why the host took coats from the dinner guests, but not from those sitting in the tapas area. Our server helped us choose wines that we enjoyed, but the food didn't blow us away. We tried many of the tapas, but the only ones we would order again were the anchovies with kale, jamon and bacalao croquetas, and the cheese curds. Our two small glasses of wine were 12 and 14 dollars, and most tapas were 3-5 bucks. We spent $65 dollars on a "dinner" that was mediocre at best.
