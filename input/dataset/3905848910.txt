Never in life will I ever rent from this company again. It took 30 mins for the shuttle to pick us up. It was 102 degrees outside and I was 7 months pregnant waiting forever. All of the other off site companies came multiple times to pick up their passengers during my wait. Once we got to the location I learned that the small SUV I rented weeks ago was not available. I needed and SUV to transport the many boxes I needed for the event I was planning over the weekend. The place screams scammer. I asked a gentleman outside when would the shuttle return to go back to the main car rental center. He said 25-30mins. I caught and Uber back and rented a car with a major company. Beware if you book a car through Priceline and this is the company. I wouldn't even give them a one star but I had to in order to make this post.
