My wife and I stopped by today for a quick lunch. We had the Bistek, and it was great. My wife took some pork(adobo? Not sure)carry out and some kind of flan or pudding. I would ask her but she's at work. I know the place is good when my wife says it's good, instead of "fine", which really means " it is borderline shite" in Filipino. She's picky with food, especially Filipino fare. MacArthur said he would return but never did. We will  return, asap.Oh, and at the risk of being pedantic, this place in Parma, not Cleveland.
