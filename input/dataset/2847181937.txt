I waited a month and a half for my appointment only to be turned away. They asked for my Culinary insurance card and I told them that I wasn't issued one nor have I ever needed to produce it before. All the other doctors/dentists that have seen me have never asked. With Culinary, the insurance is the person's SSN and nothing is written on the card but the words "Culinary Health Fund" and the person's name. No one carries their card because it's useless and doctors/dentists call and verify coverage if you're new to that clinic. I asked them to call and they said no. I told them I knew my number and they said no. I asked why I wasn't informed a month and a half prior and the receptionist just stared at me cluelessly...
