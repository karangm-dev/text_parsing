One of my top spots downtown when you want to either get some work done during the day (and not have to purchase expensive coffee to sit down), PLUS they have super fast FREE internet so that always makes working better. At night you can play giant sized games (like giant connect four, beer pong, and jenga). Check it out! I can promise you won't be let down.
