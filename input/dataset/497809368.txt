On a Saturday night smack in the middle of high season here and 2/3 of the tables are empty. Still, it took 15 minutes to even get water and another 10 minutes to get wine which I later noticed was in a glass covered in lint. Our waiter was trying his best to cover his nine, yes 9, tables. Yes, yes the spectacular toast with stuff on it was great. We've been to three other restaurants in Kierland and had much better wine and apps with good service.
