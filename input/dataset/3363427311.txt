We were referred to Elizabeth Pediatrics and specifically, Dr. Ball by a family friend.  Simply put, we could not be more pleased with Dr Ball.   Our first daughter just had her 1 year checkup so we have been seeing Dr. Ball for just over 1 year.   From before the birth, to our time at the hospital and now, we are extremely pleased with our decision.
