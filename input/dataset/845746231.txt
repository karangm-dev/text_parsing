I got the unlimited wash and went to use it my first time today. We got back from a long road trip. The fast pass didn't let me through, so it took about 10 min to get into the wash. Not a biggie. I figured it was just a glitch. After the wash, my car still had tons of bugs on it, so I was going to go through again and the guy told me it was once a day. I explained to him that unlimited means unlimited, but regardless my first wash didn't clean my car. The way he responded was not the customer service I would have anticipated from a new business. It may have been an off day, but if it continues I will cancel my pass. I am not planning on washing my car every day or even every week, but it seems like if the car doesn't get clean on the first run through they'd automatically send you back through.
