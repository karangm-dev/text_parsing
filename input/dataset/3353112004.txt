On Sept 21, 2016, We had our car serviced at South Charlotte Hyundai for an oil change/lube and left with a $224.11 bill. It would have been more, but I refused the recommended wheel alignment. This is only my opinion, but unless my car is handling badly or I notice unusual tire wear, I always skip this costly recommendation. I found a website on the internet that stated,  "It takes a lot to knock your car out of alignment; your average run-of-the-mill pothole won't do it." If your interested in reading the entire article you can find it at: http://www.roadandtravel.com/carcare/alignment.htmlIn all fairness there may be other websites that have a different view of the necessity of wheel alignment. They did talk me into a brake fluid exchange, which again in my opinion is questionable. I wish I would have checked the fluid myself before agreeing, that was my fault. They charged $159.95 for the brake fluid exchange.This is only my opinion, but I just don't have a good feeling about South Charlotte Hyundai and I'm going to be getting my car serviced elsewhere.I am not a car repair expert and do not have any affiliation with any car repair related websites or companies. I'm writing this review for informational purposes only. My final comment is, "buyer beware".
