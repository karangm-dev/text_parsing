I have visited Halo several times for piercing needs since I turned 18, and I have to say they are great!  The staff is super helpful and informed, the space is CLEAN!! and they have a huge selection of jewelry to pick from.  I have been thinking about getting my nose pierced again, so I stopped in a few days ago. Not only did they answer every single question I had (and believe me, there were plenty), but they also showed me a lot of different jewelry options and helped me figure out what I wanted to do.  I highly recommend you stop in if you are in the mood for some body modification.  (P.S. they also have regular jewelry like necklaces, rings, and bracelets, too!)
