We decided to have Halibut House on Easter Saturday.  Boy were we amazed at the fish and chips we got!  First off we visited a Fish and Chips place on Brock Rd. that opened up on Good Friday and were so disappointed with what we got.  Not only that but they charging 2.75 for every can of pop... (That's outrageous!)  We were so discouraged but decided to give a shot to Halibut House anyway.First off, Gerry the manager of the location was absolutely amazing.  He was very approachable and kind.  My wife and I found ourselves having nostalgic/insightful discussions about a wide range of topics with Gerry.  The prices for the food were well priced and the staff besides Gerry were very friendly.Since then we have visited 3 more times.  Every single time we visited it's been the same amazing service, great food and great conversations.The fish is nicely battered and well cooked.  The chips are very crispy as well.  The best part for me is that the food isn't extremely oily like at other locations in Pickering.  Every single time we go to Halibut House in Pickering we are not disappointed.  This is one of the best Fish and Chips places in Pickering, you should definitely go!
