First time there and service was slow, even at 6 pm.  Not many were there.  We left and came back a little later and one of the people we were with was cut off because he was "stumbling" but our friend was fine. Maybe if your floors were a little even, he wouldn't have stumbled.  He's not a regular, therefore doesn't know your issues.  I'm not even a regular and tripped on your floors, twice! We let the issue with your "security" guard, Chris, go.  Our friend went to the bar to get me a beer and was denied.  Again, he was fine.  I actually saw many folks for real stumbling and were actually drunk but yet they were freely getting beer from the bar.  Not to mention, before we left, the same guy followed my husband in the bathroom and watched him!  He said something to him and the "security" guy walked out.  Ridiculous! Our group was extremely upset and immediately cashed out.  Took almost 15 minutes to even leave because it took that long!  Then my husband was chest bumped, purposely, by someone who knew the "security" guard as we left.  Words were exchanged, Needless to say, it didn't get far..... We won't be back for sure!
