Only gave one star cause i had to. Do not waste your time with this company. My landlord made an appt with them to do a home clean out from the last tenants. She called and spoke with a lady that was very nice saying that they would be able to be there the next day by 11. She bought a groupon for 160dollars worth of cleaning and asked if the house needed more cleaning then just 160's worth what would happen. The lady said they wouldn't just "leave you hanging" that they would stay till the job was done. Sounds good. Well my landlord waited at the house from 11-12:30 no cleaners. Called the company and the lady on the phone said that she saw the house on the schedule and would call her right back after she called the crew to see where they were. Yeah never called back. My landlord called me and said she would leave the house open and a note on the door incase they showed up. My boyfriend and i waited till 3pm to show up at the new place. Yep still nothing! My landlord has been calling for 3days and still no calls back. Such a waste of time!!!! Why did they even bother answering the phone the first time if they don't want your business!?!?!????!!
