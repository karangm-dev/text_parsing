Man... The times I have in here and the many times I've come in here.  Byron the bartender has always made it enjoyable for me and the Wife.  He is the biggest reason why we keep going back and we Lee bringing friends.Thank you Byron for always giving us your undivided attention, making us laugh, giving us our drinks with a smile and a compliment and I'd give an extra star but he like the Dallas Cowboys... =P jkHere's to Byron!
