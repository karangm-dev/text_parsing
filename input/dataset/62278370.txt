Petinos means rooster in Greek and that's a good thing since you'll certainly need one if you plan to wake up during the weekends to get to Petinos early enough to avoid the much warranted line-ups outside this breakfast joint. This place is busy... real busy.... and for good reason!Their website vaguely boasts a variety of 250 choices to choose from and when you'll get around to the menu.... you can see why! They have something for everyone and you can mix it up to get what YOU want.I went with the "Le Petinos" a huge breakfast plate with a variety of meats and eggs. I won't necessarily break it down how everything tasted but overall it was simply exceptional with no disappointments. I particularly loved their home-style potatoes that were simply out of this world good. The other patrons at my table all enjoyed their meals with very well presented grub even though they had a lot of clients at the door. They truly ensure to make sure you don't feel rushed when you're dining there. Did I mention to potatoes? Yeahhhhhh.... but everything else was on spot too... but them taters..... *drool*The service was really good as well despite how busy it was. It was attentive with plenty of coffee refills. We were probably their more difficult table with 3 toddlers but we were well taken care of while we took care of our toddlers to not bother the other patrons. :) The food arrived in a timely fashion along with every needed check-up. It was impressive.Laval has some real stiff breakfast competition and Petinos is one of the best place you can choose your most important meal of the day. Heard this place from word of mouth... usually this type of hype doesn't meet expectations... I was glad it did.Will be back... again and again.
