Piano was my one of my favorite restaurants. However, it's extremely disappointed that I found hair in a cup of hot water. I didn't have chance to take a picture of it cuz the waiter took the water away immediately. Then the manager came to ask if they can offer me sth. But image how gross to find out hair in water and how can people want food from here anymore?
