First thing's first: Hidden Figures was phenomenal. That's the good news. I attended a 7:30 showing on a Saturday evening and it was miserable dealing with ALL of the terrible teenagers in the theatre. They were unsupervised, unruly, restless, and went unchecked by security through the ENTIRE movie.Security needs to be present INSIDE of the theaters when they expect high turnout. It wouldn't be difficult, as the worst of the teenagers come in late and sit at the front. Furthermore, the restrooms were clean, but half of them had no tissue and were therefore not usable. Management needs to do better. Maybe I'll give this theatre a shot on a school day when the youth of America is working on their studies. Until then, I won't be back after the sun goes down on non school nights -_-
