This Galleria Mall location sucks!  Long wait just to order our food, then I should have known it was terrible when I went to the bathroom to wash my hands.  I just about slipped walking there. The floor was not only greasy but dirty. Then I opened the bathroom door and those floors were even dirtier.  The food came and was mediocre. I got charged for sweet potato fries even though I had told the server I didn't want them. The waiter also forgot about giving us a refill or fries after we ordered them. He then had the manager come to the table to correct the incorrect fries charge. Well he was totally rude and told me there was a charge for the upgraded fries.... instead of apologizing for their mistake, he made me feel like I was trying to get free fries. Ridiculous.  Never will go here again!Horrible experience
