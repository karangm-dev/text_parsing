Hate to give this place a bad review, but. .. service was not good, he said they were understaffed so perhaps not his fault. The food was not great. A few of the ingredients on my salad had turned. My husbands tuna melt tasted old as well. Not sure if it was just an off day, but I don't think we will be back. :(
