DONT BE FOOLED BY THE PHOTOS on their webiste. Seriously I cant believe this place is considered a "timeshare".  I would catergorize this place as a refurbized MOTEL 6!!We spent the Thanksgiving week in Vegas to visit my bf's family. His sister was very kind to let us use our time share credit to stay in a place, and Club De Soleil was the one available for the week we were visiting. We were ecstatic to get such a good rate for the week, but soon that excitement deflated quickly! To make this long story short I'm going straight to the pros and cons:Pro:Close to stores and food..thats it. Con:-Rooms smelled like smoke!!-Cleaning is done one ONCE!!!! for the week you are staying.-The front desk attendants don't seem to care about customer service and tell you whatever you want to hear.-The walls are paper thin and you WILL hear your neighbors talking, yes talking! The walls are that thin and it will sound like they are in your unit.-Make sure to get what you need when you check in. We received a parking citation because we didn't get the parking placard  for our car because they NEVER GAVE IT to us when we first checked in.-Get your goodie bag. AGAIN! Make sure you get this when you check in because they failed to do this too. -Be prepared to shower in hard water and with cheap drying soap.-There is no service at this place. Be prepared to be neglected and do everything yourself, Seriously I would have rather paid more money and stayed at a HOTEL, not MOTEL aka timeshare. We will definitely NOT be coming back here or recommending this place.
