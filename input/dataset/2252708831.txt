I stopped here recently on the recommendation of a close friend, and was not dissapointed.  This is an excellent, adorable 'mom and pop' family Italian restaurant with great food!  The pasta is homemade, and the service was fantastic.  My daughter got the spaghetti and meatballs, which she loved.  I got the seafood manicotti alfredo, and it was 'to die for'.  So flavorful, with large portions to boot.  Prices were good too, and at this point, I honestly don't see a reason to go to the national chain Italian restaurants anymore!  Great job Dominic Santos!
