House band was OK.  I ordered a Guiness....which is a little strange I guess in a redneck bar.  The beer cost $8....I gave a $10 and received $12 change.  I wish the casino was like this!  Of course I corrected the mistake.I didn't order any food because it was 1am or so.  I did see the clientele at this time of night, and I must say it is nothing but older rednecks. I am from Texas...but come on.  Too many old rednecks.  They have their own dancing and mating rituals which I am still not accustomed.  The main problem with the place is the location.  It is upstairs in a cubby hole.  Difficult to find and just strange.  I do not understand who thought the location was a good idea.  I believe the decision to place the bar in this area went like this:Harrah's Executive #1: "So...what do we put in this isolated 'dungeon-like' place?"Harrah's Executive #2: "How about a redneck bar?"Harrah's Executive #1: "What exactly is a redneck bar?"Harrah's Executive #2: "A bar that attracts rednecks."Harrah's Executive #1: "So how do we attract rednecks?"Harrah's Executive #2: "Get a country singer that likes guns and sings like crap to scribble his name all over it and put some cheesy crap that he touched throughout the place."Harrah's Executive #1: "So....Toby Keith?"Harrah's Executive #2: "Bingo!"
