Went here with three couples on Valentine's Day and had the unfortunate luck of getting "Aubrey" as our server. From the very beginning, she came across as very snooty and condescending. It made the whole table feel uncomfortable to the point of almost requesting another server. During the entire meal, she made little snide remarks and felt the need to correct us about everything from the type of coffee they serve, whether the cappuccino was sweetened, what order we needed to order in and even how bad the blood Mary's were there. She didn't check on the food after served and seemed bothered by any questions about the menu. Overall, it was a very bad experience not necessarily because of the food but because of Aubrey.  Although we looked young, everyone at that table makes 6 figures a year with platinum Amex cards as you saw. Don't do that...be mean, judgmental and arrogant. You were officially the lowest tip I have left in the last 20 years. Flemings you deserve and have better servers. Please know that Aubrey is not representing the brand or the chandler restaurant well at all.
