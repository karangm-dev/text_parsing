I wish I read the reviews on this place earlier, because most of the reviews are about poor customer service and it's true. I was here earlier looking at civics (CPO/new) for about 19k out the door. At first the salesman greeted us and helped us, but told us that our budget was too low. That's all fine and dandy, we left, only to be stopped by the manager (Tony) who tried to work with us. We went inside again to see what he can do for us since he's the manger. He listed several options for us, but we already knew what we wanted and none of the options he gave us were up to our standards. Once we stated our disinterest in the options, he was very rude about it. Saying "Whatever" to what we wanted in a civic. At that point I wanted to leave, I have a lot of patience and tolerance with people since I work in customer service for over 10 years. I stayed and gave him another chance because he could have more options for us. We checked KBB to see what's a fair price for a used Honda Civic and we didn't like what he was offering to us. Which is fine, we could've looked somewhere else. But once we mentioned that we would look somewhere else, he belittled us about using KBB. I am baffled at how this guy is in sales/customer service and who is the manager. They really don't care about you or your business. Please Honda, get a new manager instead of Tony. Your dealership deserves better, and it can all happen with better customer service and without Tony.
