Had planned to have a late nite dinner with my daughter weeks before my trip to Vegas...glad we decided on this spot! The ambience was amazing; service was excellent and the food was "slapyourmomma" it's so good kinda food!  Also, we had one of the best strawberry mojitos*pane cattle* ever!! 5 stars all around!! What a great experience!!
