As a Mexican born and raised in California I'm sorry this place was horrible!! The chili had a strange taste !! We just threw it away! And bought hamburgers from B K and that says a lot!! Don't waste your time!!! It could have been an off day for them!! Anyways as we ordered through the Drive thru I was practically yelling thinking Omgosh really!! Never again!! If you try it let me know if you like it ok lol
