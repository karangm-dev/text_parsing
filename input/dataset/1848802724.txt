Wow what wonderful food we had at Omai last weekend. I'm still dreaming of the tamago temaki with truffle... excellent service, very friendly staff, menu worth making a huge detour for (we came down from Montreal lol) it's obvious each item on the menu was thought about and balanced in textured and flavours. I would definitely return next time I'm in TO.
