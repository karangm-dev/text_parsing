I love this place, such a gem!  I have been by it so often when getting my eyelashes done and always wanted to stop in.  Finally, my boyfriend and I stopped in and I wish I would have done it sooner.  It was SO GOOD!  I even convinced my family to drive out from Chandler and they were raving about how good it was.  Right now, I am trying to get my boyfriends butt moving faster so I can fulfill my Italian craving lol.  I will be a regular!  Who am I?  I am a total foodie, who has had the privilege to travel the world and eat at small gems!  I have had the luxury of eating at stalls in hawker centers in Singapore to Three Star Michelin restaurants, like Guy Savoy in Paris.  I have also been all around Italy and ate at the non-tourist gems.  This reminded me of being back in Italy!
