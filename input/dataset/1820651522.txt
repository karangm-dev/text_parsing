First off let me start with I had high hopes for this place. They have great prices if you are looking to buy equipment or shoot at their indoor range. However, where this place falls short is customer service. If you are not in their group of guys better well forget any help at all. I brought my bow in for tuning and to have fun at the range. However, I was dismissed when one of the guys came in and my tune was put on halt until bros problem was fixed I then left without my bow and was told to call later that day. When I called I was told that they were busy and that "I'm in the middle of something." When I asked how my tuning was coming along I then preceded to ask when I can pick up my equipment and to that I was told when I'm finished. This was very rude and unacceptable when you are speaking to a customer who is just asking a simple question. Two days later my "basic" tune was complete and I took to shooting at their range just to me pushed out once one of the bros came in. I do not think I will be coming back and advise the owner to take a look into the close nit community of bros that has to be affecting business if all new customers are treated the same as I was the last few days.
