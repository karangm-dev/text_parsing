I was a patient there for several years. They have a couple great doctors who deserve better. I finally gave up when about 9 months ago I asked the nurse to fill out a life insurance underwriting form. She insisted I had to have another physical which I had already had about 1 year prior. I said I don't think I need one since the underwriter sent people to take their own tests. She asked me to hold then put me on with nurse Rude - I so wish I knew her name. She was awful! She began by saying I understand you don't want to take a physical. Huh? None of that was in the conversation. She was one of the least personable people I have spoken to. After explaining time and time again that the underwriter sent their own people to take tests and I did not need another physical she said fine I will fill out the paper work. Guess what, you are right, she never filled it out nor sent it in. I found out about 3 months later that I was still without life insurance. I left this group in the summer, found a new doctor and they helped me finalize the information in 1 month. I wish Doc Mike had better help. He was great however the staff was all about getting money and requiring unnecessary examines. The nurse I spoke to is one of the most rude and disrespectful people I have dealt with in all long time. I wish there were someone I could have talked to about her, it's tough when the person in charge is the rude one. For the record Doc Mike is great, they just need better management.
