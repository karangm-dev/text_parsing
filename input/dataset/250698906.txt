Service from our trip was pretty bad in my opinion. We had the older lady but she seemed relatively unattentive to our needs. We said we were ready to order and she disappeared for a long time. We asked her to take a picture and she said her hand shakes too much and that she would send someone by... never happened. We had to ask for chip refills but the salsa didn't get refilled. I kind of think those go hand in hand...but maybe I'm just too demanding for a Mexican restaurant haha! My food in particular was disappointing. We work nearby so this is one of those nostalgic places that we always come to. I think $30 for a pitcher of watered down margarita is a ripoff. It is also relatively annoying to be looking for your server and seeing her eating while we are waiting for her. If you have a group of nine, it makes sense to clarify if the tab will be split right? Not hand us a $200 bill and expect us to figure it out with 9 credit cards and the bill not separated. I had to write names next to orders to get her to split it correctly. Needless to say, that took a ridiculous time to sort out.I get it, it is a mom & pops kind of a place...
