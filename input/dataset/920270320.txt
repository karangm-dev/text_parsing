Not an honest place. I was on a work trip and rented a car for 5 days. That part was fine. Upon return I accidentally left my iPhone in the console of the vehicle. I made it all the way through security at the airport before realizing I left it. I tried to use a payphone to call the location but no one picked up the phone, so I got back on the shuttle and went to the rental center. I gave them my receipt so they could find the car but after waiting 30 minutes I had to leave to get on my flight home. I left a photocopy of my receipt, my work phone number, and my address. The manager on duty assured me they would search for the car and look for the phone. "Wanda" was supposedly the searcher. As soon as I got home I reported the iPhone lost in their web system. I waited all day the next day for a call from Hertz, nothing. The car was returned on a Thursday and I didn't hear ANYTHING until sending a follow up email MONDAY, after I finally received an email from someone saying they re-rented the car the same day and would check it when it was returned. No explanation of why it was re-rented when I reported IN PERSON that my phone was left behind. I was in the Hertz rental center no more than an hour after I returned the vehicle. Whether the cleaner of the vehicle or the next customer STOLE my phone doesn't matter. These people lied to me about what they were going to do. They never followed up. They are dishonest and I will never rent from Hertz ever again. Terrible customer service and not honest.
