We scheduled Matt to clean out our dryer vent after hearing good reviews on Next Door.  He was on time; very pleasant and explained every step he was going to do to clean out our vent. He cleaned it from the roof and from the dryer side.  He explained that our vent was actually in good shape but he did collect some lint/garbage out of the vent line. While he was on the roof he checked for any loose or cracked tiles!  I would definately use Northstar again for this service.  The price he charged ($69) is a great price for all he does.
