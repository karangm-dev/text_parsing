Don't get the Bronzino. It is good but when all the tail and skin is removed , it only came out to about 2 0unces of actual meat. For $29, not worth it. Also was served with potatoes that were just diced up potatoes and no sauce or anything. Very bland. The service wasn't good either. Took them almost an hour and a half to bring out our food. Had to remind server to bring our side of brussel sprouts Which turned out raw and hard. Couldn't even eat them. We weren't drinking byob so every minute was torture. Wouldn't go back... They are really good at wording the menu to sound like their food is unique and something you'll never find anywhere else. Such a let down when you actually taste it. Bland and unimpressive
