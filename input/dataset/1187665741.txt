Is it Mexican food? Chinese? Jamaican?! No one knows!!! Try this place! Don't know how someone put these together, but man is it good stuff.Laid back atmosphere, (you'll be sitting on plastic chairs and dining on the finest "Lifetime" folding tables Costco can supply!) The food is freshly prepared and goes from mild to spicy! I usually get the jerk chicken, but last time...last time, I got the machaca. There's no going back now. It was on point and yes, a bit on the spicy side. Much spice. Very wow. So flavor.  I've been here 4 or 5 times now and I still don't know how to fill out their counter card. The staff is nice but they kinda just fill out your card to expedite the process and push you along. Just go with the flow and you'll be fine. Also, tried the watermelon tea last time. Delicious.
