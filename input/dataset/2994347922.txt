I love this place! I started my Bootcamp workout here, 2 weeks ago, and already I lost 8lbs. I bought another weighing scale just to double check, lol!! Well because i can't believe it! I came almost everyday & I love all the coaches! Everyone come here with the same mission & goals, so this really help you to keep motivated! The meals plan for weight loss that my coach gave me really worked & I really felt amazing!
