Okay I finally created a yelp account and this restaurant was my motivation. Everything about this place was great. The server was kind and even recommended her favorite dishes. The bread they brought out was amazing (3 different kinds).I got the soufflé as an appetizer. The ahi tuna as an entrée and the spoon bar as a desert. It was all amazing. I would definitely recommend the ahi tuna to anyone (got it sushi rare).
