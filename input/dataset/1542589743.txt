Went here after going to ride the High Roller. My husband and I thought the food would be better from watching Guy Fieri on Food Network. We weren't too hungry so we thought we could order a couple of appetizers and we'd be fine. There's only three or four items on their appetizer section. I ended up ordering the Greek salad and he ordered the wings. The lollipop wings are a joke, not much meat and certainly not shareable. There aren't too many wings to begin with and they charge a lot for them. For the price, I would think you would be served a little more. Looking at other tables their burgers and fries look like larger portions. My $16 salad was mediocre. Will not return. This place is like a Hooters, catered to men as the waitresses are walking around in mini skirts and low cut tops and tv screens everywhere with sports games on. The restaurant is decorated in a saloon/sports bar type ambience, loved the skull napkins.
