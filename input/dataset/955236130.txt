I did not eat here, to preface. I came for a few drinks with my best girlfriends to have a good time. What I encountered was absolutely disgusting.A patron at the bar who was intoxicated (possibly and probably drugged) was dancing aggressively on the dance floor -- taking off her shirt and grinding on the ground. A friend of our group went to help her with a bartender while we witnessed a male patron videotaping her. Horrified by this behavior, another friend of our group went to stop it. After being told that women want to be taped and treated like objects, as well as being called a bitch, we chose to ignore and try to have a good time. Meanwhile, we were informed by our friend (who is a health professional) that the painted lady REFUSED to call 911 for the girl and told our friend she was too drunk to make that decision,When we decided to leave, we gathered out things and put on our jackets...as we went to walk out, the same jerk that taped the woman (rather than helping her) stared at my friends chest...to which she responded with a middle finger. That was followed by his friend telling my friend his guy really wanted to f**k her. All women want that right?!I am beyond disgusted by the behaviors displayed at the painted lady tonight. We are all human beings and deserved to be treated as such.Will never visit this establishment AGAIN!
