I'm going to give 2 stars since it was a takeout order.  I ordered the classic Reuben and the Jameson bread pudding as a treat to celebrate my Marine Corps' birthday. Well, the sandwich had a tsp of dressing, no pickle, & semi stale house chips.  The only thing that will make me give it a second try is dining in and a pint of Mangers.
