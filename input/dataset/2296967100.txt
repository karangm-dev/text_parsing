Great food great service. My wife and I had breakfast here over the weekend - coffee arrived at the table in record time and breakfast followed soon after. The portions for "the bunker" (corn beef hash) are large enough that we each had a midmorning snack later in the day.We've been in a number of times over the years and I've always been glad that we've stopped.
