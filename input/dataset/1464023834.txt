This place rules.  My friend and I took a bus from downtown to check it out.  It was a little hard to find, since it's a very nondescript building but it's across the street from the Liberace museum, more or less.The games are very, very affordable, which is awesome.  There are games from throughout the history of pinball, back to even when there were no flippers and you just watched the ball do its thing.  You really can't go wrong with this amazing establishment.  It's a ton of fun to try the different machines and experience pinball from various decades.  There is a great selection of video games too, plus weird old mechanical games such as baseball, including one where you use an air pump or something to propel a ball into the air and try to hit it with a mechanical doll.  Hilarious!!Highly recommended.
