My favorite place for Thai food! There are so many delicious options, and the prices are relatively low. I've grabbed food from here with a number of friends over the years, and they're all fans, as well. I'm really glad it's close to home and located in such a convenient area. While waiting for takeoutー it surprisingly never takes long, which I find pretty impresssiveー I can go do quick errands like shopping at the dollar store, hitting up Starbucks, and so on.My favorite things to order at this restaurant are definitely the massaman curry, the pad thai, and the Thai toast. The food always comes out hot, and the portion sizes are generous. I guess the only complaint I have is that while the food is always fantastic overall, there are flavor inconsistencies at times. Sometimes they make dishes sweeter, spicier, more sour, etc. than expected/"normal." Noticeable differences, but usually nothing to get too miffed about.
