I went in to sell 3 nice old pieces of clothing. They told me after a few hours that they were too stocked up on those specific types of garments. I was asked if I would like to "donate" them instead. To which I asked where they will be donated. She said the salvation army, with her arms crossed, looking me straight in the eye (both obvious signs of defense and lying) . I gave her the thumbs up shot a smile and left. I don't really trust themNot sure, but I feel like they are shady and maybe corrupt. I will probably never go there again. My clothes are actually going to the salvation army next time.
