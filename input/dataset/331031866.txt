Went to there order corner near the salad bar buffet. Couldn't seem to get service and then when I did it seemed to be rushing me and myself being vegan was along what the potatoes where in as far as oil or what we goes and the guy behind the counter was very rude!  Needless to say I won't be returning to this place! They seemed to be put off me asking question about the food I was about to consume and BUY!
