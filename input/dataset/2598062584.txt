What a racket. This is everything that is wrong with economies of scale. -You will spend excessive amounts of time on hold.-You may never actually speak to a doctor. Good luck even getting to a PA.-Everyone you do get a hold of on the phone will pass the buck and transfer you to another department.-No one takes any personal responsibility. It is always someone else's job or it's just the way the system works, etc.-After "urgently" ordering me to rush in for an MRI and collecting their $$, it was damn near impossible to get service from TOCA. Working with TOCA has led to nothing but half-baked information and a HUGE hassle.Too big for their own good. You will feel like a commodity and not a patient.
