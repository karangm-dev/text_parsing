Seriously, all these 5-star reviews are on point. Tucked away in a shopping center, I am so glad that I happened upon this place first for a cut, then for a drastic dye and cut. Brandi is super, super friendly and very skilled in what she does. She'll be honest about how things look instead of just agreeing to whatever, which I 110% appreciate.My first visit, I chopped off quite a bit of hair. Need change sometimes! I showed her a couple of pictures I found and, although they were pathetically small, she understood what I wanted and improved on it! I loved my hair - it was also a great bonus that she thinned it out for the hot summer months. My hair is THICK.My second visit was a bit more drastic. I've been fiending for a color in my hair for quite some time - box red wasn't cutting it anymore. I waited a couple of months after my box dye and sprang right in here on a Saturday. (I got really, really lucky with a same-day appointment. Call ahead!)While since then I've had to change my hair due to a career change, I wish I could go back to it and would 100% recommend Brandi for anyone else wanting to do anything like that as well.
