The first time I ate at a Fazoli's, I was blown away. They had great sandwiches, good pasta, and a solid business model.  One of my favorite things to do when I was young and poor was to go to Fazoli's to do homework.  I would have lunch, then sit there all afternoon refilling my drink cup and saying "HIt me again" to the girl who came around with the basket of breadsticks every  fifteen minutes.  By the time I was done with my studying, I would be so full of breadsticks that I didn't need dinner.  Fazoli's helped me through college and grad school.  Since those days (many years ago, sadly), they've gone downhill faster than a Red Zephyr wagon with two fat kids in it.  They tinker needlessly with the menu.  Their food has gotten tasteless. And for a time, you had to go ask for the breadsticks instead of having them brought to you.  I used to love their food.  Now, it's just okay. Mediocre, really.  I no longer look forward to going to Fazoli's.  What once used to be a weekly thing when I was younger has become a once, maybe twice yearly thing.  And each time I go back, I remember what used to be and swear that I'll never return.  But those breadsticks--they're like crack, man.
