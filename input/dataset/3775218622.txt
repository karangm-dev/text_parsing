This place is great!  I was in Vegas for a very typical reason (bachelorette party..wooohooo!) and I ended up chipping my front tooth on the very first night there!  :(  Luckily one of the girls in the party was local and recommended that I go to Floss Dental.  From the moment I walked in to the moment I left, I was incredibly happy with the service and care that went into my treatment.  Of course I was very upset that my front tooth chipped (I looked like a pirate!) and I wanted to leave looking normal.  Dr. Tounian was very patient and very kind.  He took the time to explain the treatment needed (luckily just a filling) and made everything completely painless.  Not only that, but the filling matches perfectly and feels great.  Thank you Dr. Tounian!  His partner Dr. Tran was very nice as well..  and ladies, both of them are easy on the eyes too!
