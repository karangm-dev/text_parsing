Clean rooms with coffee pot and empty mini fridge...( I liked that. We added our own water bottles and sodas instead of using a fully stocked expensive mini fridge), SUPER nice friendly staff, tasty restraunt, comfortable sitting areas in lobby and coffee, tea, cold water and snack table was a nice touch..will definitely stay there again!Small pool but wasn't planning on using it.
