Just had our family dinner here with huge party of 20 people and they were very accommodating. The food was excellent... Everything was fresh and delicious! Our servers, Debbie and Coop, were very attentive to our huge group and were simply the best! We enjoyed our dinner here and can highly recommend this establishment to everyone!
