Disclaimer...my food was a delivery order. I had heard mixed reviews and opted to try it. Lack of flavor....added some salt to get some of it down...hey I was hungry with no other option at that point and it was my lunch break! Enchiladas were a bit more greasy than expected - rice and beans had really no flavor.Menu is basic Mexican food. Lots of bar type appetizer options.Others who ordered with me said fish tacos are great, quesadillas were basic. Probably won't return.
