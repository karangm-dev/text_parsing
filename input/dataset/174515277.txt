The food was good, better quality than most other Asian restaurants we have been to in the area. The service was nothing spectacular. Our waitress came back twice Ina 45 minute visit. The really odd part was the host or the older gentlemen seating people. When they felt you should be done, they made it very obvious that they would prefer that you move on and free up a booth. That made for a very rushed and uncomfortable date night for parents of four kids that rarely get to go out alone.
