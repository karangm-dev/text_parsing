We called to see if the restaurant had tables and the guy that answered said we could come any time as they had plenty of openings and we went ahead and made a reservation.When we got there we were told it was only outside (which was too hot and humid).  Somebody went to get the owner, another waiter came by and rudely & loudly told the owner in front of us that we had to sit outside. The owner said "I got nothing"I understand that Dolce is a neighborhood gem and we've eaten there before & have been satisfied.  Maybe if it was a real patio & not a plastic enclosed oven we would have taken outside. but with that experience...I doubt they care, but we won't be back & won't recommend it.
