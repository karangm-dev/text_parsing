Found this place on Yelp with good reviews.  First time customer and I brought my sister-in law with me. She wanted a gel mani but they "up-sale" her to the SNS product mani.  She liked the finished product until the guy touched  her nails to check for dryness and messed one. She is not happy!  Now, she is sitting in the chair again to fix her nails. Not a good "first impression" and may not be back.
