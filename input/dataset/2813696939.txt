So Fox Sports Grill has become The Canyon Grill....new concept with live music venue, same very very disappointing food. An upscale looking place in an upscale location should serve at least half way upscale food.....I would rather eat at Chili's . It is too bad because the ambiance and viewing options are great. PLEASE change the menu, change the food quality, change the chef.
