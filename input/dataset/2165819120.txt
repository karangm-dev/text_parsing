We went there on a friday night, the whole place was jam packed. We were able to find a table and we ordered our food. We ordered a nachos platter as an entr√©e, and we got the 4 chicken taco build-your-own (18$) and 3 hard shell tacos with rice (8$) First of all the nachos platter was very disappointing, almost no cheese, no salsa on the chips and barely any toppings. Plate came quite hot at least. Then maybe 40min later came our main course, my hard shell tacos were ok but my friend complained that his chicken was under-cooked and mediocre. This place is way overpriced for what you get and the service is very average.
