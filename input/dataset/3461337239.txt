This place is one-of-a-kind!! The atmosphere was romantic, with low levels of noise. And the lights were turned down low. We were seated quickly, after a short wait during dinner rush. Our wait staff was helpful and attentive to our needs. It was my first visit, so there were explanations to get my expectations adjusted for how it works. The menus are posted around the room walls and are simple to see/understand. The cuisine is much like you would expect for an Italian kitchen. All entrees are served to the table with your choice of wine (red or white) kept at the table, in carafes.  Our food came quickly, but not before a round of bread that was toasted and buttered and smothered in garlic. I can't be sure, but the bread may have been delivered straight from Heaven. A side salad or soup is offered while waiting for dinner. The salad was a garden variety with Italian dressing. It wasn't large, but it went well with the bread and wine. The portions were quite satisfying. I was able to eat all of my Lasagna, and I was happy to walk from the restaurant to The Strip for an after-dinner show. The lasagna was served with a meat sauce and covered with a thin layer of cheese and baked to perfection. I can definitely recommend this place and will definitely be returning.
