I love Henry I'm so glad i was referred to him. I do not go to anyone else for my hands. Last time i did and you say hi to Henry one of the girls was mocking me as i said hello to him while she was working on my nails. When ever she did my nails (SNS powder) they chipped at least 3 times in less than 2 weeks when they normally last me 3 weeks when Henry does them. So after all of that i will never go to anyone but Henry when it comes to my hands. You can easily hide your feet but not your hands.
