One of the WORST, WORST experience I've had with a company.. Called and spoke w/ Callie 1st thing I asked was "do you do free estimate..?" She said yes so went ahead and explain the issue and set the appt... When the service guy came thur said it's was going to be about 260, told him okay thanks let me think about it.. That's when he said there's a 65 service charge, and would get in trouble if he didn't collect the fee.. So pretty much was forced in a corner, so just got it done.. Service guy did knock off the cost, can't blame him he didn't take the call.. When talking to Callie she gave me BS excuse about this "service fee".. Just a total headache, avoid this company!!!!
