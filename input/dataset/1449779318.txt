4.5 starsI'm not sure why the pizza tastes so much better in Madison then it does in other cities where I've had pizza (mainly on the  West Coast),  there must be something in the air. They have some interesting options for specialty pizzas but I'm not a huge fan of greasy fatty foods so I've only tried the  Fetalicious, Thai ,Deluxe, BBQ, and Mediteranean all which were great. They have some great deals online and delivery is free! Pizza from here is never disappointing and whenever I ask for extra sauce, less cheese, or well done they always accomodate. They aren't as cheap as dominos or papa johns but they also dont skimp on toppings and I've never had a problem with their delivery. They have some other options on their menu besides pizza, I've only tried their spinich cheese bread and their crispy chicken and fries both which were super tasty. I've never been disappointed with the food or the service here so I would definitely recommend this place.
