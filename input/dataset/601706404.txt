The WORST Best Buy out there!!!!! And trust me I've shopped at Arizona and Texas locations. Those so called employees of theirs spend more time standing around socializing amongst themselves then they do helping customers. When you ask them to look something up they get back to you with false information.  But the worst of them all is their management team.  I've witnessed a manager rudely smart mouthing off to a female customer in front of a bunch of other customers while the other employee stood by and laughed at the whole thing.  Who hires and trains these assholes?? This type of unprofessionalism reflects on the general manager of the store.  So many other competitor stores to chose from who actually would be glad to help. Why give your business to this store full of unfit employees to say the least.
