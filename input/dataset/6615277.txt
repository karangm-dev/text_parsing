I just walked in an hour after the posted opening time.  I'm not sure if the buffet is still an option, because there was no food on the buffet. I considered placing an order.  A woman came from the back,  but appeared to be on her phone.  For the 2 minutes I stood at the counter she never approached me or asked me if she could help.  I walked out and went to Chan An in the same complex. I was greeted at Chan An immediately and with a smile.
