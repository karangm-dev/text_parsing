I used to work directly across the street from Ferraro so during the work week, I ended up here 3 out of 5 days.  This lead me to utilizing the restaurant as a last minute dinner spot as well.For lunch, opt for the Griglia con Pollo salad.  I don't know what type of dressing they use but it is light and delicious.  The chicken is juicy, tender and falls apart in your mouth.  And the bread... oh the bread.  Warm, freshly baked bread makes my heart go pitter pat.The wine list is good and there's a lot of variety so finding a bottle to accompany your dinner is a breeze.  You may find that the wine goes down too well here.  At least, I've found that... on more than one occasion.
