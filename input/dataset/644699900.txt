Update!!If I could rate below zero, I would. This place officially gets -11 in my mind. The day after I got my pedicure, the bottom of my left foot got really itchy. It had progressively gotten worse and appears as though I caught something (probably a fungus according to my doctor) from the tools used at this salon. Beware.
