The breakfast sandwich was good but had to wait far too long to get it. When I asked for a cup of WATER the person at the sandwich delivery counter said "WE ONLY HAVE BOTTLED WATER HERE"!! REALLY? What kind of food service facility would ask you to choke your food down or pay outrageous prices for bottled water? Only the SLUTTY KIND!
