The only reason I'm a repeat customer is because the beer is ridiculously cheap. Do NOT eat the food. I've had a handful of friends fall ill after eating there and I've personally witnessed kitchen staff use the bathroom and walk out without washing their hands. (not to say they didn't wash them once they got back upstairs, just sayin)Go for the beer, stay for the patio.
