I've been to other Sam Woo restaurants in California. This one is similar with the exception of one thing: Price. It's very overpriced here compared to other locations. It might be due to the location..but not 100% sure why everything cost almost double compared to other places... They even charge for white steamed rice.Service here is mediocre. They tend to have a bad attitude and are not very customer oriented.Other than that: Food is okay. What you would expect from Sam Woo. Roasted BBQ like duck and pork is good. Other stuff is okay. Green onion beef is good. Tofu dishes are generally good as well. The fried chicken wing was meh. It just wasn't seasoned very well.Overall, I wouldn't recommend coming here, but my family always likes coming here when visiting Vegas. There are tons of other choices in the area for Asian food. Yelp those places up before coming here!
