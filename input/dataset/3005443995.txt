This is the worst location, Chic Fil A is known for quick efficient customer service and their politeness. This location is very slow at the drive through which is disappointing since it's closest to my home. Teenagers work here and appear to have a hard time getting orders correct at the drive thru and moving the line. Do better, not living up to the reputation of this restaurant.
