Dear Zipcar Toronto, Thank you for winning my worst lifetime customer experience besides Sears and CapitalOne. They harassed me at least 5 times on a yearly basis to rentals I had, and trying deeply hard to take money from your pocket for fault not made by myself but other Zipsters / strangers. If you eventually find sufficient proof to show them you are innocent and upset, then they gave you a verbal sorry and that is it, easy than anything. And expect harassments and taking more and more money from your credit card account without giving you sufficent proof. You want to fight for it? It took days, your patience, and your mood as well.Overall their nonprofessional practices and sneaky customer experience have outweighed the convenience they provided. To me they are more like a scam or a drug now, it does me more financial harm in long term. I am planning to report them to BBB currently.My friends, I can write tons of my sad AND  true stories honored by Zipcar but I decided just not to use it in my life(Even their cancellation takes time, haha.). Get over it.PS: Ask me personally if you really want to hear my stories regarding to dents, dings, floods, and even collisions not made by myself.LeonZipcar Member Number: 2296963
