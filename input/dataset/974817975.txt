I would love to tell you all about their gelato. However, they really have no order system or any sort of line that you wait in. You are just supposed to rush the counter and I guess it's first come first serve. Worked my way to the front with my 4 year old in tow. I started to place my order once one of the terrified overwhelmed servers attempted to make eye contact. I was interrupted by an impatient woman demanding free samples of the strawberry. This repeated itself 3 more times, as my order was interrupted and not filled...and I finally realized I was wasting my time. My son and I left and walked next door to Cream and were served in half the time with none of the confusion. Note to management: Invest a few bucks in a couple of cones and make a line? Stop wasting everyone's time. You make it impossible for your staff to manage your customers efficiently. I'm not interested in getting into a mosh pit or screaming match to order gelato. I do not care how tasty it supposedly is....And BTW, I was trying to place and order that I was actually paying for, only to get over run by people trying to feed their families of 6 entirely with FREE SAMPLES. The best part is, that while waiting in line at your competitor, several people behind me were openly complaining about the same issue I had with this establishment and opted to also take their money elsewhere. Hopefully management learns and makes the necessary changes, otherwise we will not be back.
