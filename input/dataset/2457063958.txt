Everything was great up until the polish ( I mostly go get a Pedi for the leg and foot rub) which looked pretty crappy with paint on my hand. I mean really bad.... my daughter's was even worse. They said hers was dry and it was basically ruined 10 minutes after we left. We definitely felt rushed at the beginning and end. Won't go back.
