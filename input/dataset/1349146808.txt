Mohave air replaced our heating and air conditioning systems. Since completing the job they have had to come two more times. The first time because they didn't charge the new system properly and we couldn't get the house below 80 degrees. The second because one of the condensation lines became unattached because it wasn't ever glued and vibrated loose. Once it detached it flooded our attic and leaked down into ceiling and now we are trying to match the paint to put this behind. Not happy with the job done.
