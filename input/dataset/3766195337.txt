Cab driver started off unfriendly and did not want to take a credit card once I arrived at my destination.  Every card I own was somehow declined until he extorted cash from me so I could leave the car.  Funny I had no problems with the cards anywhere else before or after. You guys wonder why everyone is switching to Uber???   Beware of Car #476!
