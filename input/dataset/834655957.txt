I think the interior decoration of this cafe is really cute but the amount of seats is way lesser than it is in pictures. I ordered a latte and it was average. Their ordering system is very confusing. I came here on a Tuesday around 12/1pm and it was the worst idea ever. The line was extremely long because it was lunch hour. The service wasn't great. When I told the girl I only want a coffee, she seemed really annoyed about it and redirect me to the cashier. Didn't say thank you or make eye contact with me. It's like I was bothering her from taking lunch orders. I hope they improve their customer service soon because it's ruining how cute the cafe actually is smmhhhhh.....
