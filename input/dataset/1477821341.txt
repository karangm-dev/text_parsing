What am I missing???We came here three times on our last visit to Vegas.  THREE!  Because the kids in our party were mesmerized by the sugar and the bling.  Okay, I get it.  In the marketing to kids department: 5 Stars.  And not just kids... I am the proud owner of a pink rhinestone duck keychain that probably cost $0.50 to make, and cost $15 to purchase... Note: two rhinestones are already missing.So the first time we went, we had a party of 20 (with a reservation).  It took them 45 minutes past our reservation time to seat us... and we weren't near each other.  It took an hour(!!!) for our food.  The kids were going crazy, they were starving.  POOR organization (with many apologies from our servers, who were polite).None of the food is great.  It's all okay.  Not bad.  The portions are ridiculous... The frozen hot chocolates taste powdery and I can't recommend them.  I had a scoop of ice cream, which was about three giant scoops... TOO MUCH FOOD!  The waste that happens there is out of control.  The gummy cherries that they put on their sundaes were stale on all three occasions.  And I love gummy cherries!Anyway, mediocre food, overpriced candy and accessories, poorly executed for large parties, lengthy waits for food, excess and waste.  At least the staff is nice.
