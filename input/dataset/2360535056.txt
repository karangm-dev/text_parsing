Do not use Pauls Pest Control. Pauls Pest Control treated my entire  entire home when my floor installer found termites as they were putting my hardwood floors down. A year later, I had termite damage on my new wood floors. Pauls guys treated those areas but the termites came back in a few months in the same area. I also saw termites on my front door. Pauls men came over and treated the floors in two small areas but wouldn't treat my front door because my husband sprayed the door with Raid. I pleaded with them, but they said no. A month or so later, Termites came back on the floors. I called Paul and he came over to take a look. He PROMISED that he would come up with a plan to treat my house to get rid of the termites. Paul NEVER called me back with a plan. Now, my front door is ruined with several termite tubes and the wood on my door is splitting. My floors are showing more signs of termites. Beware of this company.
