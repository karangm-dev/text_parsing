Worst MAC location ever!!! After repeated attempts and fails I am no longer returning to this MAC even though it is the closest to my house... I am even considering switching my holy grail eyeliner to another brand entirely as the people who work MAC counters generally look like street walkers (and not in a good way- if there is a good way!)- not edgy, like I think they are going for! They are lazy and you have to go over to them and get in their face to get them to help you and basically hand them the product. And then they don't even say 'hi' or ask 'how are you?'- you know, the bare minimum that is to be expected in ANY human intereaction- let alone a customer service interaction at a retailer where they want my money!  I used to spend tons at MAC and now I have moved on to more luxurious things and better service at the Chanel counter... though definitely not at this Dillards- the customer service is atrocious all over at this mall! I really don't know how some of these people have jobs.  Sorry if some of my reviews seem harsh lately, but I am no longer standing for this kind of crap service.
