This place is amazing.  We came in on a whim for Friday night date night.  We ordered the stuffed mushrooms and kicking shrimp appetizers, along with the oysters.  All three were amazing.  After apps we split the Chipotle salmon, which was amazing.  No desserts though, because we were stuffed by then.  Service was attentive, atmosphere was a little loud, but not too bad for a busy Friday night.  Overall a great experience!
