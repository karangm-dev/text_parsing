My son works two jobs and saved up to be able to take me to the Diamondbacks game for Mother's day because they were giving out clutch purses to the first 10,000 MOMS, I would not have a problem with it if they had said the first 10,000 people or the first 10,000 females but it specifically said "MOMS"...I am very disappointed that the purses were gone more than an hour and a half before the game started particularly when I saw a lot of pre-teens and other very young girls with the gift. When you do a promotion for a specific group of people, you need to either honor that group or don't do anything at all. :-(
