We have had a wonderful experience with Dr. Beals treating our son. He's been seeing him for about 8 months now and are very satisfied with the care he receives here. Dr. Beals is very helpful, we never feel rushed to get out of his office and he's patient in answering our questions. One of the things I most appreciate is that I've never felt like his solution is to throw a bunch of meds at my son. He's conservative and has started on low doses, moving up only when we were comfortable. My son loves coming to the appointments and playing with all the Minecraft toys in his office!
