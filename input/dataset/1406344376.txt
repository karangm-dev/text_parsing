I just spent an evening with food poisining. I had the soup/salad/cornbread combo. Soup was carrot lime. Salad was edamame. I'm a musician and this was my pre-show meal. I thought I was doing something good for myself. Turns out something in the ingredients was bad or dirty. I had to bow out of the show. Just thought if let everyone know. Might not be so "fresh" at FRESH.
