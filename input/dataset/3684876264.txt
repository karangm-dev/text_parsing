We went here with a $25 certificate from restaurant.com and this place is amazing, I have been back twice since we first tried it a week prior. We had the Cubano Sliders, the Empanadas, the Pernil Asado tacos, the Short Rib Barbacoa tacos and the Carne Asada tacos. Hands down, my absolute favorite dish would have to have been the Cubano sliders, rolls filed with ham(real ham, not lunchmeat), pulled pork, swiss, dijon mustard( which tastes like it has horseradish in it, very strong so be warned) and served with a slide of fantastic sweet potato fries, by far the best sweet potato fries I have had in a long time. The Empanadas were savory and delicious, the best kind of empanada is one filled with meat.  The Pernil Asado, was my favorite of the three tacos we tried, not spicy like the short rib, but juicy, sweet and savory. The Short Rib was delicious as well, but spicy, the lingering kind of spicy, so be prepared. I was told that this place was considered "mexican food" but from experiencing even just the appetizers I would say it's way more Cuban than Mexican.
