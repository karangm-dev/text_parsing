I was referred to Arrow by my brother in law as my minivan needed work done and I was frustrated by my usual mechanics both by their lack of specificity of the problem and the price.  Arrow displayed insanely superior customer service in so far that they gave me a detailed explanation as to the issue, how they were going to fix it, how long it would take and the estimated cost.  The work was done same day and I couldn't be happier.  I highly recommend this business to anyone.
