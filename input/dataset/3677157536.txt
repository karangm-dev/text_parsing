This is definitely more of a "Hawaiian-theme" restaurant and not a true Hawaiian BBQ place. It was disappointing. Their menu neglects to include Hawaiian staples -like loco moco and manapua. We ordered the Kalbi short ribs - it was hardly edible, the pieces were so fatty. The Kalua pork was decent, but extremely salty. The best was the chicken Katsu, which honestly was pretty decent. It's unfortunate that this is the closest Hawaiian restaurant within 30 minutes of us...
