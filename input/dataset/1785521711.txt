Holly Molly this place is so good it's worth every penny. We found this place by accident on a trip to Vegas and not wanting another buffet.  We ordered the Special that comes with King crab,  Snow crab ( we added this to the special) , shrimp, muscles, and clams.  It's a bit pricey but the flavor and the amount of food you get is a good deal and enough for two hungry adults.  Everything from the potatoes, to the corn, and the crabs it's all full of flavor.  The restaurant is very clean and the bathrooms not bad at all.  Customer service always goes a long way with me and the staff here has always been really friendly (all three times i have been to this place).  We will definitely be back every time we come to Vegas.
