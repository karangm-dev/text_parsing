I took my (superb) daughter out for an evening snack tonight and happened upon this brand new Vietnamese noodle place.  Thinking to myself, it's hard to differentiate pho in this city, expectations were "stable". A few minutes in, our host, Jessica, and her talented chef brother (Crap! I failed to get his name!) made us feel like we'd popped by their own home for dinner. Food comes quickly, tastes great and won't hurt you, financially.  This was one of the coolest dining experiences we've had in a long while (and admittedly we dine out a fair bit.)You should eat here...often. We will.
