I really wanted to give this place more stars however.........Staff was very friendly and personable (hence the 1 star). Our food took a bit over 20 minutes just to come out cold. Seriously the butter never melted on the waffle - never. The gravy was cold- not hot, not cool but cold! The cornbread was dry and I'm sure cardboard would have been more tasty. The chicken breast was moist although the batter came off as soon as you cut into it so I basically ate naked fried chicken. Asked for the manager but instead the owner came out. We explained very politely how terrible everything was. He offered to bring something else out and we opted for fresh waffles. I will admit when fresh and hot they are really good. Get the bill and for 2 cold chicken and waffle dinners with 2 soda waters and 1 ginger beer our total was $45..... Hmm the owner did hand us a card for a free appetizer on our next visit. Hmmmm
