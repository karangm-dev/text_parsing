This has been one of the worst customer service experiences I have had with a company. We ordered two blinds and they both were supposed to be bottom-up/ top-down blinds. Both were incorrectly ordered. When we notified the designer she was unresponsive and the store employees were similarly unhelpful. I conservatively left at least 10 messages with poor to little response each time being redirected to the designer who was unresponsive and getting no help from the store. In the end I decided it was not worth it and just kept the incorrectly ordered blind (one was replaced probably because it was a standard size) which I believe was their strategy all along (to avoid having to pay for a new custom-sized blind). They did not even honor their return policy on one of the blinds despite the fact that we followed their archaic fax form procedure. To be fair the blinds seem to be of decent quality and are doing their job. However, be aware that this company does not stand behind their work and does not seem to have a centralized way of managing their 'designers' and as such defer to these salespeople to manage any order problems. So, if you get stuck with a bad designer you may be out of luck if you need any modification whatsoever.
