Service was fine, food was not. Stopped in for brunch and ordered the Deconstructed Taco. Diced chicken, bacon, eggs, pico and jalapenos. The server said it was one of his favs since they added it to the menu. I didn't count it against him since it probably WAS good when he tried it but for me that was not the case. The diced chicken was hard and rubbery, the pico was more like jarred salsa and the food on the outside of the plate wasnt as warm as the food in the middle. The tortillas were heated in the microwave and rolled up so they were hard as hell and trying to unroll them made a cracker crumb mess. I'm not one to send back my food so I just made a note to self not to order it again.
