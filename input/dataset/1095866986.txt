First time here and there seemed to be a bit of a missing selection but nonetheless i came out with some linzer tortes, a creamed horn, and a long john doughnut. Linzer tortes and creamed horn were good but nothing amazing. BUT THAT DOUGHNUT. I savored every bite. I licked the box, dreamt about it, and wish every single day that i had a prantl's doughnut. The cream on top is what dreams are made of. Other than that, the individual cakes looked good but were around $5 each and that didn't make sense for something i could make at home. Goods a bit overpriced but those doughnuts were worth every penny!
