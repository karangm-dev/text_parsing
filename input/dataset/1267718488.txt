Came here with my wife and friends. There is nothing to complain about, I came here twice within the span of about 2 weeks. The first time I got country fried chicken with hash browns and toast. With a side of their coffee cake which is absolutely delish. My entire meal was tasty, everyone liked their breakfast they ordered.The second time I got eggs Benedict, I didn't like it as much, but was still good. Overall, don't pass on the coffee cake. Very solid option for breakfast.
