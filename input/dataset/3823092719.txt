I have had nothing but exceptional experiences at this nail salon. Every time I come in, the staff is welcoming and helpful. The place is spacious and super clean. I usually get a manicure and a pedicure. They will give you water and always lay a towel on your lap if you have a dress on. I've never had a subpar manicure or pedicure here. I always leave satisfied and glad I came! I would highly recommend this place and if you had a less than great experience, give them a second try. It's by far my favorite place to go in this area. Prices are also very reasonable.
