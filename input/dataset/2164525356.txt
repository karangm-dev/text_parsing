I  always check Yelp before I go to a restaurant i like to think the reviews are good. I went to this place and the food was horrible. The only thing that tasted like anything was the crab legs. Then, I had a thought why not give someone a idea, compare the restaurants with something  else so people will really know what is what. I could find better food at a Golden Corral, do  I think their food is bad no, I just think their food is better  and you can spend less money than what I spent in this place. If you are a foodie this is not for you.   One thing must say the staff is nice.
