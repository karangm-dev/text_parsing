Came here with a 2-4-1 MyVegas coupon for brunch so the price was great, but the food was okay and service was spotty at best. Large assortment for brunch, especially for dessert. The sushi before 10am freaked me out so I steered clear. Nothing was all that memorable from this meal except for the poor service (I had to get up and ask the waiters standing around chatting to get a refill on drinks).
