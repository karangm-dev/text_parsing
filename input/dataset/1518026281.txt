This place was amazing. Never got any kind of piercing or anything and they just made my experience a lot less nerve wrecking. Both the ladies there know what they are doing. The lady there was really funny and made me feel comfortable. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to get a piercing. Thanks!
