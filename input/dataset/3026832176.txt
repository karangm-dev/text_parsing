impossible to convey what an absolute inept operation westgate sportsbook presents. the attitude there is surely impacted by the incredible incompetence of management - minor  problems encountered are dealt with total disdain for the customer, rather than even attempting to accomodate. the trickle down of disrespect for the hand that feeds them is attributable to the manager, who revels on  radio talk shows about how well the book succeeds in beating up the players. it is amazing that someone in that positon could be so arrogant and not be noticed by upper level management as being such a dunce. the days of gambling with dignity and honor are long gone in this den of dubious characters!
