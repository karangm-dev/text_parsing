If I could give 0 stars I would. My order was messed up twice (which i was very polite about because the front counter person was new) but the manager Heather was so rude I couldn't believe it. This was truly the worst experience I've ever had at a food place. DO NOT GO HERE!!! The food also was extremely average. Such a shame because I love the other locations, this one is trash because of the staff
