I was in Madison for a weekend event and needed to get my nails done, stat.  Since there aren't many Yelp reviews in Madison, I searched Google and found some decent reviews on VIP so I thought I'd swing by.  Well, it is probably not a good idea for someone from out of town to just go running around Madison.  Let's just say this place is not in the nicest of neighborhoods.  That being said, the patrons are not that nice either.  There are 8x11 "posters" hanging around the place stating "No eating.  No profanity.  Don't speak loud., etc."  Ridiculous.That being said, this place was ridiculously dirty which made me nervous about their tools being sterile.  As soon as I sat down I couldn't wait for my nails to dry so I could leave.Why two stars then you ask?  Surprisingly the manicure was decent and stayed on for a long time compared to others.As I'm moving to Madison soon, if anyone has nail salon suggestions, please let me know as I will not be going back to VIP.
