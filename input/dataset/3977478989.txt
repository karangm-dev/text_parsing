My Taiwanese friend and her husband took me to this yummy place for freshly made dumplings and noodles. We ordered so much food because we were so hungry. They were surprised to know that we don't have high quality steamed dumplings in Chicago, so this is really a treat! Spicy dumplings were so good and came with some rice noodlesSteamed dumplings are very good and so soupy. Snow pea sprouts are very good and good portion. Beef noodle soup was decent 4/5 starFried tofu was a surprise because it's not greasy and it's egg tofu! We ordered red bean pancake for dessert and it was 5 star!! If I come back to Pittsburgh again, I will make sure to visit this place. Definitely come early or you'll have to wait because it's a small place. Would love to try their bubble tea next time.
