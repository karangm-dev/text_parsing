Always a fantastic breakfast place. It's totally worth the wait in line. Expect to wait up to 15-20 minutes. These guys make a simple bacon, egg and cheese sandwich taste amazing! The warm cookies are a real treat so they are highly recommended. Patrick is great and very accommodating. Thanks for making the warm cookie happen when we thought you were sold out!
