DO NOT go to this Sam Woo restaurant. I've gone to Sam Woo's more than I'd like to admit in my lifetime. The Las Vegas Sam Woo is the WORST I've ever been to. The service is HORRIBLE and quality and taste of the food is not comparable to the Sam Woo's in Los Angeles area. AGAIN, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AT THIS SAM WOO!
