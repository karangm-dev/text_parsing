As a follow up to my previous post about the disappointing customer service at Hilton, the dissatisfaction continues. Hilton has been "playing" with my bank account by charging and reversing several times and finally charging it. This is in direct conflict with a statement on their key cards that you stay happy or stay free (or something to that effect). I did not set out to receive a free stay, but after their continued dipping into my account, I believe they should follow their policy.
