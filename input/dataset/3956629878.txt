The staff didn't know the pricing, the menu didn't have prices for some items and they didn't have much left of meats.  When I was getting ready to pay for the food I waited at the register to pay for a little to long with the staff standing there doing nothing.  The pulled chicken and leg quarter were dry and flavor less, the ribs didn't have much flavor so we had to smoother it with bbq sauce, the sides of green beans with bacon had no bacon or flavor, the side of mac and cheese didn't have flavor, the corn bread was overly dry and the portions were not worth the price. With all that has been said I'm sorry to say it but I will not be going back
