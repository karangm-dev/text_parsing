Do not use!!! I was told over the phone that they would be able to change the battery in my Tissot T-touch watch. I asked twice as I had been to another jewelry store who stated they had to send it to Tissot and the cost would be $150. They assured me it would be $45 and an two weeks. If there would be any additional costs, they would call with a quote. I dropped off the watch Nov. 21st and heard nothing back for over 3 weeks. After unsuccessfully trying to get through to the Bay, I contacted the Time Shop who informed me they sent it away to Tissot as they could not do the job and the cost was $250... ludicrous. I told them to not do a thing and send it back immediately. They informed me, since they sent it to Tissot (without my permission), I wouldn't be getting it back until the new year! A month and a half and no watch and no battery change. The Bay is a joke and so is the Time Shop. I'm still waiting for the reply from the Bay, from the email I sent them earlier this week about my experience.
