Went to get a cup of coffee and some breakfast. I expected to wait in a long line, but after waiting for over 15 minutes in the drive thru I finally make it up to place my order. The lady was very rude. I asked for almond milk, she said they're out. I asked for soy, she got loud with me said said WE. ARE. OUT. OF EVERYTHING. She could have found a nicer approach instead of yelling at me. I got to the window to pay for what I was able to order and she told me that if I wanted my food I would need to come inside and leave my dog in the car because it was unsanitary for me to have my 3 lbs yorkie in my lap while she was handling food. I never heard of anything more stupid in my life. I won't be going back there
