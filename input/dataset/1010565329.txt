I cannot praise Dr. Russell enough and all the staff! The front staff is so kind and sweet, they do everything they can to work with you and help you with scheduling.. I have never had a long wait here even when they are packed the longest wait I've had was half an hour past my appointment.. Dr. Russell is so kind and attentive.. he takes his time listening to your concerns and helps you.. The whole staff from front to back are so sweet and helpful.. I know I'm in good hands with this place and Dr. Russell.. he's truly one of a kind and knows how to help you get back to feeling 100%
