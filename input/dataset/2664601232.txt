I've been a Top Golf member for quite awhile and I went there on Sunday with a friend and the service was terrible, not only did we not get the food we ordered but the host tried charging us for the meals as if we've ate, I'll go to the Top Golf in Gilbert a try before I allow an employee to think I'd deceive them I'm appalled....
