There's only one reason why I consider making a trip to Maizie's.  The jalapeno ranch dressing.  5 up for the jalapeno ranch.  It's aMAIZIEng!  Your tastebuds will not be disappointed.  I dip everything in it.  Sandwiches with jalapeno ranch.Sweet potato fries with jalapeno ranch.Salad with jalapeno ranch.Fish with jalapeno ranch.Fruit with jalapeno ranch.Dessert with jalapeno ranch (just kidding).I usually stick to the same few dishes (with a few substitutions here and there) and the staff is very kind and accommodating.  They serve meat, but have veggie choices - plural - unlike other restaurants that only have one veggie choice.Sit inside or out.  I choose out because it's less crowded and not annoyed by the tellies.  But they do allow pets so keep that in mind if you don't like eating next to animals.
