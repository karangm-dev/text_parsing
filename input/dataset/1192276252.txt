There is a line constantly out the door for melt and for a good reason. The icecream and sherbet let's not forget that for the lactose free individuals is divine. The whole style is great also. From the little Chinese take out boxes, to the fortune cookie, Melt has a style all of its own. Also, for any avid sticker collectors they have some pretty cute stickers to decorate that Mac or hydro that are constantly used for stickers. Again, Melt has a great product, fast, and delicious.
