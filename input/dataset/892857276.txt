Love the beef brisket sandwich, it's had me coming back almost half a dozen times in the last month alone & I don't know how they cook the fries but they are amazingly well done...I need to start sampling the rest of the menu but I'm still to addicted to the brisket sandwich and fries & all for under $20 including a pop...that's a great dinner choice for anyone living on a budget like myself
