I am surprised that I am giving a dry cleaner a five star rating. I have been searching for a different dry cleaner ever since moving to phoenix and  I finally found one that does things fabulously without swindling you and sodomizing you at the same time!I dropped off my blazers and jackets this morning and asked the girl working the counter if I could possibly pick them up at the end of the day.  It was already 9:10 am and missed the cut off point, but she made an exemption. She said no problem, Now that's customer service!  I love that. :)I highly recommend this place. The same day pick-up is awesome, the price is affordable and customer service is top-notch.
