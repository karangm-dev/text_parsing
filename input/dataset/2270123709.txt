I have visited this location three times. The staff is nice, but they get the order wrong every time and sometimes they are out of things that should be standard for an ice cream shop (out of hot fudge? At 6pm?). I know, "first world problems". :) I can understand one visit being disappointed, but three in a row? We probably won't be back. We'll give the local ice cream place across the street (Carolina Creamery) a try.
