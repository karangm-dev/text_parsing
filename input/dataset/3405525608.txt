Wow...this show brought up every emotion in me from my first crush, to passionate love, to the pain of losing a parent, and then went on to fill my heart with happiness and joy. The music, the stage set up, the performers...all amazing. I love The Beatles but I think any person would like this show. Warning: beware of the bar's Beatles themed drinks. They are large (comes with a souvenir cup) and you will almost pee your pants because you will refuse to miss one second of the show. I pretty much ran in heels as soon as I could escape the exiting crowd. :P Also, go to the souvenir shop earlier in the day to avoid the after show crowd.
