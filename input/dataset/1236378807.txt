This hand wash place was recommended to me by my neighbor. Unfortunately, I did not have a good experience at Alamo hand wash. The lady who checked us in for the wash was not friendly, but she might've had a cold that day.The wash of the exterior of the car was mediocre. A number of areas in the interior were missed completely. The entire visit took probably 30 minutes and I would expect a much better job for having to wait that long for a car wash.
