I finally have the time to leave a review for this terrible restaurant. I was at fireside a little bit ago and had the unfortunate luck of ordering the hamburger. What I got was an undercooked mess. I ordered and even reiterated that I would like my hamburger cooked medium and what I got could only be described as well done with a raw center. Only at fireside could you get a burger cooked that defies the law of physics. I am not even sure how it is possible to cook a hamburger both well done and raw at the same time. The waitress did the best she could given the quality of meat and the skills of the cooks. Complaining to the manager was a waste of time and effort. Run away and never look back.
