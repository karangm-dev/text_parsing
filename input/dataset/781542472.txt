I wouldn't go out my way to order food from this place. I picked the Jasmine's Favorite Lamb plate. I was pretty disappointed on the portion size of the Lamb. Too small of a portion and too high of a price. The tahini sauce was too liquidity for me. It would have been nice if it had a more solid texture. The rice was the best part of my meal. For $16 I expected a worthy meal. I also ordered a slice of cheesecake. It was a bit on the warm side when I received it. However, it tasted pretty good.
