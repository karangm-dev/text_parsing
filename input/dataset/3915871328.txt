So delicious! I had their seasonal Tres Azteca with the raspberry syrup- tasted like Godiva chocolate. It's a little on the rich side, but very tasty. My fianc√© had the churro latte which is now his new favorite. If we lived closer, this place would become our go-to coffee spot. Just keep in mind they are in a very small space, which means there may be a wait time with your drink. Nonetheless, support local business!
