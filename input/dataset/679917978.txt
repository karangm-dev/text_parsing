I'd have to agree with the 1-start rating.  We went in, intending to purchase a ceiling fan.  We had previously purchased an outdoor fan and bathroom fixture.  I gave it two stars, because In the two previous purchases there was one gal, the same gal, who was extremely helpful.  She was very pleasant and active in helping us find what we needed.  Yesterday, the helpful girl with with Customers. There were three other staff behind the counter.  And while they weren't rude, they weren't eager to help my find my previous order.  Nor did they seem interested in helping me pick a new fixture or new lights. I went to the floor and found the fan we previously purchased, but couldn't see the model number.  Not one of the three staff was willing to get up from behind the desk to come identify the model number.  And then on top of that a new person walks in and both girls jumped to assist him.  The third guy behind the counter was too busy eating his lunch to even bat an eye too see what the heck was going on in the show-room.  If  this was my shop, I'd be on floor making sure my 4 staff are busy helping Customers and improving my business, not degrading it and eating up my payroll, doing nothing.
