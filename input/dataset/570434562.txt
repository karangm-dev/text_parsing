Perfectly delicious! My kids requested Golden Donuts over Bosa which used to be their favorite. The donuts are freshly made daily and have a good selection. Customer service is friendly and shop is clean. Last several times we've been there they've thrown in complimentary donut holes or as I like to call them, little clouds of heaven! The Boston Cream has cream throughout the donut, not just the middle like some shops. Kids always get long johns and frosted with sprinkles and say they prefer this frosting to others. Luckily Golden Donuts is in our neighborhood which makes it easy to get our donut fix!
