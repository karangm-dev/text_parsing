We hired Sapphire Sky for my daughters Bat Mitzvah.  While they had never done a Mitzvah before and had to learn some of the Jewish traditions, they are an amazing band.  Ashley worked with us and they had all of my guests up and dancing for hours.  I would hire them again for any wedding, corporate event or Mitzvah - they were amazing!!
