Today I had an appointment at 2pm and I arrived there at 10min to 2pm just to be sure I got there with enough time to spare. I ended up waiting for 30 min and the walk-in people that came in after me got seated first. Apparently, this place doesn't honor appointments. I might as well not have taken my time to call two days ahead to set up an appointment. I was disappointed. I saw the techs hurrying with their job just to get to the next one. After 30 min, I called up another nail salon place to see if I can just walk in and be seated right away. I left as soon as I hung up. I went to another nail salon and got serviced right away. They were very friendly and clean and they did an awesome job with my nails including nail art. Anyway, if you can't honor your appointments you might as well make it as a walk in ONLY service. I thought that in business your word is you honor. Apparently not this place.
