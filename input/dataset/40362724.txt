I ordered $1200 worth of baby furniture here. When I placed the order I was told it would take 5-10 days to be delivered to the store. Over 3 weeks have passed now and nothing is in. I called the store to ask for an update and told my order was "Approved". Gee, thanks. I'm glad that me paying the $1200 in cash got it "Approved". When I asked the piece of crap woman on the phone what approved meant and when my furniture would be in she said "all I can tell you is your order is approved" and hung up on me.
