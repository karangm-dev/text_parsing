I wouldn't take my car anywhere else.  These guys are totally honest and reliable.  I've been taking my car here for over a year and they know be my name even though I only come in once every few months.  They are very sincere and tell it like it is.  I like that about a place.  They are very honest in telling me what needs to be fixed right away and what can wait awhile without damaging my car.  Plus, I never have to wait for service.  They'll even price match most competitors.
