Super expensive!! My husband and I just left from date night and spent almost $60 for 2 games of bowling, one light beer and a diet coke in 40 min!  Which is a shame because this just ruled out our local bowling alley as an affordable option.  If you're a mildly experienced bowler you'll even notice how badly the lanes are maintained - only oiled 2x a week according to the receptionist and dry as they come.  We won't be returning unless the prices drop.
