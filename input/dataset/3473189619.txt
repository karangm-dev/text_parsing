First things first, I love MAC and their products. I have been using them for quite a long time. But this particular location has a really consistent pattern of being rude, unhelpful, etc. It almost feels like they judge you (if they even bother to recognize that you are alive and in their store). I hope that these employees can get a little more customer oriented and stop acting like they are holier-than-thou, because it truly has stopped me from buying anything, and this is the only store close to me.
