Horrible service! Purchased on Groupon. The menu extremely over priced! Food was beyond mediocre! Lunch special has no specific days on menu! But don't allow it during the weekend even before 1pm. Nothing we order was good accept the spring rolls... & they were just ok... So lunch at 11:30am on a Saturday was 57$! Neverrrr again!
