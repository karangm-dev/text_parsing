Man, I hate to do this review. When I used to work in this area I used to eat breakfast here all the time. And occasionally lunch. Went there today because I was down that way for lunch and it was just terrible. I wont even get to the service because it was mediocre but tolerable. But I ordered the Shay Burger and it had absolutely no flavor as if they used zero seasoning. One piece of bacon on my burger (which was a first for me ever seeing that) and although it had mushrooms and cheese on it i couldn't taste any of the flavor. And lastly for my meal the fries were undercooked. How do you under cook fries?? My wife's fish sandwich looked worse than a Fish Filet from McDonalds.  After the waitress brought it out she asks..."did you want cheese on that".  And it was tasteless.  I guess I can scratch Shay's off my list.
