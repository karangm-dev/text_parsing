I recently started working uptown and I wanted to find a local place to hang out  after work some nights, I found this little gem.  On the corner of Brevard Court and Church Street, this place is simply amazing!  I'm on a budget, so 3.50 pints on Thursday night is exactly what this girl was looking for.  The bartender, Libby, knows what I want when I walk in and I've only been there few times.  Great service and excellent prices!  I love this place!!!
