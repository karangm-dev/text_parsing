Been here twice. Food was good the first time so we went back, but the waitress was extremely unprofessional on our second visit. Both myself and my girlfriend ordered an Arctic Char dish largely based on wanting to try the Pear Kimchee topping. We both received our dish, couldn't find any of it, and assume it was just used in the broth or something similar. While wrapping up a nearby table received the dish with the correct topping and we brought this up with our waitress. Her immediate response was "There's nothing we can do", so I asked to speak with her manager about it. My girlfriend left the bathroom to find our waitress yelling about the issue to the manager, whose solution was to "offer to do a shot" with me. Really not interested in returning for a third visit when there are so many other good options in the area.
