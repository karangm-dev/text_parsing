OMG I continue to punish myself and go here. Took 6 days to get a refill done for my son. They blamed the doctor and the doctor blamed them. 5 visits and multiple calls. AHHHH! Then today I go in to get some Easter basket fillers and my goodness that kid Josh is rude as hell. And not just me but every single woman in line. He was cool with the older gentleman buying a months worth of wine and liquor but I was next and he was so unfriendly and put off! Why oh why do I go here. Oh because it is a mile from my house. I must like to be annoyed! Good thing Happy was on the radio!
