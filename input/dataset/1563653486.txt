This one of my favorite dining experiences ever. I really loved the adventure and mystery of the whole thing. It was a fun challenge to guess food and an even more interesting one to try and use utensils in the dark. I'd highly recommend this to anybody looking for an out of the box dinner.You really can't see anything in there, it's Pitch Black. Although sometimes you can see the infrared goggles of the waiter or waitress if they're looking directly at you.
