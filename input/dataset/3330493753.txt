My favourite shisha place in Mississauga. I've been to quite a few but the service and overall environment of Al-Omda keeps me coming back. The staff are very friendly and greet you as soon as you walk in. The shisha flavours are plentiful and only $10. I suggest getting grape-mint, it's my favourite flavour. They also provide you with disposable hookah pipes and if it is available, ask for an ice pipe. The food is also cheap and tasty, french fries are extra crispy. While it can get quite busy at times, the staff do their best to get you seated immediately. Lastly, their kunafa is the best I've ever had, not too sweet and delicious.
