I have ordered albos 3 times while visiting Las Vegas. The food is affordable and tasty. That said the people on the phone don't seem to understand what people expect out of a cashier at a delivery place. The person seemed more interested in making me laugh than making sure my order was right and they could deliver it. This time my delivery driver was kicked out of my hotel and I had to come to the entrance to get my food. If I wanted to walk through my hotel I wouldn't have ordered delivery, I would have gotten food from the food court.The previous time I ordered they had no problem getting into our room but we discovered on the receipt had my ENTIRE CREDIT CARD NUMBER, EXPIRATION DATE, CC2 CODE, AND ZIP  WRITTEN ON THE RECEIPT. The driver kept a copy. This is completely unacceptable as it invites identity theft. The person answering the phone also seems very distracted and set the phone down twice (for 5 min or so each time) to take an order from a customer in the store rather than taking the minute or two to finish our transaction or placing me on hold to deal with the in store customer. In short fast, cheap, food with a very poor execution.
