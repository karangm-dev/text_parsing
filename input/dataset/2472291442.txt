Went yesterday. Surprisingly costly ($39) for what turned out to be a 45 minute guided, group tour, starting at a designated, specific time.  (I asked and was told that I absolutely could not walk through the exhibit by myself, at my own speed.)On hindsight, this tour/exhibit was, from my perspective, a mix of the very well art-directed and creatively designed sculptures and video presentations commonly placed around the switchbacks as crowds wait in long lines for popular rides at Disneyland and/or Universal Studios theme parks, combined with the faux serious, (intentionally bad) family joke quipping guides at Disneyland's Jungle Cruise. Disappointingly, the costumes and other character props did not appear to me (nor did the exhibit ever claim them to be, as far as I saw) actual screen-used costumes and weapons and armors from the "Avengers" films, but rather 'mere' recreations crafted for this exhibit. On my tour, the people who enjoyed it best were a handful of enthusiasts in their 20s who clearly really loved the recent "Avengers" films (and who were genuinely thrilled to be there), and a boy about 9 years old. Lastly, I would note that the detailed 'information' about the various Avengers detailed throughout this exhibit is based on the versions of the characters portrayed in the Marvel movies of recent years, with no reference to the Marvel comic book versions on which they are based (except in the gift shop).
