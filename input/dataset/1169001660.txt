Every time I go to the Yummi Banh Mi food truck I am never disappointed. The lemongrass pork banh mi is my favorite of all the sandwiches. I have not ordered the rice bowls but will the next time they are here at this building. The sandwiches are so delicious and full of flavor. The service is friendly and fast. I could easily eat more then just one sandwich. Might have to order two next time, the second one might last until dinner (no promises). If you like food with flavor and great service check out this food truck.
