Not going to lie, I only came here bc I had a Groupon.  It was Sat afternoon and the place is dead empty.  Stood at the front waiting to be seated but the 2 staffs were to busy to look after as they were behind the bar talking and laughing their @ss off. So we waited a bit and still no one came over. Had to go to the bar to ask them and they were like seat yourself anywhere.  Okay if you going to put a sign at the door "Please wait to be seated" do not tell me to seat myself.  Price is here much more expensive than the normal Dim Sum places in Chinatown, and with limited selections. We ordered 5 dishes - The B.B.Q Pork Bun(on par), Ham Sui Kok : Meat Dumplings (Not crispy enough and not hot), Vegetarian Dumplings(A little bland but not a fan of this dish to begin with), Sticky Rice In Lotus Leaf W.Pork(My fave dish, portion was huge and very tasty) & some dessert with sesame inside. They also charge for tea here like most Chinese place but we opted for water but they still charged us, but the staff was nice enough to remove it once we mentioned it.   Overall food is decent but atmosphere is dead, no one here and super quiet.  Awkward!!
