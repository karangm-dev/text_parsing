Ok To be fair I did not actually have anything done,I did not get that far because the fist time I was very nervous trying to find a place for hair and makeup but when I did schedule my appointment the first time the young lady that helped me was very beautiful but a bit of a snob she was very curt with me but I choose to just let it be (she might be having a bad day) Close to my wedding day still nervous about the stylist that would be doing my hair and makeup on the big day I called to confirm and ask about who my stylist would be, but the gentleman who answered the phone was surprisingly very curt and had not much to say he actually mentioned that I certainly was not the only bride makeup and hair this stylist had done and that they do this all the time. He had not a clue on how to put me at ease. I think that yes experience and a name like Robert Cromeans salon goes a long way but I feel that the staff or at least the ones that I had this experience with needs to be a little more humbling and appeasing to the customers that seek their services why? For the simple fact that I can look up the next five star place that will offer me the same service but with a smile and a feeling of you are welcomed here. I'm happy to say there's a happy ending to this story I found an amazing group who had me at my pleasure to serve you with a big smile. I'm too old to put up with this but if you don't mind snobby people with a chip on their Shoulders please enjoy. I think I'll go where I'm wanted. Xoxo ;)
