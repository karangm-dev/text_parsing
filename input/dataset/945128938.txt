Awful experience. We went on a Monday night and had to wait over 45 minutes to get in. After we got in, we were sat and never saw another waiter. I'm not sure why we had to wait so long when everything, including drinks, were self serve. Our plates were not cleared until after we left. Overall a very disappointing visit, don't plan on returning.
