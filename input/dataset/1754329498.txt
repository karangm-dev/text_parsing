In general, one of my favorite breakfast places to go to in Pittsburgh. Setting of the restaurant is more like a diner than it is a restaurant, but that does nothing to detract from what it's best at serving: good old-fashioned breakfast food. The pancakes here are quite fantastic ... my favorite kind being the banana chocolate chip pancakes. Yeah, it's probably not light on calories, but to be honest, that's not really a thought if you opt to go for these. The chocolate chips are warm and well-melted into the actual pancake itself, making for one delicious yummy bite after the next. Their hot cakes are also a nice choice along with the stuffed raspberry French toast, which was oh so good. The raspberry sauce was actually not as tangy as I anticipated ... which is a good thing, considering that it would have been a sore spot (too sour) if it contrasted too much with the sweet consistency of the dish. In general this is a great breakfast spot to hit up ... oh and also a decent joint for sandwiches, my favorite being the Russian Reuben with the tender beef, great sauerkraut, along with the cheese & thousand island dressing combo that make for a delicious combination.
