The food menu is prepared by an LA celebrity chief who branched out of  the west coast bel air scene into Las Vegas as a start up satellite Restutant that runs authentic Thi. Food the service was friendly and the restaurant was clear the food was not to expensive and it was very tasty the service also was catering meaning generous in altering and or adapting foods and had really fast take out times and sit down delivery times. Great music and a fairly decent sized Restaurant to sit a family of 8 with smiles.
