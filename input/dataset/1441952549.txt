Could not find the MORNINGSIDE and SHEPPARD location, which is the nail place I'm referring to.Awful, horrible experience.Wanted Bio-gel, told it was Bio-Gel, girl did not speak English, should have known from that point, it was going to be BAD.My nail chipped (French manicure) the next morning?Called, went bk, fixed chipped nail, OMGosh, chipped that night again. Another nail broke, I don't know what they use but do NOT get BIO GEL.It cost me a lot more to get my nails fixed, somewhere else, they look great, But what a timely, wasteful experience.DO NOT GET BIO GEL....(I'd give NO stars but can't post this!)
