Very disappointed in this business today.I'm a vet and I was excited to go sight in my air rifle and was told at the front counter that they don't allow air rifles because the pellets will bounce back and hit myself or others....Ok I'm sorry, really? You'll allow .50 if it's frangible ammo but you won't allow a .177 pellet that disintegrates into nothing when it hits a target?Dang, I was looking forward to bringing a bunch of vet friends here too.
