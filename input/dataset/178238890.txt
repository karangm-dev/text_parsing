The service/help is spotty, at best. Most of the staff don't know anything beyond what is written on the box. Many don't even know that. More than once, we've been approached by staff asking to scan the items we've already chosen so they can get their commission or credit or whatever, without actually helping us. It's brazen and bizarre. Fry's is the quintessential nerd shopping experience. Yes, it's easier to point and click with your mouse on amazon.com. But, if you want to see it first or just browse for hours selecting items you never knew you needed, this is the spot!
