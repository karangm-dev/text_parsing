Dr. Justesen is a wonderful dentist that cares a great deal about his patients. I have been a patient of his for over 20 years. My mother was a patient of his and I now take my daughter. His entire staff is amazing and many of them have been working there for years. Even when I haven't been going regularly, the second I come in Liz always remembers me and asks about my daughter. They don't pretend to care about their patients but truly do. I highly recommend Dr. Justesen for all your dental needs!
