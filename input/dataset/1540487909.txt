So disappointed ..  This could be such an amazing shopping experience.  Make this more like Uptown Phoenix.  Urban with wood, greenery and modern retail shops. Put in restaurants like Le Grande Orange, Butters, Luci's, Southern Rail etc.....Bring in new locations like Boudin Sourdough, etc...Put a gym on top with a running track on top floor encased in solar windows.Think creative and unique!This is a great location.  For us that live here in summer it is great to have an indoor mall.Good luck Macerich only want this mall to succeed
