Q: Is there any Las Vegas hotel that doesn't have a Cirque du Soleil show? A: That was rhetorical.I've seen most of the Cirque shows and The Beatles LOVE is so far my favorite. Probably because The Beatles are TEN THOUSAND TIMES BETTER than the Cirque house band playing quasi-rock with the operatic singer. It's not that the house band is bad, it's just I've never really left a Cirque show thinking, "Hey, I really want to buy that KA soundtrack." The seating for LOVE was circular with the stage in the middle. We sat around 2/3's up and the seats were excellent. I think even the highest "cheap" seats (and by cheap I mean expensive) are probably pretty decent. Conversely, if you sit in the first row, right next to the stage, although you'll be able to see the sweat stains on the performers (how cool is that?), you'll probably miss the 75% of the show that's behind them. The show was awesome. Lights, sounds, dancers, acrobats, trampolines, smoke, color... Volkswagens (i.e., Beetles). A Fahrvergn√ºgen on the senses. The only downside were the couple of guys next to us who for some reason thought this was an audience participation karaoke event. Memo to singers: "Uh, just 'cuz you know the words doesn't mean you're obligated to sing." Just saying.Love, love, love.
