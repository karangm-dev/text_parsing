Wouldn't go back. Wasn't the worst thing ever. I went for lunch with coworkers and got the mac and cheese. I've definitely had better, but it's fast food. I actually had to ask for it to be warmed up because it cane out pretty cold and they threw a fit. Nonetheless, will not be giving it another try. I can make better mac and cheese at home.
