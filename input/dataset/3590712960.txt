Conveniently located nearby Eglinton subway station, an easy online booking system, amazing prices (including weekday discounts), great service, nice clean facilities.My 1 star rating obviously has nothing to do with the operations of this place, which has many great things going for it, but about the brazilian wax itself.I have been here for a brazilian wax twice, probably about a year apart. The first time, the results were..well, not great. It was enough that this did not become a "go-to" place, despite the great price.The first visit:Let's be honest: this is an uncomfortable painful process. But oh dear god, the pain here is pretty bad. It's a weird technique of waxing large patches, and pulling completely upwards. In addition, there was some uncomfortable rewaxing certain areas happening....well...you really shouldn't put your little lady through that.The result: Patchy job, with areas that were left in pain for days (potential burn from re-waxing? who knows).The process probably took 15min, and there is a lot of pride taken in the speed that this is completed....The second time I came here:It was completely out of convenience, need, and desperation. The pain was just as awful as the first visit. The improvement: there was no re-waxing of already waxed areas this time around.The result: broken hairs, and missed patches. It was like this was done in the dark with an at-home waxing kit. Anyways - the broken hairs ended being a huge problem when it comes to maintenance. The convenience is there, but the quality is way off for me. Ladies, be nice to your body, understand if the wax is working or not working for you - sometimes the cost savings isn't worth it.
