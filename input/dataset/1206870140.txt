came to check out the bar menu. i really would like to check out the regular menu next time, but i need to make a lot more money. i've been reading one of my favorite foodblogs (www.eatinglv.com) and saw a review on the best burger in vegas. i was suprised it wasn't located in one of the many burger joints in vegas (burger bar, blt, etc.). it was in a fine dining, michelin rated restaurant. i knew that bradley ogden is a seasonal, farm to table type of restaurant, so i never guessed that they would even have a burger on the menu. burger is very straightforward. brioche bun, cheddar cheese, meat. mayo, ketchup, pickles, mustard, and fries on the side. also, the meat is basted with red wine butter as it cooks on a  wood fire grill. i thought, "man a lot goes into this burger." and i was sooo right when i bit into it. juicy, meaty, flavorful, and most of all delicious. worth the $16 dollars.
