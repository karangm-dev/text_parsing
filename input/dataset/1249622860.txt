If you like pinball you will never want to leave the Pinball Hall of Fame. Not only is it one of the greatest attractions in Vegas, but it also has some of the best staff members around. I regret I didn't visit it when I actually lived here, but every time I visit Las Vegas, the Pinball Hall of Fame is on the top of our entertainment list.  If you happen to live in Vegas I recommend you check our their gamer's league night... and write a review, because it may be the reason we move back to Vegas. This time we went with a group of friends and I got to play the new Wizard of Oz. We also come across the sequel to When Mars Attacks:  Revenge from Mars!! 3D graphics which change from level to level, amazing play and very forgiving... for us amateurs. Also they have some of the rarest pinball games, so if you are a connoisseur of pinball this place is for you! Gauntlet, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Dragon's Lair are part of the arcade (not pinball).  My favorite Pinball: The Addams Family, Arabian Night's, Wizard of Oz And yes they have a change machine :)
