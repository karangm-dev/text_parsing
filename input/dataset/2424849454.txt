Another excellent meal yesterday.  We had chicken teriyaki, beauty Alaska roll, scallop heaven roll, rock and roll.  All of the food tastes fresh.  Good portions and we were served quickly even though the place was packed.  The staff are all very friendly.  They take the Entertainment card every visit.  Always order takeout from here as well.  No matter how large the order they always have it ready by the time I get there within 20 minutes.  Love this place.
