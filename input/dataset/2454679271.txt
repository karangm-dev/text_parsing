This doctor gave my phone number to a Omega-3 supplement company without my permission! It's the same company he tells patients is the only omega 3 supplement that will help them!  Where are your morals?! Cancelling my future appointment. Will never go back. Besides all that, when I asked about sjorgens disease, he told me to see my primary dr. Meanwhile he could have performed Rose Bengal, Lissamine green, and Schirmer eye tests. When I told him about my rosacea and that my mom also has it and it attacked her eyes, he didn't flip my eyelids to look for signs of rosacea.  When I asked if it was an infection, he said no. I asked how he could tell and he snipped, "because I looked in your eyes!" Overall, he was condescending towards me and not helpful. It's been 4 weeks and my eyes are still bright red and killing me. No relief. Absolute misery. Hopefully my new ophthalmologist will perform the necessary tests and answer my questions respectfully.
