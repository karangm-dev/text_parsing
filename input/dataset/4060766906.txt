Worse delivery service I have every experienced. Promised our furniture between 1:15 - 5:15. The guys just got to our house at 6:35! I don't plan on tipping them and I got a delivery refund. We had to cancel plans with my husbands friends that he hasn't seen in 20 years since he left the army basic training.  They kept telling me that the house before ours bought a ton of furniture.  Not my problem it's theirs. I hate excuses. This is ridiculous. I'm so upset. If they came at the time they promised we could have been eating dinner by now. Instead we are waiting for these Inconsiderate people who obviously don't value their returning customers time. (I need to buy more furniture but won't be buying from them again.)
