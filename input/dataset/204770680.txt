Sean did an amazing job on our floors.  He has exacting specifications which is exactly what you want on a job like this. He did almost the entire house for us. He uses great suppliers and we were able to go them and pick out just the right flooring for our job. He also did our stairs and was able to stain them to match our selected floor perfectly. He advised on several areas related to the final finish of the job that really made a huge difference in the end result. Additionally, he was very accommodating of our circumstances relative to multiple projects going on in the home at the same time. On top of all that, his pricing was very competitive. But more importantly, I knew from the consultation that he was serious about doing an excellent job.  I can't say enough positive things about a job superbly done!  I would highly recommend him.
