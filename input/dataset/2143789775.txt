I brought my new 2018 Tacoma that I had bought from another dealer (because that dealer gave me a better deal) a month ago to Right Toyota (because Right was closer to my home), due to a defect in my instrument panel cover.  Right said it was caused by "external influences," which meant they would not cover it under my warranty.  I then went to my original dealer where I bought the truck and after their diagnosis, they determined that it was a manufacture defect and replaced it under the warranty.So sad that Right (Wrong) Toyota treated me the way they did.  I wonder if it was just because I didn't buy my truck their originally, but, they still have an obligation under the manufacture warranty to fix it.Shame on them.  Either they are incompetent or lazy.  Either way, they were Wrong Toyota.
