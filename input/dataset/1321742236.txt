Huge portions, fair prices and a wrap around case of baked goods means a very happy Yelper!  After going to Weiss a few months ago, my friends said "you need to try Bagel Cafe, it's the best Jewish deli around"!Bagel Cafe has a very home-like feel to it and the menu is printed on a multi-page newspaper.  I went with a half-chicken salad sandwich that was still a decent size.  I kept eying my friend's large 1/2 sandwich he ordered which was loaded with meat and I don't think cost more than $15.For dessert I went for their smaller sized cookie (the large is gigantic) but there is a whole slew of things to pick from at the entrance!!  Don't take my word for it though, billionaire Venetian owner Sheldon Adelson was at the table behind us!  I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu!
