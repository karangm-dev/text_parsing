They had offered free wax first time visit, so I went ahead and did my eyebrows. I moved here from Miami about a year ago and haven't been able to find a place where they do my eyebrows and keep the shape I have. I wasn't too happy with the lady that did my eyebrows... She didn't do a clean job and messed up the shape of one of my eyebrows. Is there any place in Charlotte that can do a good job waxing eyebrows. No luck yet.
