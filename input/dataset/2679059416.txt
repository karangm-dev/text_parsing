Hands down the best vet / boarding I've ever used. The facility is clean and well maintained, the staff is friendly and accommodating, the veterinarians are extremely knowledgeable and thoughtful. I also board my 10 y.o Yorkie here. He had never been boarded prior to Boca Park and I was a nervous wreck leaving him in a kennel, but I travel a lot with work and my options were limited. Much to my surprise, my dog has excelled emotionally (he is way more outgoing at the dog park) and even gets excited to see the staff when I drop him off for subsequent visits. Highly recommended!Update: We moved out of Vegas (moment of silence). His new vet already pales in comparison. I want to give a special shout out to Sarah at the front desk who consistently went above and beyond to provide stellar service to me and care to my dog. Not only was she knowledgeable and extremely prompt but she continues to help me handle problems with the new vet as they arise. Plus, I genuinely believe that she loves my Yorkie (as she fondly referred to him as "Snaggle-Tooth"). Sarah - thank you to everything you did / do for us!
