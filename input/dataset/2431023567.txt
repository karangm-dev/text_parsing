We called to ask if they had any red Escalades because we were ready to buy that day. We didn't want to wait because our other vehicle had broken down beyond reasonable repair. They said yes so we made the 30 min trip to Monroeville. We get there and they try to show us other vehicles. After about 10 minutes, we were told they didn't have any red Escalades and that it'd have to be ordered. We walked out. Wasted an hour of driving for this crap dealership and service.
