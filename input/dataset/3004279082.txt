I went to a Sunday brunch at Terrace Pointe Cafe and it was great! They have unlimited mimosas for $24!! Who wouldn't want in on that? There is an option for inside or outside seating by the pool and the service was outstanding. I was with a large group and we were accommodated quickly, everything from the croissants to the meals were all generous portions. Come hungry and leave happy!
