Super disappointed with the service and decor, don't try booking through a third party, they will down grade your room. We booked through bookings.com for a King room, we got a terrible queen room instead. This was extremely disappointing because it was for a birthday surprise for my husband. When we asked if there was any chance of moving, they said not likely, sorry can't help you. We paid $230 for a crappy room, and terrible service. The bed is lumpy, there is missing art on the walls, and the walls need to be washed, or repainted... should have stayed elsewhere...
