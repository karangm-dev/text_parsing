I have been trying to cancel my membership for over a month and conveniently every time I go into the gym I am told the manager is not there and they have no idea when or if he will be in again. Am I to believe the manager does not have a schedule? I have been 3 times and each time the employees are quite rude and tell me that only the manager can hand out the waiver to cancel. The kid working today told me "it depends on if the manager feels like processing the cancellation in the first place and if he does do it it usually takes a while because he doesn't like to" Really? He refused to give me his name, said he did not have to, and said there was no other way to cancel, there is no number to call and no way to contact corporate. I call BS. I can't believe you are able to continue to conduct business this way. I will find a way to cancel, and I will be sure to tell everyone who will listen to stay far away from Blast Fitness.
