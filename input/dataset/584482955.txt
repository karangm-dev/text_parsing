Walked in with our kids and she overheard our daughter say "I want pink ice cream and sprinkles!" And she rudely stated "we don't have pink ice cream or sprinkles. This is all we have." And flipped a sign over. And then ignored us. I looked at the flavors and she said "there are other small ones in the cooler. But we don't have pink ice cream." The place was empty and now I can see why. The staff is rude and treats customers poorly. We left and went to Jarlings where we are always treated well. Can't wait for the hipster dessert trend to die and for this place to close. Don't bother with this overpriced spot.
