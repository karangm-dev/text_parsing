Just took the 6:30am class - My muscles have been so sore from crossfit and I needed a good stretching. I really need more yoga in my life! The class was fantastic! A nice 60 minute class, heated and the music was lovely. The yoga instructor's voice was soothing - which I think is soo important. What a great class.. I feel refreshed! A great studio as well - nice and roomie. Looking forward to my next class!
