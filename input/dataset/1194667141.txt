For an AYCE place it is okay--- a little bit better than the other smaller shops in the area that offer AYCE. The fish was decently fresh but they don't really offer too many varieties,  all you get are the standard salmon, white tuna, egg, surf clam, etc. The rice was free flowing but the fish use was slightly stingier, which is understandable: they want to fill you up with cheaper things. Don't get the salmon rose, it is 60% rice + 10% mayo + 30% salmon, no ika, unless you're into that. The salads were not great.Nothing really stood out, it was all just okay or not great. I feel like the torched sushi was better at another AYCE place down the street, enough to justify the difference in price. The desserts here were all mediocre except for the Melona (one per person!).It's weird to have a pan-Asian menu to me, but it was welcome because we got a little bored of eating 2:1 rice to fish nigiri and rolls and opted for some of the other choices available. The tom yum soup was a nice spicy and sour break!I read some things about bad service, but it was fine for our table of 10. The waiters are a little tough to flag down sometime,s because everyone was always running around busing food, but they were always nice to us and quick to help out when we were able to catch them. The manager even helped us take a pic at the end of our meal.
