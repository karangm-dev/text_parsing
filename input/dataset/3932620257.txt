It was really fun and had great tacos! Every taco I ate became my favorite one and I couldn't really choose from all of them. The couple that did stand out were a pork belly taco and this other pork taco where the restaurant was giving generous amounts of guac and salsa on the side. It was a great event that I would go to again if I am in town :)
