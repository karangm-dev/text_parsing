I called toward the end of the night so I'm not really surprised that the lady that picked up seemed a bit passive-aggressive when I told her I wasn't ready to order and was just asking how late they were open. I called a few minutes later and they told me that it would take an hour since the driver would be taking the pizza on his way home. The driver was a nice, older gentleman. When he called, for some reason my phone didn't register it, so he texted me, and that was nice. I apologised for that and he said he didn't mind.Their pizza smelled fantastic and would probably be great if it were just cheese, but the one we ordered had pineapple only as the topping, and the savoury flavours didn't quite mesh with the sweetness of the pineapple. It was also weird because the pizza smelt heavily of garlic, yet it was nowhere to be tasted. The cheese had a good texture that was chewy in a positive way- not to soft, or too tough- and their crust smelled good but tasted pretty generically bland. We had been really excited to try it because of the smell, so it's unfortunate that it didn't turn out so well.
