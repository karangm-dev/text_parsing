Service- excellent. 5 stars for sure! They refilled our waters like 5 times. They were all very polite and attentive. Food- amazing. Some of the best I've had. Boyfriend got hong kong won ton soup. If I get sick, I will drive from la to get this soup. The broth was so good and flavorful. I got the night market fried rice. Perfect amount of spice. It was sooooo good and soooo big. I couldn't finish it but I wish I could have. Price- 28 even for two. I think that's average lunch price on the strip. Worth it!Atmosphere- open and big. Not too crowded. Perfect for a quick bite to eat!
