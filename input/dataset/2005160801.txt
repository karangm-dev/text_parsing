Love this place tucked within Sola Salon. Lash extensions are better priced than other places in Charlotte and the service is fantastic! Also have gotten brow waxing here - very good. Left with them on fleek. Mingi and Suzy are both super helpful and awesome. Will def be going back to get some more done when my lash babies start looking a little sparse. Two thumbs up!
