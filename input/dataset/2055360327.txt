David Ramos is the guy I use when I need an infestation inspection on one of my listings. What reminded me is of his treatment or consideration of my last inspection I had him do today. As the home is set up he could have said yeah we need to treat, but being the honest guy he is, he found no activity and just billed me for the inspection. Hey these folks are hurting just like everyone else right now and it would have been real easy to lie and no one would know any difference. So if you need monthly treatment for your home, give him a try. He is a nice honest hard working guy.
