Great if you're looking to earn the official ' I drank 200 different beers in this poor excuse for a bar" jacket. File it next to your Hard Rock Cafe embroidered bomber. Intolerable music, overly lit for tying one on. Walls covered in kitschy-antique looking beer signs and plaques like "be a sweetie and wipe the seatie" that make one want to go on a murderous rampage. Everything that is wrong with bars. Period. And 15 tv's all on one wall, just in case there were 15 different television programs you just had to leave your house and watch. If this place wins one more "Best Beer Selection" award, I'm killing that iguana.
