Ok...so I am not a tech geek, and all I wanted to do was ask a few questions about an apple product that I was going to purchase from the store. From the time I walked into this place I felt uneasy. I was blatantly ignored by their customer service people (I know that I looked lost, but nobody even asked if I needed assistance or tell me I needed to make an appointment to just purchase an item). However, after reading some of the reviews, I understand that the customer service people are "Apple Geniuses" with whom you have to make an appointment with. It would have been nice to know that...especially since I associate a "store" as a place where there are salespeople to help you, items to buy, and a cashier to ring you up.  I thought that you only needed an appointment if you needed an Apple product to be serviced.  So it is my bad for my misconception of what is called the "Apple Store"....the name is quite misleading. Now I know that this is not a place to ask a quick question or buy anything unless you have an appointment. Weird!!!!
