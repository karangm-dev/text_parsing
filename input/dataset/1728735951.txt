So I left a review a long time ago for take out and I can't believe I haven't updated it. Bahn Thai is still just as amazing! It ended up turning a once week spot for lunch every week for almost a year! Pineapple fried rice is amazing! Gaeng Mussamun is also amazing. Almost everything on that lunch menu is amazing. Even their Japanese food options and sushi is great! Ask for Mary! She's great!!
