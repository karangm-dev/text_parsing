This was my first time going to Kneaders, and I was impressed. Not only was the food great, but I also enjoyed the environment. I ordered a breakfast sandwich, and the croissant was so soft and flakey. My husband ordered a panini, which I had a bite of, and it was delicious. They had so many tasty looking pastries, it was hard to choose just one. Of course, since its Halloween, I went with a seasonal sugar pumpkin cookie. I will definitely be back. I can see myself coming here for lunch... I prefer this place over Panera.
