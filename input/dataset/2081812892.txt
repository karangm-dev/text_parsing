I would have loved to have actually experienced this place - really, I would have.  The great smells wafting from the kitchen, along with the enticing menu, would have guaranteed that the place would have sold us 2 or 3 appetizers, not to mention several beers/cocktails.  Everyone else's food and drinks looked great.  Sadly, no one wanted to take care of us there.We arrived on a Friday night, so it was pretty busy, but we spotted four free seats right by the front window.  My boyfriend went up to the hostess stand to see if we could just sit down or if we needed to be formally seated.  Of the 3 hostesses standing there, none of them could stop talking among themselves to actually help a customer.  After standing there a couple of minutes, he ended up walking behind them to someone who looked like a manger to see if he could help.  So yes, rough start there.  We were told we could sit there, so we grabbed two, while another couple who knew someone working at the bar grabbed the other two seats.  Someone came to take their order right away......but left us sitting there.  About five minutes go by and someone brings us some water, asking if we have been helped.  I guess he couldn't help us but mentioned that they would make sure someone came by.  Five more minutes and another girl comes by asking, and promising the same thing.  Several minutes later, we decided to up and leave just as a third person was swinging by, not to actually take our order either, but to tell us that someone would get to us eventually.In short, a really lame experience.  I can't remember the last time I was left just hanging at a place like that - no help, no apologies, no caring.  No place for us!
