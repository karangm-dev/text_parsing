CAFE BRICCO is costing the Doubletree return business.  The Manager was unbelievably rude to us.  We've visited the Doubletree the last 4 years for our anniversary, this will be the last time.  After being locked on the patio the very rude manager of Bricco came to the door (I thought to let us in) and told us to jump the fence and go around to get back in.  I've just spent over $200 between our room and service in Bricco and I'm being told to jump a fence?!?  I don't know who pissed in his Cheerio's but it has cost the hotel my business.  Customer service at its worst.
