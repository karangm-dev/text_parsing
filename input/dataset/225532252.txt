Situated in the heart of Leslieville (where customers begrudgingly but dutifully line up for 30 minutes or more for weekend brunch) Le Canard Mort can't really afford to be a completely average experience if it hopes to survive here. But alas, that was our experience :(Located right next door to the ever popular Lady Marmalade, "The Dead Duck" must contend with their neighbour's customer queue covering their doorway and yet, their empty seating does not seem to lure anyone in from the line up.  I guess that should have been a tell tale sign for us.Sadly, even though we made up only 1 of the 3 full tables in the place, we had to ask  for coffee refills, ask for water refills, ask for condiments & the promised toast side dishes and wait a significant length of time for our food to arrive (about 40 mins).  My friends and I (4 of us) all commented that brunch was nothing special (we had eggs benny, forest benny, corned beef hash & the classic breakfast w sausage).  We were all tempted by the variations of benny on the menu (like the duck confit, crab & lobster) but decided the combinations sound a bit too dinner-ish for 11am. Judging by the breakfast sausage that arrived with the classic breakfast, I think we were right to err on the side of caution. It was a big hearty italian spice sausage, that while tasty, was definitely a bit much for the breakfast dish it accompanied.Judging from other reviews on yelp, Le Canard Mort may be a little better for dinner, and certainly the decor & atmosphere is more evening style.  I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt, but I'd be reluctant to come back to try it.
