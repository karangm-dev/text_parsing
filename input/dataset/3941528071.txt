This theater used to be one of my favorites, but it has degraded into one of the lowest quality theaters in Ohio that I'm aware of. The theater itself is like most theaters; You should expect expensive food, drinks, and unhappy staff members. The part of the the theater that concerns me are the patrons that this theater facilitates to. Being a young person, I can understand why other young people want to come to this theater, but they are totally destroying the experience. Several isles up from me, there was a group of teenagers smoking marijuana. There are young men and women fighting inside of the theater and on the sidewalk in front of the theater and nobody seems to care.This isn't a place I'd recommend you bring the family to. You're better off driving a few extra miles and going to the cinema by the canal.
