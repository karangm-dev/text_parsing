I went to see Dr Angelchick in April for breast augmentation and lift. For my first consultation I was at the office for almost 3 hours. I had a million questions and concerns. When I left the office I was well informed and confident that I was with the right doctor. I had been to 5 different doctors for consultations before this and I never left feeling comfortable with moving forward. My surgery went smoothly and I was in very little pain. I was also very happy with the staff and facility at the surgery center. Everybody in his office is great as well! The staff is very attentive to your needs and listens to you when you have a question or concern. I would recommend Dr Angelchick to anybody who is picky and has high expectations, he will deliver the result you are looking for. I am so happy with my results and would definitely go back to his office for any and all procedures that I would consider in the future.
