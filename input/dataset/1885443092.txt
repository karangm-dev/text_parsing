It was horrible... I had 2for1 lunch voucher on the week day so it only costed us $25 for two of us ($30 including tips). So $15 /person for lunch in Vegas is pretty cheap deal but I would save my $15 and rather go get earl's sandwich instead. Food was disgusting. Everything tasted odd ( even miso soup... How hard is it to mess up a miso soup?!?!) and not seasoned correctly. I remember this place used to pretty decent back in the days... But God... Please get rid of soft serve ice cream machine and get a decent ice cream bar!!! It was impossible to get drinks refilled. Servers were so unhappy working there. My advice... Pay 50% more and go to Bacchanal at Caesars palace. It's so much better quality food.
