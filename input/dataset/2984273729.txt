I love Happy Cup.How much do I love it? Well, let's just say I try to convince my wife to stop by every time we drive past. Considering that's just about every day (it's conveniently located by the Safeway in Woodbine), it's amazing I'm not broke yet. Their menu is pretty big, and everything is made with fresh fruit right in front of you. I love bubble tea, so I always add the pearls, but my wife likes their smoothies without anything added. My favourites are the taro slush, green tea milk tea, and the pina colada smoothie. The service here is excellent as well - I am always greeted with a smile of recognition, and every recommendation I've received has been spot on. The decor is inviting, and there's even a Foosball table! If you haven't been yet, you should definitely go. You won't regret it.
