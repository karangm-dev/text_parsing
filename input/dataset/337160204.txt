Terrible! Has a weird smell...pretty much a dive bar. Big huge bar, it is about 1/4 full and they are serving all drinks in plastic cups. I asked the waitress for a glass and she said when they are busy they use plastic. There are literally only 40 people in here and this place holds 200 easy. Beer tastes weird! I would recommend any where else
