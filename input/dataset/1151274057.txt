This place is a SCAM!!! THEY DID NOT MEASURE MY HOUSE!!! I am in the market to replace the carpet throughout my home. Oscar came on behalf of Carpets Galore to provide a free estimate for new carpeting. I asked prior to the appointment for him to bring carpet samples; he brought nothing. I happened to have samples from Home Depot and Lowes, he swore he could beat their estimates. As I watched him walk thru my home, it was obvious he lacked tools (brought by guys from both HD and Lowes) to measure the rooms in my home. This guy "eye-balled" each room and left. When Oscar called with my estimate, he refused to provide a square-footage for my home (because he didn't have one), AND, the carpets he swore he could price-match were now "private label" and I needed to visit his showroom choose carpet. I asked him provide me an estimate based on the closest thing, he refused. His goal was to get me in that store and upsell...scam, scam, scam. But how can you trust anyone who failed to MEASURE THE CARPET IN  IT. STAY AWAY.
