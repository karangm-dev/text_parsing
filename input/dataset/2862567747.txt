After reading all the raves about how good this place was I decided to try it. This place is the epitome of American style Thai food. Why ?Well , for starters, the chicken satay is dark meat and fried. Need I say more ? In fact , I think it was twice fried because it was like eating leather.I've had satay in about 20 different places....always grilled white meat. I could go on and rip this place to hell, but why bother ?With a name like Archi's no doubt Jughead is running this place....
