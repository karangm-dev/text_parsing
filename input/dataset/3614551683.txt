David was the only one to personally respond to my 4 request for a quote, and inspection. The others only sent emails. David showed up and did a complete walkthrough inspection. He spent the time to explain the treatment, and the various pricing offers. His prices were very fair, and his service did what they said the would. The 5 year warranty is a good deal.
