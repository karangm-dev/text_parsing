I have been going to Ashley for a number of years now and have been meaning to write this review for a long time. Ashley is an excellent hair stylist with very reasonable prices and of course a wonderful personality. She is so flexible and thoughtful which goes a long way. She took the time out to bring me a sample hair product from home just for me to try - and she doesn't even sell that product!I usually get a cut and highlights which I have been happy with. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending Ashley to anyone!
