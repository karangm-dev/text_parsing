This place is such a joke. I've spent hundreds if not thousands of dollars here shopping for my mom's business and our personal beauty supply products. On April 4, 2016 when I visited I was prepared to spend at least $100 but I was stereotyped mid shop and was told that if I wanted to shop here I had to leave my purse upfront, this has never happened to me before I have to assume that it's because I was African-American considering all of the Caucasian women have purses in the store .  I ended up leaving here and going across the street to Sally's where they had great customer service and what I was looking to purchase was actually cheaper ! I WILL NEVER RETURN ! If I could give zero stars I would !
