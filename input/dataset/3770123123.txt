We did a taste comparison between Tacos Chiwas and Al Fuego on Bell Rd by the SR51. At the end of the night eating amazing tacos side by side we concluded that if you go to either place you are the winner. Excellent mesquite flavor and texture with a beautiful tortilla perfectly cooked. A welcome addition to the Phoenix taco scene. That being said they have an amazing Verde Gordita that no one in town can touch.
