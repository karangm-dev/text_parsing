I've been to a few specialty candy shops but this is by far my favorite.  The person working(owner?) was so helpful and had THE perfect personality for someone who runs a fun and quirky candy curio shop.  There was so many items and the number of different taffy  flavors was amazing.  I also loved that he posts a little riddle for customers to figure out to win a piece of tardy.  This was a wonderful experience and I really hope more people become aware of it.
