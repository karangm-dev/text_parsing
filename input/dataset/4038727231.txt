I used to work in Caesar's, and my brother told me that BO's burger was rated one of the best in the country by GQ's food critic... so I went to try it out.  Now, several visits later, it's the only thing I've had there.  It's that good.  Definitely get the pickles, they're the best I've ever had.  And the butterscotch pudding.  I wouldn't have ordered it, but our server kind of made me, and I'm glad she did.  I tell anyone I know going to Vegas to go get a burger at BO.
