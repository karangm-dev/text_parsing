FIrst let me explain the 2 stars - we decided to try out the sushi after friends said it was good.We got to Smokin Fins at 6:30 pm thinking we had plenty of time before the Happy Hour menu was over at 7:00 pm. But the wait list was 40 minutes long and we did not get seated until 7:10 pm. Since Happy Hour was over we did not get Happy Hour pricing even though we were waiting on the list for 40 minutes. Left a bad feeling about the service and management. I heard a few other couples expressing their opinions about the same thing but management just said "Sorry"  Now for the good part. The restaurant had a nice atmosphere and was relaxing inside and outside. The food presentation was impressive.  Service was just OK. The sushi was cut very think and cooked just perfect. If our dinners were not so good we would not return. Since the food was so good, we will give Smokin Fins another chance on our next sushi craving.
