I went with several of my coworkers for dinner here and had a so so experience. We had to wait almost 30 minutes for a table to open up for us. There were 9 of us and they only had 1 table that could fit us even though it was half empty in there. I ordered the New York strip, medium doneness and it was dry and had no flavor. The only good thing was the waitress was nice and attentive to our needs. Other than that, this is a so so restaurant.
