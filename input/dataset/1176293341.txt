I have used PetSmart for years for my puppy to get her hair cut. I have recently moved and have started using this location since it is the closest to my home. I have always been pleased with PetSmart grooming but Jess at this location does an exceptional job! Bubbles always comes home looking great. I also am impressed with how clean this location is. Lastly, they are very good at not keeping her for long periods of time. At the other PetSmart I used to take her to, I could drop Bubbles off at 8Am and still not have her ready until noon or 1PM. Both times I have used the grooming department here, I have received the call to pick her up in about two hours!
