How is it possible that a restaurant can keep exceeding my expectations every time?We went with a huge group on Saturday night and it was fab! I love that the hosts at the door are always very happy to see you. The food is delicious!! The menu  has their the old Gio's favourites like the huge meatball (that my friend Jane dreams about) the grilled calamari (that I dream out). The specials are usually planned and thought out, oh and delicious!! The servers are after my own heart: not snobby, very attentive, knowledgeable and take demanding foodie friends in stride. Water always full or decanter on the table - check, side plates for appetizers - check, new cutlery after the appetizer - check!It might be worth noting that they have expanded the restaurant. There used to be an Autoshop next door that they now use for large parties. I was loud and fun! **the only time that you will pay 'through the nose' is if you don't watch how many bottle of wine are flying around**
