I couldn't have asked for a better experience with Erika! She was incredibly helpful, attentive to our house-buying needs, and stayed in contact literally every single day through our 2 month house search. She worked with us looking all around the valley through the summer months. We were first time buyers and had no idea what we were getting ourselves into and Erika answered every question in a very timely manner. She is so nice and fought for us when we finally found "the one." We changed our minds several times when it came to which area we wanted and had high expectations even with a limited budget of $180k but Erika never gave up. She even checked in on us months after we moved into our new home. I have recommended her to everyone I know who is even thinking about buying or selling a house. She's great!
