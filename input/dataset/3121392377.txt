Though I am not a connoisseur of olive oil, I felt more educated after visiting the Olive tap. I've been here a couple times and love the concept of allowing patrons to taste test olive oil's and balsamic vinegar's. Many varieties of which have greatly enhanced our culinary experimentation.I'm not sure if prices are fair or not, but they are priced at a level I'm willing to pay for this quality. Very friendly staff.
