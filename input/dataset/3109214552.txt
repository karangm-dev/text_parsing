Melt - how I've tried to lemming myself to bask in the glorious religious devotion to your sandwiches as the rest of Greater Cleveland. But you are just...so different yet not special. I've had the parmageddon, the godfather(?), a firecracker chicken special, and one of the burgers. Sadly, the burger was my favorite - almost because of the ridiculously smothering of salted grease filled sauce that poses as cheese, reminded me of what I wanted in a burger in college years.This place does to sandwiches what Olive Garden does to italian food. smother it in buckets of butter and fool people into thinking it's flavor. It's not - it's a greasy visual treat that triggers the body's instinctual need for fat as insulation and makes me regret waiting in line to the point I start understanding the plight of Ethiopians. Hype works, unfortunately...4 times for me til I called it quits. I borderline hate this place except the really awesome coleslaw which always tastes like the first time you tasted it, then it spanks you for forgetting. I also like the chalk board drawings. Hate the hipsters swarming here that stylized their insecurity with the "cons with intellectual depth" look. I don't want my food served to me by someone that still has yet to figure themself out, at 29. But what do I know - I'm the Clevelander that is too unhip to like Melt. I will say though, that you get a luxurious amount of food for a very good price. And for that, you're twice as star-worthy as White Castle.
