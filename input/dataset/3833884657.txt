You people make me sick.  It's not bad enough you over charge your customers but you think for that money we could get a little customer service.  To get your service in my home I have to pay $75 to have a tech come out and make my living room an ugly mess.  Instead of showing a little effort and setting up an outlet like I requested I came back to find a cable wire ran from the outside wall, over a door way and on top of the carpet.  Pathetic service.Being a loyal customer of yours get you nothing.  My bill is over $200 every month for only cable and internet and I routinely purchase ppv events.  When I ordered the latest UFC fight and invited 20 something people over to my house to watch it your feed froze and we were forced to leave to watch the fights in a bar.  When I called on Saturday you can't even provide service to let us know if it will come back on and have a message to call back later.  Pathetic.  When I called on Monday to ask for a credit I was told you would only issue a $10 credit. You must hire comedians to do your customer service cause that has to be a joke.  I shouldn't even have to make the call to ask for this. IT SHOULD BE CREDITED IN FULL WITHOUT QUESTION.  I can't think of a more poorly ran business.  The only reason you aren't out of business is because you have a monopoly because your customer service is worthless.
