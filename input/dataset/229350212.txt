A few co workers and I had strolled into this fine establishment for lunch.  I already heard via word of mouth how great the Philly's were.. so my expectations were kinda set pretty high and I was definitely not disappointed! I ordered a Philly with fries, fresh squeezed lemonade, and a chocolate chip cookie aka "heaven on earth".  The Philly was loaded w/ grilled steak peppers mushrooms and some incredibly tasty grilled onions..ok Back to the cookie...this may possibly have been one of the best I've ever had if not the top 3 I'd say.  It's this astoundingly delicious big, fat, baked to perfection filled cookie with these watering milk chocolate chunks.  If you are allergic to chocolate then I understand however, for the rest of the yelp population who goes to Penn Station and does NOT at least try this cookie once is nuts!
