Very unimpressed. They have one teller only at the first of the month. Waited in line for over 35 minutes. When multiple people asked why there were no tellers the greeter told us everyone was on their lunch. I don't understand why they need a greeter when they could have had 2 tellers. Someone had over 10 cash deposits and they still kept her as the only teller. One person in the back of the line made a scene and said she was going to leave her money and leave the bank. She actually got pulled to the front of the line and was helped. She might have been there 15 minutes total. I guess the moral of the story is make a huge scene so they take care of you? What makes it worse is their greeter/customer service persons attitude. She deflected every single complaint instead of being apologetic about the wait she was going into how many required hours they have and talking about labor laws. Zero customer service. New management necessary
