Stopped in for our first visit today with my family. Needless to say it was a great first experience. They had so many little treats to pick from! And I'm not talking about just cookies and desserts! They had cute little gifts you could purchase too! They lady who took our order was friendly and had great recommendations for our family. Your food was scrumptious and super tasty! I can say I would recommend the turkey cranberry! We will be back for sure.
