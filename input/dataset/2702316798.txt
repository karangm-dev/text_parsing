Absolutely terrible service. Slow and generally confused waiters/waitresses. Mediocre sushi overall. Had a fresh taste but was poorly prepared and the pieces were very small. Not acceptable at these prices. Hibachi steak was fatty and of very poor quality. Scallops were almost paper thin. Terrible terrible terrible portion sizes. Overall an absolutely pitiful experience considering our check topped $100 for two people. You can get better for you money than this.
