I went in last week for the first time. I must say, the food at this location is hearty and the wait is short. I ordered an omelet and home fries and they were both delicious. If you're craving an All-American breakfast, you cannot go wrong here. The bacon strips are thick yet crispy so I recommend getting them if they aren't already included in your order. Though the prices are a bit more than affordable, it's well worth it and I plan to return here often.
