Honestly, this was a big disappointment. I have been eying this place for a long time and just finally decided to try it. In my opinion it was just a waste of money. I can say that the atmosphere is really cute, the food is hot and the service was good, but that's about it. My husband and I both got the burger baskets. The burgers were decent but nothing spectacular. They were juicy, but they lacked flavor and tasted just like a burger that anyone can make at home. The fries were pretty good though. The bacon on my husband's burger tasted sour like it was old. Maybe some of the other food is awesome, but for the high price I don't think I'll chance going back again.
