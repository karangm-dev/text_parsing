Dropped in last week and had a great experience! Yummy food with a fun twist. LOVED our blonde cocktail server. I'll remember to take pictures next time because I'll be back!Went back again our server was April again (got her name this time) I Had the Mixx Elyxx drink- my new favorite- thanks Phil! April recommended the rib cap it was AMAZING! Soon to be regulars this place is great!
