Yesterday my husband, daughter, and I went for a Sunday lunch around 2 pm. We walked in and there was 2 ladies in front of us ordering and then we were next in line. As we were ordering, a man came back in to the counter because he take out always wrong. The lady at the register did not seem to care and started to take my order again. All I had were two subs to order, chips, and drinks... However the lady was not friendly and took her good old time to ring me out. (By the way, it appeared she must have had a rough night because she was not pleasant, and was wearing what looked like pajama pants and slippers. Very odd and not a good imagine for a business). We sat down and it took an eternity for 2 sandwiches to be made. Finally when our name was called (couldn't hardly hear her when she called out names because she made it know she was having a day she didn't want to work) we finally got to eat. The subs tasted fine. However for the time it took and lack of crowd, and also for the poor customer service I will not return to this location. Thankfully there are others in Northeast Ohio!
