I walked across the country for 250 and stayed at countless amounts of hotels. This was one of the best hotels I stayed at! The room was ridiculously clean, very comfortable beds and plenty of room. The staff was kind and made me very pleased. The breakfast topped it off for me as they had a full buffet with anything you would expect at a hotel and more. All together it was a wonderful hotel and I would recommend it to anyone.
