I really wanted to like this place.  I ordered the Wonton Noodle Soup in hopes of curing a crucial hangover.  The soup was average.  A little too fatty for my taste - i could see a film of it floating on top!  I tried a bite of the Mongolian Beef dish, NOT GOOD.  Way too oily and tooooooo sweet.  The only semi decent dish I tried was the taro cake from the dim sum portion of the menu. Oh and don't even get me started on the service.  The waiter was soooo slow!!!  We asked for the check and 20 minutes later, got nothing.  I finally had to get up to find our waiter and even then, I STILL couldn't find him.   I had to ask a random waitress to get our check.  We could have pulled a dine and dash on his ass and he probably would be never have noticed.  Horrendous service and very overpriced for the quality of food.  Overall a bad experience.
