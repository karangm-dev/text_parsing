I tried this place today and wasn't sure how it was gonna be but glad I did,  this place isn't anything fancy or even true to be its a nice little diner with a nice full deli,  nice to see small businesses in the area and seems to do very well.  I had the breakfast burrito with a choice of meat inside it was huge,  very good. Nice service and I will definitely return to try other items so hard to choose the first time there.
