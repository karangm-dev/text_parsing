Used to be my Gold's gym of choice, but this location was already lacking in cardio equipment (compared to the amount of users) and they implemented this MMA style training area in the corner of already lacking gym. All this did was take away floor space which could've been used for more equipment etc. Parking can be tricky, and YOU WILL GET ANNOYED Exiting the Eastern exit off the 215fwy since traffic builds up at Serene. I suggest using the Gold's on Stephanie...3 miles farther, but because of the traffic on Eastern, it takes same amount of time to get to...might as well goto the better gym.
