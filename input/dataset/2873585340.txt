My Home Warranty company assigned them to me and i decided to look at Yelp just to see what  the ratings were. After reading all the negative reviews i was worried that i was going to have the same problem as everyone else. My dryer was making a loud noise and the roller was the main cause of it. Zhora was the technician and he seemed very knowledgeable regarding the problem and the solution to fix it. He also gave me a few tips to help prevent this or any other future problem from happening to my dryer. This company id call me on time and had me scheduled right away, the technician even gave me a courtesy call to ensure i was home. I don't if this was a fluke or maybe their company has better technicians now, but i am going to give this company 5 stars for this service call.  This has probably been the best experience i have had with any of my Home Warranty related service calls!
