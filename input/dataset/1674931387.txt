Today my husband waited for 2.5 HOURS past his scheduled appointment time to find out that the staff had misplaced his file and no one even knew he was there for a procedure. At my request, once he was finally called back into the clinic, the CT technician was unaware of what area he needed scanned and either was not provided with his referring Drs notes or did not read/ obtain the file because she was clueless as to all important information that should have been reviewed and known before the scan was started. This made an already difficult day worse than we could have ever imagined. I worry about the validity of the CT results and am very disappointed in the SimonMed staff. They were at best unprofessional, unorganized, and unprepared to do the job that they claim to be able to do.
