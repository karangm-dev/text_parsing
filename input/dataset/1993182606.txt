This one goes out to you Camilla and Jan of the floor department and the idiotic estimator you guys sent to my front door. If you have a quirky older home that your flipping, DO NOT USE RC WILEY FLOORING. Their sales people in store will sell grand stories of possibility and luxury, but alas their installers are committed to minimal work, and they will not work with you if there are cracks in your subfloor. Basically, I gave RC wiley 2,000 dollars and took out a $4,000 line of credit and they showed up day of install and refused to put the floors in because they were worried about cracks in my subfloor. I then got them to reevaluate and at least take my tile up to see how bad  it was and they balked again. My biggest complaint is why would you ever get this far in the process, if you guys are incapable of handling any sub flooring issues. THIS SHOULD BE THE FIRST THING OUT OF YOUR MOUTHS WHEN PEOPLE COME TO YOU ASKING FOR INSTALL. The direct consequences of RC Wiley refusing to instal 1) the line of credit I withdrew would make it impossible for me to get a low interest rate for another loan at a better company capable of installing floors.2) Due to them delaying and refusing to install my house was empty for longer than necessary and my house was broken into. 3) I will never shop at any RC Wiley ever, your furniture looks like last years Motel 8 anyway. -Also tell your sales rep who sent me business cards, "so i can recommend her to my friends and family," ya obviously thats not happening.
