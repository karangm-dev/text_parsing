An apartment locator recommended Camden Sotelo to me, along with other complexes. It was the first one I visited. I pretty much knew I would choose it immediately. I was warmly greeted by Alpha, who showed me the grounds, the apartment I would likely choose, and answered any questions I had. I especially liked the fact that the complex is dog-friendly.I moved in about a month and a half later and have felt quite at home. The management team is very efficient and responds quickly to service requests. Annalicia promptly notified Jasmine and Alvin about a few maintenance issues and it was no time before they took care of the issue. I'm looking forward to my stay here.
