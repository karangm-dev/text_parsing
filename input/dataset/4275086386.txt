This place has the legit true Mexico tacos. The spa ish rice is killer, the best around anywhere in Tempe! Try the chili rellenos..2 huge chilies stuffed with cheese and fried just right, RI e and beans included. Order extra red sauce to make it complete. I like the salsa bar as well. Hard to see from the street. Just look behind pet Club next to the drive in liquor store.
