Decent place, pretty good pizza. I ordered the tropical pizza with fresh mozzarella as well as the burrata with melon and a beer. The burrata was not what I was expecting; definitely not worth the $12 for it. My beer glass had white stains on it from not being dried properly. But overall, nice staff and decent setup. You order your pizza first and are rung up for it and then order your drinks. Probably won't come back here but recommend coming once.
