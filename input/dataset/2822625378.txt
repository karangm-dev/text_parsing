Wowza! I love this place. After years of driving past Pepe's we finally stopped in ...on you guessed...yup..right on Taco Tuesday. How was it? Sooooo goooood. The chips and salsa are made in house and you'll for sure get tears from that salsa. The tacos are huge and insane delicious and you can choose soft or crispy. Crispy baby!! So good...so so so good. For $1 you really get your buck's worth. Oh but just wait until you taste the green corn tamales. I am such a sucker for these green chiles. Come to mama you hot tamale!! So darn good that I had to take some home. We brought a group of friends here and they all agreed how damn good it is. Pepe's has 4 new customers. Definitely coming back. We'll all be there. Like. Next Tuesday.
