It had been a while since we were there but the place is still great. A hidden gem of a restaurant that everyone should try. The food is still wonderful. The filet was perfect as was my husband's prime rib. The cheesy bread and ranch potatoes are not to be missed. The service is always courteous and friendly. We were seated immediately and served quickly. We always love the rustic decor. Nothing fancy but we aren't there for the decor. We recommend the place to all of our friends. Just like some other places in Las Vegas, it's like a time capsule of the way dining should be- great food and excellent service.
