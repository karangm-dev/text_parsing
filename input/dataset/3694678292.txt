I recently went to this location and ordered the chicken rice bowl. Later that night I started to feel not so good. This was the only thing I had eaten that day so I know food poisoning when it happens. I spoke to a friend of mine who had chicken tacos and he also told he had gotten food poisoning also. I would say stay clear from the chicken !!
