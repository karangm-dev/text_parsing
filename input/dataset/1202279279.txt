My favorite park in Vegas! Aside from the fact that it's the closest to me, I LOVE all the green here (out on the ground floor) and there's a hill that you can hike up and work out your lazy selves (like me).It's also a good place for kids with the playground and it's really nice to just have a stroll here and just talk with your friends. The view is also nice at the top.. especially at night when Vegas is alit with the Strip's lights.
