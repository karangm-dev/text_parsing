I came in the other day and as I was walking In I noticed all 3 hosts sitting there gossiping and I came up and told one of them politely I was there for take out. The host replied with total attitude and said "uhh it's at the bar!" Needless to say I was thrown back. Please tell me how I am supposed to know where take out is. Well when I got to take out the girl was awesome but as I was leaving the hostess were all 3 sitting there gossiping once again and as I was walking out never got a good bye or thank you have a great day. I've been hosting for over a few years now and this is definitely a problem. I figure Olive Garden hires for looks only.
