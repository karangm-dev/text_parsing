my kind of bar.   Incognito, curious and fun.   I always feel like I've been pleasantly finger f****ed after I go to sidebar.  The drinks are amazing the atmosphere is cosmic.  A place good straight and gay friends can both feel at ease and enjoy the night.  now the music is ultimately awesome.  I think the bar tender selects the music.   Anywho,  5 stars and five dollars for sure.
