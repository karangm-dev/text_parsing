I've had a phobia with dentists since I was a child. I was referred to Dr. Sharma from a colleague. I went in for an exam and they had a $49 special for an exam and a cleaning.  The receptionist was very friendly and my hygienist, Josselyn, was gentle and did a good job cleaning my teeth. Dr Sharma was informative and polite, unfortunately I  had a large cavity that needed a crown. Dr Sharma said that they would be able to do the crown in one visit. The staff showed me a demonstration how the crowns are made. When I returned for the crown, I was there for a couple hours but left with my cavity fixed and a crown. Overall I had a good experience and will be returning for cleanings. I would recommend Dr Sharma and her team to anyone who is in need of a trusting, affordable  dentist.
