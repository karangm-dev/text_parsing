You have to be really careful with Allegiant Air. What looks like a cheap flight begins to grow and grow from fees and fees and more fees.  Even with all the fees and addons my total price was still a bit cheaper than the major airlines. Gotta read all the fine print. I thought I was getting a great price on adding a car rental, but I got charged both from Allegiant and from Enterprise. Allegiant said the enterprise charge was just the taxes ($80). Could have gotten the rental cheaper had I gone through Enterprise.  My local regional airport also didn't have any restaurants and the bathroom was a large porta-potty and had to walk in the rain to get to it. Every little snack, except water has a price.  Gotta be careful and realize what you will get for what price.
