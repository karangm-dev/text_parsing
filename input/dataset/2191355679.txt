I find it super unprofessional and rude for Dena the cashier with prison tattoos all over her face and neck to tell me that I ordered incorrectly. I asked for a number ten medium spicy nuggets. And she comes back with you didn't order that correctly you need to clarify if you're getting spicy first cause you just messed me up . Really!!??? Learn how to to do your job !!!! As a customer how do I know that's how your system works
