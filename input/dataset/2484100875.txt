I was in the area on a business trip a few weeks ago where I ordered through DoorDash. The butter chicken masala was amazing and the butter naan was fresh and flavorable! Sadly enough, tonight I decided to venture to the restaurant to order since business has brought me back to the area. My experience with the food was horrible, thus the reason for this review.Where do I begin? Let me first say that this negative review is because of the fact that I feel cheated as a customer. This is an attempt to put out there that as customers, our business should be appreciated and the honesty in the freshness of a meal is expected from a restaurant. Tonight, when I left the restaurant and ventured back to my hotel to try the food, the butter naan appeared as though it was microwaved. It was not fresh, it was not hot, it had no bits of crisp that it should have when it's out of the tandoor. The butter chicken...I had to fish for the small chicken pieces in the masala! Smaller bits of chicken that tasted as though it was left over from the lunch buffet. The only thing fresh of my meal was the veg samosa because it's the one thing that actually has to be fresh, otherwise it's highly noticeable. What isn't noticeable is the fact that I have ethnic roots to this food but based off appearance one may think otherwise. I believe that going into the restaurant to order take out tonight was a mistake. Considering one main butter chicken, naan, and a veg samosa amounts to $25 is a bit expensive. As customers we should be receiving fresh food and not fooled and definitely not disrespected with being served reheated food. Giving it a one star review because their butter chicken is actually pretty good if it's good amounts of chicken and fresh. I however will no longer order and felt entitled to share my experience.
