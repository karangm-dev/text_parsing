I had Auto Glass Now replace my windshield about a month ago. They came out same day and replaced it in about an hour. The work was good. A few weeks later a rock flew up from the highway and cracked the windshield in the line of visibility. I figured I would use them again based on my first experience. Here's what happened. Called Saturday 3/26 - Gentleman said they're too busy to get to me until Monday. No big deal, I'll call back and reschedule. Monday 3/28 - Woman said they will be at my house by 5:00 PM to replace. After leaving work early and making sure I am home for these guys...I wait...and wait...and wait. Until I get a call at 6:15 PM saying they're too busy today and the girl who answered the phone doesn't know what she's talking about and shouldn't have booked me. Okay...no big deal let's reschedule. He then assured me he would be at my home the next day, 3/29, by 5:00 PM. So, again, I leave work early to make sure I am there...and I wait....and wait...and wait. And NOBODY shows up. NOBODY calls. Nothing. So at 6:30 PM I call the business only to get an answering service and she said "sorry they're closed you need to call back tomorrow." Okay, now I am irritated. I send an email that night (3/29): "I had an appointment for Monday at 5 pm only to get a call at 6 saying he could no longer do it. Understand. Made another appt for today at 5 pm...no call...no show...Seriously?"Can you guess how they responded? You're right...THEY DIDN'T RESPOND AT ALL. I would advise that you just go with Safelite. They might take a little longer for an appointment but I guarantee you they're not going to lie to you, ignore you, and blatantly blow you off. If you value your time don't give this place any consideration.
