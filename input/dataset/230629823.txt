My daughter-in-law found this place looking for farm to table restaurant and found this. Not only is the decor perfect the service was wonderful. There were six of us and everyone loved their food. I had the seared ahi salad and I loved it. If I ever go back to Las Vegas I will definitely come back here. It was by far my favorite meal.
