This place is AMAZING FOR FAMILIES. The admission is $12 per person it seems pricey but with the new upgrades and the amenities that they offer it is well worth it. I was there with my 6 year old and she loved it. There is a HUGE jungle gym that she spent a ton of time on with the other kids as there are different ways to climb all over it. She spent a little time with the building blocks as you can build a car with walls different seats all kinds of different things. The options are endless with the building blocks and other building toys.  The water room is probably the best thing and my daughter had the most fun in there. There are tons of things to do in there as water ball towers, playing house washing dishes, making fountains and using balls to see how a vortex works. It is all chlorinated so it is nice  and clean and don't have to work about any illnesses with kids. The art room was also a very cool thing to do before we left to wind down the day. A great experience to say the least.
