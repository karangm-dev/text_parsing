Worst. Casino. Ever. 90% of their staff are the rudest people I've had the displeasure of encountering. They request the silliest of forms with your ID for verification (a W-9, really?) and will throw you out and/or hang up on you for asking a question about it. That's just security. Box office? Just as bad. Choose ANY casino in AZ over this one and you'll have a better experience.
