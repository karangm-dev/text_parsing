Going in with bronchitis and coming out feeling like a million bucks?! I'm sold!  The rare beef + Tendon phò was phenom! The pho base is really outta this world! I enjoyed every last sip! Shoulda probably got some more soup for tonight!  We also bought the Pad Thai, and again, pretty darn good! I'm used to more egg and some lime, but that's just a personal thing. Next time, I'll try a "2" on the heat scale.We'll beh back for phò brah!
