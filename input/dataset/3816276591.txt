My husband set up the reservation for this company. They were supposed to show up between 8-10 am. They called and said it would be 11 which was okay. At noon I called and was told they would be at the location in 20 minutes. They did not arrive until 1:20. It then took them four hours to load the truck and placed them in the middle of rush hour. They did not change Miley's the project until 10 pm, I was told this would be a 2-3 hour job. They also damaged my house. Do not use this company. These are the worst people you could deal with. They are refusing my calls and emails, but damn sure they took my money.
