My family and I decided to try this new restaurant that opened up November 2015.  This is a very friendly restaurant where everyone is greeted when they walk in.  My husband tried the sausage biscuits and gravy which he stated were very good and fresh. I tried the build your own omelette which was so good my granddaughter wanted to try it.  Nope not sharing.  My granddaughter got a children's pancake that she loved.  Now my son who is a very good cook got eggs poached along with his chicken fried steak said they were cooked perfectly.  So the best part besides how great the food and staff are is their pricing.  Come on in and try them out
