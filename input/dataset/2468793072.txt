Not sure why I switched cable companies.  Totally disappointed so far!  TV delays while changing the channels, extra hidden costs, additional one time fees never disclosed.  Free for a year-NO charged $15.99 for HBO.  They installed a modem!  A modern?  Who used that anymore.  Called switched it out the next day, now I have an additional $7.00 fee.  Not recommending it at all.  I will be contacting customer service on Tuesday.
