as this has been my first time with a chiro, i really have nothing to compare it to, but i have been so pleasantly surprised with the customer service and the results that i'm showering CAS chiropractic with 5 stars.  they must only hire the friendliest people in phoenix (seriously, not the nicest town, but these folks are MINNESOTA nice.)  they all know my name, where i'm from, and what i do (and ask about such things!) after only a few visits.  my hips feel much better while running, and i can do the elliptical without my feet going numb (a big plus, because that's generally pretty disconcerting).  BRAVO CAS chiropractic!
