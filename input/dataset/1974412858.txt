I've been up and down Eastern Ave to try all the sushi places and this one is my favorite.  The restaurant has a nice ambiance and all the staff are pleasant and friendly.  The food is excellent. It's a bit disconcerting, there is usually only a table or two there, and it appears dark from the outside, but it's really very nice and delicious!
