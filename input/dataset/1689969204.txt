We stopped in Friday night to grab a drink before dinner and running some errands at the mall.  I absolutely love this gem of a bar - great atmosphere (cozy, but comfortable), amazing service and great beer and wine selection = a winning combination!  This would definitely be our "go to" bar if we lived in Old Town Scottsdale.
