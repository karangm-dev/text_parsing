I found the decor and ambience to be quite pleasant. The virtual art across behind the car streaming snippets of old French films! The presentation of the food was original and artistic ( we had the Tour de France cheese platter, oysters & mussels). Drinks were average - I have had way better old fashioneds for a whiskey lover. Although the bubbly was great by the glass.This place was over-priced but I am glad I checked it out!
