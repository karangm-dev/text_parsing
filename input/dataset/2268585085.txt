Yet another example of a business cashing in on location at the expense of quality. Cocktails are chain-restaurant worthy, wine list is weak, and seafood is only barely competently prepared. Calamari was good. Worth it, served with a large pool (at least 2 cups) of seasoned mayo. Lobster roll was rubbery and tasteless. The bun was exceptional however. The salmon was Kirkland's best, and "crusted with pecans"=sprinkled.  Hmm. The grouper sandwiches were passable. McCain fries. Yum. The day was sunny. The company was excellent. I noted the The Pump ouse Grill on Lakeshore. I'll park there next time and enjoy the wings.
