I think I hate this place. Tried to pick up a quick meal tonight. It's always overcrowded and the line moves at a tortoise pace. I feel surrounded by a bunch of impatient and hungry college kids. The line moved so slow tonight that people were waiting outside....IN THE RAIN....just for a dumb burrito. That lasted about 1 minute for me and I left. UGH!Don't order the chips. They are always stale!
