Im obsessed with this place! Best dishes to try include: Pozole- which is really filling! Great for when is freezing outside.... Tacos dorados- they are the best ones I have tried in the city! Enchiladas during the morning on weekends are the best as well, delicious! And if you really want to try real huevos rancheros try them here!!!!! There are some other places in the neighbourhood to claim to offer them and trust me none of the are authentic as they are here. Always a great experience, keep the good work! Prices are so good also considering the freshness and quality of food, one of the best places to eat without breaking your pocket.
