I can not say enough great things about this venue and all of their coordinators and employees. They were so accommodating and easy going they really kept me stress free. Anytime I turned around they were there to help with smiles on their faces. Having the space from Wednesday-Monday, what a dream! I completely made it my own and it was beyond anything I could have ever imagined. My guest were blown away! Kathy and Megan are a dream team to coordinate and work with. Gary,Dave,James,and Dan a real pleasure to work with and reliable hard working men. The entire week of my wedding and night of even allowing us to stay later than a usual wedding being NYE went off without any problems from the venue. Thank you all so much for all your hard work and smiling faces.
