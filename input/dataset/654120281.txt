My wife and I have been to Skye numerous times (10-12). The food is excellent, and the wine has always been reasonably priced.We always enjoy the musical accompaniment that Dan provides. It truly adds to the experience. This gem is a solid 4-5 stars. The reviews that drag it down are from sometime ago - before we began frequenting the restaurant. Lastly, we have taken our teenage children to Skye, because we wanted them to experience the food/live music combo, and they really enjoyed themselves.It's our favourite Mentor restaurant.
