We traveled in to Calgary and hosted a corporate dinner here... buffet style BBQ for 35 people. We sat outside on the patio and the vibe was great, our server Irene was excellent and had no trouble keeping up with a group of our size. Noelle and Jared who helped organize the event were very helpful and the food was delicious! We had a spread of ribs, brisket, pulled pork, sweet potato mash, black eyed peas, slaw, Mac and cheese and BBQ chicken. Everyone left happy and full! They also had live music which a few of our guests stayed for and really enjoyed. I was a bit nervous having planned the event from the US based on internet research but overall it was a great experience and if in Calgary I would def recommend checking them out!
