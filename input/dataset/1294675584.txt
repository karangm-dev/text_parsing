When I had my inspection done by Chris Hall he made me feel like he was buying the house his self. I really enjoyed his conversation and his vast knowledge that he shared with my wife and I. I would recommend Home Pride Inspections to everyone! I am in the Air Force and have lived in 4 different countries and lived in 9 different states, I have bought 3 houses and I have never had an inspector care so much about a house that was not even his. Thank you Chris! 5 Stars is not enough for this company.
