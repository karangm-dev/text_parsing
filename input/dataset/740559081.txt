I've been here quite a few times and I ALWAYS end up getting breakfast. Fresh, perfect flavors and priced right are three ways to sum up Bertha's Cafe. The breakfast wrap with tomatoes, eggs, bacon, avocado and grilled balsamic onions is so good I don't have appropriate words. You always get a little surprise order of bananas, honey and oats with each breakfast purchase for FREE!! Do yourself a favor and try it out.
