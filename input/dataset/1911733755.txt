Okay I haven't been here in a few years since ive moved back to San Francisco but still wanted to send a review to this awesome place. I've taken my 2002 Volvo at the time here a few times when I had issues and I've never felt ripped off or taken advantage of. They were always communtive and courtesy. Also one point my family drove to Vegas in a 2000 jeep which broke down at baker. Luckily there was a 2nd car used to make it to Vegas. My moms ins company didn't help & the baker mechanic was horrible. So it was left over night but I gave my mom the # for imperial and they helped so much! Went above and beyond and fixed it before they left to return back home. Amazing service !
