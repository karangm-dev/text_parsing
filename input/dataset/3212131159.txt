Took my '10 Tacoma over there earlier. Not a sophisticated looking place. Hot rods and classics all around. No lasers - all old school. Cash or check only. Also, no appointments. There's a clipboard you sign in on, and he does them in order (although he will call when done if you drop off).Have to say that Gary is very thorough. He drives it, works on it, drives it again to double-check, and tweaks it if it isn't just perfect. The Taco definitely seems to be aligned correctly, and drives good.  Read other reviews that say he seems like he ignores you.  True, he stays focused on his work and isn't much of a talker, but I think the clipboard is his version of automated check-in.  He's not real pricey either.- which is getting rare nowadays. I highly recommend Gary's!
