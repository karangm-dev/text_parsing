I hate going to chain hair salons.  First of all, I don't have a "fashionable" hair style.  I usually just shave my hair at home.  But sometimes I like to keep it a little longer.  When I do, I have it parted on the side and combed over.  I have hair that does not take to styling very well.  And I am losing it on top.  When I want a haircut (I've had 3 real haircuts in 9 years of living in Vegas) I want it cleaned up around the back and ears and trimmed on top leaving it just long enough to continue combing.  What I from Great Clips was quick service from a lady who made no small talk at all.  This does not necessarily bother me.  I am not one for small talk any how.  It just seemed very impersonal.  She cleaned up the back just frine from what I can tell.  She messed up around the ears.  The left side is trimmed higher than the right.  I feel off balance every time I look in the mirror.  The top was not trimmed much leaving that unsightly cowlick to deal with still even though I told her I wanted it gone.  She also asked me if I wanted to keep the side burns.  Considering I have a full face beard that is connected to my head by side burns it seemed like a stupid question.  Of course I would like to keep what ties it all together.  I would look pretty stupid otherwise.  This is exactly why I cut my own hair most times.  If I need a real haircut I think I will try to find an old fashioned neighborhood barber.  At least they may not butcher my hiar and charge me up the whazoo for it.
