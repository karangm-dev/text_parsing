Well...Made an impulsive appointment last winter with 'Jae'.  Nice enough, but she pushed product my way though and the products that she used on my hair did not improve the look, feel of my hair, so the cut did not look very good!  The blow out wasn't good either.  My hair was not smooth and looked dry.  I had to go home and recondition and style again.  The cut was a basic 'take an inch off' and she didn't touch my side bangs...which needed a little blending.
