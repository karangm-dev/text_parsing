It's been about two weeks since Omar did my window tint. It looks great, he had to scrap off old nasty window tint that started to bubble. The work they do is awesome, this is the 3rd vehicle he has done for me. I've been very happy every time. I'll for sure always keep my business with him. Prices are fair, but the quality and professional service speaks for itself.  Thanks Omar
