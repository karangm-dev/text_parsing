This probably the smallest and most uncomfortable airlines I have ever flown with. The prices are dirt cheap but you get what you pay for. They are usually delayed. When they're not delayed they leave the port five minutes prior to take off time. They do not care about customer service but rather the money. If you can pay for another airline than do so but if you're looking for a quick getaway with minimal cost book away.
