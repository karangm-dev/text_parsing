I purchased a few items with no issues. However the one star rating is because I went there TWICE to purchase a mattress. Both times, with two different sales people, they were clearly not interested in helping us. Walked out both times amazed at the lack of customer service and went elsewhere and made the purchase. Have no desire to ever go back for anything ever again. Customer service ranks high with me.
