This is our Friday night dinner spot.  Great food and great service.  We seem to always eat late with the kids when we go and there is never a wait.  We have not been let down once.  The entire menu is great.  Dining room is cutoff from the bar so you wont choke on smoke and therefore makes it fine for kids.
