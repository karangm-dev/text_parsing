Mike and his crew did a very good job on our backyard waterfall. I waterfall is about 20 years old and had a lot of cracks and was leaking water. We also had part of a palm tree growing out of the stonework. He was very knowledgeable and experienced. Prompt to the minute! And we felt he did a very good job with his crew. He was on site most of the time for the job and  would highly recommend using again.
