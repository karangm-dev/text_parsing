This place is pretty mediocre and over priced. It's not a high end restaurant but is priced like one. The food was good but our waitress was rude. Their debit and credit machines were not working and when we told the waitress we did not have cash she gave us attitude because she would manually have to charge our cards. Will not be returning.
