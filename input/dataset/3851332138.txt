Drew and his crew are just amazing!! They accommodated my in-laws diet restrictions. Drew specifically made her dish which called for dairy free, gluten free! Maggie loved her pasta with chicken and asparagus! At the end TJ presented her with her very own dessert, which is a small bowl of fresh fruits and berries! That made their 60th wedding anniversary the more unforgettable! Drew also made me shrimp fettuccine alfredo (which was not available that night!). All i can say is it's better than Olive Garden!! Thank you Drew! Since we were so happy, delighted and satisfied with his personal touch, we have reserved a party of 27 for September! Our family from Texas, Washington, Oregon, Oklahoma cannot wait!!Thanks Drew and Crew!!
