After a couple hiccups, we finally brought home our first Travel Trailer. We settled on the "Imagine" from Grand Design (thanks to my wife's great taste). Blue Dog RV went ABOVE & BEYOND  to make sure we were satisfied. A huge thanks to Derek Yamamoto in Sales. Responsive, attentive, professional, these are just a few descriptors of his character.  Derek went the extra mile!To Brian & his team in Service & PDI. His team NEVER gave up despite several challenges with our unique tow vehicle. Shout out to George for our walk through also. GREAT TEAM @ Blue Dog Las Vegas. THANKS from our family to YOURS!!
