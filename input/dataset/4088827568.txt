I come here quite a bit it use to be really dirty and very noisy with no play ground now it is remodeled and they got rid of all access to any electrical outlets.  This tells me that they really don't want costumers to stay at all so it defeats having a dine in area. And it seems that they want to loose even more employees than they already have.  And even with the new tile it still looks dirty.
