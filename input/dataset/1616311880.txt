When the craving hits and china town is too far away. Finding a good banh mi sandwich is hit and miss but this place is spot on. Always clean , friendly staff and good food.  Also the portions are awesome lots of meat in the sandwiches, bread is always fresh. Great prices for students and hungry folks on a budget.
