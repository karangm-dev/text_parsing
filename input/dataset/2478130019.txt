this really is what retail food should be like. a great shop, that curates there selection based on what they really should be selling. you will not find anything here that is not super high quality, and the staff are incredible.  some very rare finds here, and an ever expanding portfolio of wonderful oddities. they also serve possibly the best grilled cheese around, wrapped in butcher paper and soaking through with amazingness. its a two napkin situation for sure. its true what some have sad that the staff are really hot. like really hot. milk must do a body good, especially went its cultured as these beautiful people really are.
