We've been going to Palm Valley for about 10 years now and have nothing but good things to say. They are always responsive and courteous and I really trust them with my dogs. We just got a new puppy and found out she has worms and an abundance of ticks. I called first thing in the morning and had an appointment for the same day just a few hours later. They safely removed all of the ticks and got her started right away on a dewormer. I wish my regular family physician was this good! :)
