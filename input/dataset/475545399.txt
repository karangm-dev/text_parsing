Folks,  check you bill thoroughly at the time of rental.   When I got to the rental agency I was asked "how many in your party"?  "How much luggage"?  The agent said "I have an Elantra for you"  I had booked  a compact car but was charged for an upgrade to a Standard car.  An upgrade I didn't request and was not told there would be an additional charge.When I returned the vehicle I asked about the extra charge.  I was told I had upgraded.  Spoke with the manager and told him I didn't request an upgrade, that the Elantra was what I was given.  After arguing for a while they said they would listen to the recordings.  Two days latter I get an e-mail saying they will credit my card.  Two weeks have gone by and no credit to my card.  Hertz was contacted and I was told it would take 1 or 2 business cycles.  So, I will be waiting for my credit for 2 months?
