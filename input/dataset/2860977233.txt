Happy 1st Burstday! You have made my return back to Charlotte more fun and filled with delicious food! Nikki you had some big shoes to fill and you have done an amazing job. You have been able to throw one of the best yelper parties I have ever attended and hosting several fun and different elite events all over our lovely city. I hope you stick around Charlotte for a few more years at least! I'm glad Colin ventured out to Huntersville to celebrate, turns out it wasn't as far away as I thought. Big thanks to Pinky's Westside Grill of Huntersville. The staff was super attentive! The signature drinks were delish. Big Thanks to Salior Jerry & Sierra Nevada. Fried food galore!! Those pickles and fried artichokes were so good, I may have gone up for 3 plates, just saying!  I need to stop this review because I'm getting too hungry for 11am! Great Job Nikki & thanks Pinky's for hosting
