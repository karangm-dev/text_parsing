The service was fast, courtesy, and knowledgeable! The space was beautiful! Set in a restored turn of the century home in Cleveland's Eastside on Larchmere Blvd. The menu was just the right size and had a little bit of something for everyone. Everything on the menu sounded delicious! For my entree I had the Seared Salmon Special, perfectly prepared! Well-seasoned crispy surface and absolutely flavorful moist center! I ate everything off my plate, it looked like I licked it clean. The cocktail list was short with ahhhh-mazingly creative cocktails. I had the Lemon Jenny and it was delicious, a perfect mix of sweet, sour, and refreshing. They also had a very good wine and beer list.Felice is a dinning experience must for anyone wanting something off the beaten path. It has a blend of urban, earthy, casual, luxe - hard to explain but, it's different in an extremely good way. I will definitely be back.Tip: There's only street parking here so get here with time to find parking.
