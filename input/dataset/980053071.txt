First off you get a huge portion of Roasted Pork, BBQ Pork, veggies and a whopping serving of rice.  Plus you get a side order of soup/broth.  All this for $5.50. BEST DEAL IN TOWN!!!!  Honestly, you can get half and save the other half for later so really, it's like two meals for $2.75 per meal.The decor looks awful and Im afraid to even go to their bathroon but who cares cause the food and the price is like from 1980.
