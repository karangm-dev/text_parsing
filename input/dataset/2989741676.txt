Love this place.   All the food tasted authentic, the pancakes had actual maple syrup, and the hash browns were cooked in butter.  My omelette was very good as far as ingredients, it was a little dry, I think some more cheese could have solved that problem.  Orange juice was fresh squeezed.  Staff is super attentive and quick to seat you.  My only issue was I wish there was more choices.  Matt's is on my top 3 breakfast places, can't wait to go back!
