I've ordered from here numerous times. The burgers are great and quite a bit larger than most other places. However, my latest order on Foodora was a mess.  To be clear, the burgers were of the usual high quality.  But, instead of being wrapped in paper or foil, each burger arrived in a cardboard box of the type used for poutine or kimchi fries.  Obviously, the large boxes failed to keep the burgers from falling apart and everything was a soggy condiments covered mess.  I didn't order "deconstructed" burgers. Not cool!
