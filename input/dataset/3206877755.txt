ALFRED, JAZMINE, ALI, and NINA POLLERA...THESE ARE THE NAMES OF THE EMPLOYEES WHO TOOK PART IN THE HORRIBLE SERVICE TO MY SISTER! DO NOT..I repeat..DO NOT RENT WITH THIS PLACE!! We booked from Hotwire and while the prices are cheap it is DEFINITELY TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!1. ALFRED FAILED TO DISCLOSE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION ABOUT ADDING A DRIVER, my sister then had extra fees added TO THE CONTRACT WHILE MY SISTER WAS THE ONLY ONE DRIVING. 2. JAZMINE was also very unhelpful. My sister asked to speak to her superior, AND SHE TOLD HER TO CALL THE CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER! WTF?? I'm pretty sure a 1-800 number is not your supervisor.3. ALI, probably the WORST of them all! Ali proceeded to tell my sister that there is no way Alfred could not have done his job correctly, therefore implying we were liars, which I confronted him about and he suddenly got very defensive and unprofessional with a very stank attitude. At this point he is arguing back and forth with us and finally gets his supervisor Nina.4. NINA, comes out and my sister is explaining once again what the issue is, and all Nina could say was there was nothing she could do! However, CUSTOMER SERVICE 101, NEVER SAY YOU CANT DO ANYTHING! She also had a look on her face as of saying "haha we scammed you of your money, now go away"! My sister will be disputing this further, no doubt!But in the mean time, DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY!! They will scam you and give you the worst customer service EVER! This company has LOW/NO stars for a reason!!Save yourselves the headache! They do not clearly disclose fees.You're welcome for warning you and saving you the horrible experience ahead of time!Don't forget to check ratings on consumeraffairs.com and the BBB. You will find that this company already has a BAD BAD BAD reputation.
