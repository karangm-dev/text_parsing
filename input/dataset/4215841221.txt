Nice staff, but ugg on the unimpressive food. Tried 3 things from the menu & gave all to the person I was with. The portions are ridiculously small - steak skewers = 2 small skewers (maybe 10 bites) for $13 - not cool.Best tip about this place: works for drinks (they have a bloody mary bar on the weekends) but no way would I go here again for food.
