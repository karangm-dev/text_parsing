Really great dumplings and flavor! I ordered the boiled pork, shrimp and cabbage, fried shrimp and vegetable dumplings, and garlic eggplant. The fried shrimp and vegetable dumpling was perfect and delicious. The boiled pork, shrimp and cabbage were a little bit salty but didn't bother me too much. The garlic eggplant was one of the best I had. The prices are reasonable and they were really nice to accommodate delivering outside of their zone for me! Would definitely be ordering again in the near future!
