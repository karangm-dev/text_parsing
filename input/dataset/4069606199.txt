My wife who has been here several times for breakfast wanted to take me here for lunch because she noticed the tongue sandwich on the menu a real favorite of mine. We showed up around noon time on a Friday afternoon and the place was packed but were seated within ten minutes. My wife ordered a Reuben and I ordered the tongue tip. Our waitress returned a bit later to tell me they were out of tongue tip and regular tongue. I asked if this was normal and she couldn't really say. I settled on a philly cheese steak. All I can say is both sandwiches were a disappointment. Small servings and the philly might have just been two pieces of bread and a sprinkling of meat. Onions, peppers, cheese?  To beat it all on our way out we saw a sign on the door that said this is a place of peace no firearms. When will people learn that criminals don't read or care about signs. My wife and I were both armed and managed to get through our sub par meal without disturbing anyone. Armed citizens are a deterrent to crime and not a danger. If you want to prevent lawful CCW post your sign better. As per the law. I guess I'll never get to find out about that tongue sandwich now. Bummer!
