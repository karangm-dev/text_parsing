I was a fairly long-term customer. Used them for maybe 2 years.A few notes on my experience:1 - In the beginning, they were fairly accommodating with my last-minute schedule.2 - $20/hour is a good rateTwo of my last experiences with them were as follows, which is why I am no longer a customer:1 - I booked an appointment, the time came the next day, no one showed up. After some back-and-forth with Anna, it was revealed that the cleaner had some emergency and did not give any notice they wouldn't be coming.2 - I booked an appointment on a Wednesday for a Friday. Explicitly confirmed on Weds that Fri is good. Called on Thursday to confirm, was told yes, we are on schedule. Friday came, no one showed up. After waiting 30-40 min, called to see what the problem is, was told there was a computer problem, and they did not schedule my appointment correctly.  When I expressed my frustration, I was told that I had to understand that they had a computer problem.
