This is definitely our new favorite Thai place in summerlin! It's a really small place but we came at 6 on a Saturday and didn't have to wait for a table. My husband got a basil chicken stir fry and I got chicken pad Thai, both at a level 6 which is what we get at every thai place we ever go to. WOW, definitely made a note for next time - the 6 felt like an 8!! Very spicy, so keep that in mind. Other than that, the food was super fresh and flavorful. Our server was so nice and attentive, we really liked her! Can't wait to come back. Highly recommend.
