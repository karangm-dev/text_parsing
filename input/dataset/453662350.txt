Want a 'traditional' car buying experience?  Then this is the place for you.  Salesman becomes your long lost friend and helps you do battle with the suits behind the door.  Good cop - bad cop model.  We had taken our 2 Hyundai for service  to this dealership for three years.  Service was great.  No complaints.  But when it came time for a new car they treated us like strangers off the street.  Low balled me by at least $1000 on trade in and wanted $2000 more than sticker price for new car.  Asked for their best offer and they just moved numbers from one column to another.  Bottom line stayed the same.  As we are leaving, we questioned the sales price being $2000 more than sticker price and sales man retrieved paper from floor of car that had price $3000 more than sticker.  He tried to explain their offer as being $1000 less than that number while we pointed out it was $2000 more than the sticker, impasse.  Got home and got call from guy identifying himself as customer service rep asking me about my experience but call quickly turned to sales call.Went to another dealer and got deal I wanted without the dance.  Original deal from second dealer was $3000 less than final from Earnhardt.  Note for service department here.  We were your loyal customers for three years and you guys did a great job.  Traditional business model for car dealership has service department subsidizing sales.  You guys financially support the pretty boys up front.  You get the grease on your hands while they keep their nails clean and manicured.  Well, they just screwed you out of two customers.  Maybe they should take a pay cut for undermining the business.
