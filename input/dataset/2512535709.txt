I love this place!!! great service, affordable, friendly and professional! I had my Jazz spayed and we both were very nervous. Lisa talked me through the entire process when making the appointment, I knew what to expect; when Jazz came home I was confident in how to care for her after the surgery. 14 days later she is back to normal! I highly recommend this clinic.
