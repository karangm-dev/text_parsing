My wife wants to go trail riding with a girlfriend.  Last week she took Horsemanship 101 and then followed it up a few days later with a 90 minute private lesson.  Robert is a perfect guide and she not only learned about horses and riding but about the rich history of the people, the Gila River Indians.  What a treat and she is going back again.  Very well done.  Highly recommended.
