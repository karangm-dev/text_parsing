Don't waste your time.  I contacted Tip Top Trough July 11 and it took them weeks to set up an appointment (July 25).  On the day of the appointment I took time off work to meet with Pierce based on a 4 hour window (10-2).  Despite being home the entire time, Pierce never showed.  I called Myriam and she explained that he had come to our house, knocked on the door and no one had answered.  What is interesting is that I have a fully functional door bell (happily tested by Jehovah's Witnesses that very morning within the 4 hr window) and the company also has my phone number.  Astounds me that Pierce "showed up" and left without even trying to either ring the doorbell or call me.  Their customer service skills are non-existent.
