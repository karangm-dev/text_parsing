We were a group of 8, in last night to celebrate a friend's birthday. Definitely a weird experience anchored by really confusing service and hit and miss food. I'll just itemize some things we endured:- we had two servers, one was decent, the other seemed to really not want to be there and could barely contain her contempt;- Food and drinks removed from the table when people weren't finished eating and drinking;- half-assed table maintenance so we were often holding used plates so they could put entrees down;- Some food orders not relayed to kitchen;- Requests ignored or only half completed;- Generally rude interactions - ie) constantly interrupting conversations; constantly reaching across people to grab plates and leaning over people's food with her hair practically brushing all the food and drinks; physically poking us to get our attention when we were eating or in conversation;- Spilling beer on me and then simply giving a cursory 'sorry' and walking away. A napkin would have been appreciated since our table had been completely cleared already, but it's ok I can air dry. Food-wise our calamari was soggy and slimy, but they remade it. My steak was good - well cooked and well seasoned, so that's something.The management comped a couple bottles of wine for us which was nice of them. Not sure what the deal was with our server last night, but this just shows how one person can really ruin an experience. Will probably not be back.
