The Worst PEDICURE Of My life. My 11 year old daughter gives a better pedicure. The woman would not stop talking. She cut my skin around my toes. Cut my nails into the corners,  I'll probably have an ingrown toenail. I have about 20 layers of polish and they still look aweful. Worst experience. Completely uncomfortable. Nothing relaxing whatsoever.
