A favorite amongst my girlfriends and family. Fantastic authentic made from scratch menu in an intimate location. Excellent service. Feel like family while dining. Unpretentious. Owners are a delight. It's a neighborhood secret. An absolute delight. One that shows its value and quality by withstanding the test of time. I am obsessed with their Parmesan style dishes and tortellini. I have trouble deciding between the Chicken Parmesan and Eggplant Parmesan. Not a lot of places do Eggplant right, so when you do find it house made done correctly it's a must.  And then there is the Tortellini in the red pepper sauce. Oh. My. Goodness. Wow. I could drink the sauce. If they served it up in a wine glass, I'd shamelessly indulge. It's THAT good. Friends and family have said their rack of lamb and half rack are a must order. (I'm not a lamb eater) I can say that I don't even like Chicken Masala but I do like theirs. That's saying something! The real treat is what's going on beyond the dining room. Cooking classes and tasting dining. My friends have been taking the cooking classes. I am so thankful. Now our friends are bringing cooking techniques home with them and inviting us to dine at their homes & sharing! With the way it's benefited them, I can't wait to find some time to take a class!
