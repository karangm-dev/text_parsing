Went here as a last resort because a hose on my son's truck busted and we were stuck. They usually ask for a 24 hour turn-around, but because we had kids in the Nevada desert heat they made the hose with clamps, etc. in about 20 minutes. Great service and the part, which no auto parts store could replicate (strangely), was done perfectly.Super nice guys, not expensive at all, and they really saved the day. Thank you, guys, you're awesome!
