If you are looking for an excellent style at a low price, this is the place. The hairdressers here make sure that they know what kind of haircut you are looking for (even if you aren't sure about what kind of haircut you want walking into the salon), and always give their advice, take their time, and give their best effort.As someone who has been to other salons in Toronto, this is a quality place with a nice vibe at a low price. Even if they charged a higher rate, it would be worth it.
