There is a specific reason why I WALKED OUT of this reflexology studio before my hour was finished.  Please read on.  I live within a mile of this salon and decided to give it a try at 5:30pm on Tuesday, 8/18/2015.  The salon was empty, only one associate working -- "Amy."  She didn't hear the bell ring when I entered the front door, because she was in the back room talking on her cell phone.  After five minutes of me listening to her talking on speaker phone I walked back to let her know I was waiting.  Startled, she immediately discontinued her cell call and said to me: "Sorry."  We then promptly began the foot soak.  I closed my eyes.  20 minutes into the session, while she was rubbing on my feet I noticed that she stopped using two hands -- only using one hand.  I opened my eyes and saw that she was TEXTING on her cell phone.  She looked up at me, said "Sorry!" and put her phone away.  Two minutes later she did it a SECOND time, caught me looking at her, she again said "Sorry!!" and put her phone away.  Two minutes later she did it a THIRD time -- and again said, "Sorry!!!"  Finally, two minutes later I caught her texting a FOURTH time.  That did it for me.  I reached for a towel, dried my feet, and said, "Amy, we are FINISHED."  She said, "Sorry, Sorry, Sorry."  Normally, a one hour session was supposed to have been $35 for Deep Tissue (six dollars more than the usual $29).  We ended at the half-hour mark.  I asked how much I should pay her for a partial hour.  She said twenty dollars.  I paid her.  As I put my shoes on she asked, "Will you come back?" ----- I didn't know whether to be angry or laugh.  I just looked at her curiously for a second and then walked out the door.  Gold Spa Foot Reflexology, SORRY.
