I'm advocate seafood eater!! I came across this place by accident. I like the ambience, the staff is welcoming in a down to earth home sort of a way yet sophisticated. I've had the seafood platter, gumbo, garlic bread and cucumber Martini so far. Not disappointed at all. I definitely recommend if you are visiting or a new local and want something more like home this is a good place to visit.
