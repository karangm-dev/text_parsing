I used one star because thats the lowest I could pick. This place is an absolute hell hole. Every time I have gone in the store I become more and more amazed what a mess the place is. Walmart could improve their corporate image immensely if they just tore the place down and started over again. If you look up the word disaster in the dictionary, I swear they should have a picture of this store next to the meaning.The merchandise on the shelves is frequently not priced. Don't expect to get help from an employee because I don't think there are any and at the very least, you'll probably stand a better chance getting run over by a heard of buffalo while in the store. Very often, when the merchandise is placed on the shelves there is absolutely no method as to how it's arranged. Things are mixed up beyond belief. For a current example, I recently I went there to buy an oil filter. I should have known better but I was in a hurry. When I got to the isle with the filters I found them all completely mixed up. They were placed on the shelves in no particular order with all the different sizes, and there are literally scores of different sizes, totally un-arranged and mixed up. It looked like someone just literally dropped the filters out of an airplane and wherever they landed that's where the employees put them. There was no reference book to find the filter number I needed. They had an electronic engine filter finder but it didn't work. Needless to say, I gave up.Unfortunately it's not just the auto department either. Same thing in lawn and garden. Same thing in housewares. etc., etc.If you need to go to Walmert do yourself a favor and go to the one in Chardon. You'll be shocked by the difference.As I think about it, you probably should go in the store at least once. It's an experience you will never forget!
