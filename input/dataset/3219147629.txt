Used to be good 10 years ago until recently (2013-present) frequent visits all left us with the same souvenir, tummy-aches after we got home.Lots of Chinese celebrations here for mid-summer autumn and the new year. Is always booked for parties. Large selection of food and drinks. Decorated western-styled. Parking is a breeze.
