Unfortunately this location is not well managed. They refuse to stock all items on the menu (like sweet tea as an example) as they are unable to maintain normal levels of traffic at this location. Today I went back again and they were out of bread. Yes a Jimmy Johns out of bread. Most frustrating of all, the service is just not welcoming. Other locations nearby offer a full menu and more personable service (Euclid) so I avoid going to this location despite it being closer to my home. By the way, subway is right down the street. Don't like subway as much but head to head in this situation, subway is better.
