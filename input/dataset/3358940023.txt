Agh man this place is super! I've been here for my first time about a week ago and blown out of the water by there July's limited edition flavor. It's blue vanilla with 3 types of cookies in it if I remember correctly. Well I got the app and got $3 bucks off my order so that was sick! I returned the other day and was bummed they where out of it but only temporary she said. So she was nice enough to let me sample other flavors and I settled on the birthday cake mixed with pistachio and it was amazing but not as good as the other one. The staff here are great and service is fast and friendly overall I'll definitely be returning here!
