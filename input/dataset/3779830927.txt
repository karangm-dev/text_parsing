I purchased tile for my cottage from CIOT. Price was reasonable (although they quoted $1,600 to deliver! So I rented a van and took them there myself). I have 6 boxes unopened left over. It was 37 days since I bought them - past their 30 days refund by 7. I called the sales office to confirm I could return them - it's a trek from downtown to their Jane Street warehouse - should be no problem I was told. I waited 4 weeks for these tiles to come in so I thought this was not unreasonable. I got to the warehouse (finally) and after waiting 20 minutes for someone named Assad to show up to the desk after being paged multiple times (seriously, the entire staff were caught up in a "where's Assad" game - he never did show) someone named Annabelle looked at my receipt and said it was past 30 days and as per their policy they refused to take back the extra tile. Nice. CIOT sucks.
