Too much food and not good for diabetics the food is delicious.  Just had a spread of the waffle, protein omelette, veggie omelette, brioche french toast and chicken and waffles between 6 of us.  Oh left off apple pancakes.  All great and Tracee was the best waitress. She leads a great happy birthday too.
