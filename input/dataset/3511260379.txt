This is so much fun! We drove in the scooters to Red Rock. The view is so nice without windows. The passenger can take the photos (car fits two). For those who don't usually drive, the drive is on the road and on the highway alongside real cars, but luckily there aren't many cars, plus there is a guide in the front and in the back of the group to make sure it is a safe drive. Our guides were Donnie and Cody. We stopped at five locations in Red Rock to take pictures. Views were really nice. If not hiking, driving in the scooter cars is such a fun way to see Red Rock.
