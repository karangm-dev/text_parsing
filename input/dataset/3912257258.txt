We came for brunch. Service was soooooo slow. We both ordered the classic with bacon. Both our dishes came out with sausage and we told the waitress we ordered bacon she apologized and said she'd come right back with bacon. She never came back. The food was fine nothing to rave about. We wouldn't return.
