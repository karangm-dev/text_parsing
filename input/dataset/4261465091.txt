The worst dining experience I've had in a while.  Food came out prepared incorrectly and not even the thing I ordered.  Management had excuses, none of which was an apology.  Whatever. This dump can't and won't last much longer.  With such a revival in the downtown area underway, it's embarrassing that this restaurant thinks it belongs with the product they're putting out.
