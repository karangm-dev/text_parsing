This place is AWESOME!  I asked a restaurant where they got their bread because it was so good, "Great Buns"  I walked in and it smelled so good, fresh baked bread..awwww  The prices were just amazing.  I got 12 hamburger buns for $2.39!  GOOD buns not the crappy ones you get at the store....and 12 not 8!  So I picked up a cinnamon roll, almond filled croissant, a red velvet cup cake, 2 chocolate filled cup cakes, 2 doz hamburger buns, 1 doz hot buns, a round loaf of sour dough bread and a cranberry walnut loaf. I only spent $20!  I could have taken home the whole store.  My husband ate his chocolate cupcake, he is picky and said it was really gooood.  I had the cinnamon roll it was so yummy.  I am so going back.  Oh and they had cakes and cookies too....
