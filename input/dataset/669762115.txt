I went to El Chorro's around 6 pm with my wife and a friend from Chicago this past Saturday and will never go back there again. The host claimed that there were no tables available and that we would have to sit at the bar. We counted more than twenty open tables when we arrived and the same number when we left approximately 1.5 hours later. The food and drinks were ok and our waitperson was good, but overall, a very unpleasant experience.
