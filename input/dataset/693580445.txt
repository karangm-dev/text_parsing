Went here for brunch with my father for fathers day, he's totally a meat eater, but he's open minded sometimes. The food was delicious as always, I have the seitan and the girlfriend had the tofu salad sandwich. The brunch buffet has Peanut Noodles to die for! As well the spinach and strawberry salad was yummy! The environment makes this place even more awesome! We spent some time exploring the antique shop after we were done eating and it's reminds me of my great aunt Mary's bedroom, just filled with awesome trash.Overall please go to here for brunch on Sundays. You won't regret it, and even your non-vegetarian parents will fall in love.
