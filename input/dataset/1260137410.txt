Such a great place to stay. This place is so clean and smells good. The beds here are so comfy. No bed bugs at all!! They also have a great selection for continental breakfast. The pool is nice and beautiful. The staff is extremely nice and helpful. If you are bringing your dog, this place is great it's pet friendly and they don't charge to bring your dog. This place is also extremely quiet for being right next to an airport, it was also cool to see planes taking off and coming in right outside the window. So if you are looking for a nice quiet clean hotel in Las Vegas don't look any further this is the place.
