I went there for lunch.  The waitress obviously did not know the menu.  The dish she explained was not what I received.  A runner brought the food out and when the waitress came by soon after.  You could see the " I got that wrong" expression on her face.  She immediately started asking if she could get me something else.  The food was ok, the portion was tiny and it was way over priced.  Starting with better service, this could be a good place.
