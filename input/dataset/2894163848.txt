Horrible. The water we got was clearly unfiltered tap water. The gyro was cold, my daughter's fried fish was still frozen inside. We gave it back and they brought the same cut apart piece back after frying it again. Of course it was overcooked, dry and hard now. The chicken soup was sour from too much vinegar (who puts vinegar in chicken soup anyways?). Eventually they counted my son, who is less than a year old and only eats his baby food as the sixth guest and therefore added 18% gratuity to the check for this bad service.Never again.
