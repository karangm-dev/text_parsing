Oh I really wanted to love this place. I LOVE southern food. I am the girl who will eat her weight in BBQ, fried chicken, grits, greens and still have room for buttermilk or chess pie. I say, "take sushi and shove it," so you can imagine how hard it is for me to find favorite restaurants in what seems like an interminable land of sushi joints. All that to say I was completely onboard with Yardbird's concept going in to the visit.My friends and I tried brunch here. They were out of champagne... On a Friday... Of a holiday weekend. How does that work?! Fine. I'll have coffee instead. It was very good coffee, worth both stars I've given the place. The bacon maple donuts were good too. The cornbread was ok. Eggs Benedict was ok. The sweet tea tasted like something you'd by in a can from 7/11. The server was nice. Overall, I wouldn't recommend Yardbird. I think they may be trying to make southern food "hip" for the masses who have sushi and "trend" addictions (i.e. Most Californians) who don't understand how amazing good old southern cooking is if it's left unfussy. Luckily for me, my work allows me to travel to the real South where I can eat my fill of the real deal.
