Great variety in the menu! Use lindt chocolate and/or nutella to make their sweet dishes.  There are some savory options too (but who goes here for that???) and of course the gorgeous chocolate dome that the waitress was so kind about waiting for me to get my phone out to take a video. It's very small but I hear they're expanding. Some alcoholic drinks are offered too, including dessert kinds. Wifi was password protected and we never found out what that password was
