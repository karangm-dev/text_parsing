Tony has amazing specialty items! I shop vintage & antique in many cities & there are many keeper finds in this store. The prices are set to move which is a bonus indeed. I love vintage leather bags & he has MANY from mid century up through the 70's to semi current. I'd say his strong  point is 60's & 70's leather bags from all over the world. I found a bag from Africa & a briefcase from the Minister of Health in Montreal. Lots of his items have great stories! I'm on business in Montreal & have too much gear with me already- how am I going to get this great suitcase home??
