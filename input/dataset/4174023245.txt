Our daughter's car broke down en route to Vegas to attend EDC.  AAA took her to Tony and thank goodness. He figured out the problem right away and worked hard to get her car ready a.s.a.p for a reasonable price.  Only she didn't bother to pick it up when she said she would... leaving him struggling to find a safe place for it over the weekend. Was he mad?  No, but he should have been!  Instead, he was concerned about her and made sure her car would be safe. This is a family run business where they truly care.
