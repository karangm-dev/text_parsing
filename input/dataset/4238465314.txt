I've purchased from three different Benz dealerships and had service at five dealerships over the years.  This one is the best - Schumacher knows how to treat their customers, they understand our expectations and exceed them.  The service advisors are honest when it comes to repairs and it's always buzzing with tons of very friendly and courteous staff.  Cute fleet of C class loaners too.We take our cars here for detailing every few months and they do a spectacular job. Take note: if you have all season floor covers you might want to tell them to use minimal product on them - I lose my footing when getting in the cars because they're so slick.It's a busy place so don't be surprised to pull up for service and have to wait a few minutes.  Prices are on par with other Benz dealerships.
