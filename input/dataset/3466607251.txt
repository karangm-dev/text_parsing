Next time you're getting ice for your next party or BBQ, don't get it at a convenience store or gas station it's a total rip off especially when you are paying for just frozen water when you think about it.I have been going to The Ice Man which is convenient for me since it is in my neighbourhood and open 7 days a week. Their prices are much cheaper than other stores and they also deliver.They serve both walk-in customers to restaurants and they carry anything from a 5 pound bag of ice cubes, to dry ice, to large slabs of ice for ice carving, to rental refrigeration equipment.They have excellent customer service and always eager to help. They were also nice enough to carry your purchases to your car if needed.
