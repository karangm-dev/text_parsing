I was quite worried that I would have a difficult time getting to Madison from Milwaukee. However my host who I decided to stay with to fulfill a promise I made to him if I ever made it out to Wisconsin suggested I try Badger Bus to get to Madison (he could have told me about Badger Bus while I was still in DC, but I digress...) Anyhow, I ordered the tickets online ($40 round trip), went to Milwaukee Intermodal Station, gave the driver my name, and got on the comfortable bus! If I was going to rate, I was going to rate 4 for lack of outlets for charging. However, the very friendly bus driver announced that the outlets were on the floor near my ankles...sure enough the were. I am from "back east" where they are usually under the windows, but I was happy they had them so 5 stars! There is free WiFi as well but I have unlimited data, so I am good. I would definitely use this again and highly recommend if you a traveling to and from Milwaukee/Madison.
