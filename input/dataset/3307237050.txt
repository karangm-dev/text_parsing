Okay I get it. Trader Joe's has some prepackaged stuff that seems like the gods sent it. But really. This IS the place to get food for your cocktail party.This ISN'T the place to buy all your groceries.If you shop here (and other places) long enough, you'll notice that some of the stuff is VERY inexpensive and reasonably priced while other stuff is enourmously out-of-control pricey. And then you'll know your way around.Cheap:cheesebeervodka/liquorolive oilpeanut buttercooler/lunchbagExpensive:pastapre-made foodsmoothiesproduce (prewrapped/cut)??? Also: they don't know what beets are. If that bothers you, then don't come here.
