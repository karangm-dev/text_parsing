Every time I come to Vegas, I immediately book with JoJo to get my lashes done! I came back again this time and like always, she does the best job!!! Everyone at Kyou beauty salon is accommodating and sooooooo nice! Their prices are definitely fair for what the results you get. I would highly recommend booking in advance because Jojo can get pretty booked up. She's THAT good! Can't wait to visit again! Third photo is from this time around!
