I'm sad to give Le Gourmand a bad review as they have the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever had. However, when a colleague and I stopped by for lunch today I couldn't believe the service we received. I decided to get a peanut butter cookie and she ordered lunch. The board clearly said that the Barbecue Chicken came with roasted red potatoes and coleslaw. An employee set my colleague's plate on the ledge saying it was ready. They had put mashed potatoes on the plate instead of red potatoes. My colleague kindly mentioned this and asked for red potatoes instead.The employee at Le Gourmand angrily started mouthing off, grabbed the plate, tossed the chicken and potatoes back in the hot table and then threw the plate hard into the dish pit. She then huffed and puffed while she made my colleague a new plate. She slammed it back down on the counter and didn't even acknowledge my colleague let alone apologize to her. Absolutely baffled by this service. Do not treat your customers with such disrespect when they have done nothing wrong but order from the menu and expect to get what they ordered.
