We've purchased a lot of furniture and home decor from RC Willey. But my last sofa I bought was delivered without one of the pillows. Went to the store after calling, and was told it's been sent to thier warehouse. I asked them to send it to the Henderson Store off Stephanie. In May it'll be a year! After several attempts at emails, and calls, we're still waiting for our matching pillow! No response from them at all! Was going to buy  beautiful office furniture and more decor to match, but not until they take of my lost pillow for my queen-size sleeper sofa!
