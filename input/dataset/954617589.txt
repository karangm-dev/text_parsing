Always a winner! We hopped in for a quick bite at 4:10 yesterday. By 4:25 the place was packed with a line out the door. You can not have a bad experience at Barrio. Drinks are delicious, food is beyond delicious, service is consistently good. I was glad our dinner reservation was late so we could hop in to Barrio at 4:00 and enjoy a little something. I wish we had one close to home - I'd be there multiple times a week!
