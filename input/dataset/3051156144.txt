Never eat here if you like your moneys worth.  The single worst place I have ever eat period and dollar for dollar.  The grape leaf appetizers we actually disgusting and I eat some crazy shit.  The two dishes me and my gf had were so bland.  Dessert was the worst, we only got it too hopefully redeem some part of meal.  $8 crunchy tiramsu is what we got, frozen and bland also.  If a chesse dessert is frozen that means the cheap bastard use a watered down version of actual cream.  Literally a dining joke.  I hope this place goes out of business as it is a crime that people have to pay for this.
