At 8:42 this morning 5/7/16,  I started to go online to see if there were any I-10 closures. Then the traffic girl from 3 TV came on to report the traffic and assured everyone the I-10 closures that we're currently going on was Eastbound at Avondale and Westbound at Dysart. Never did she mention eastbound between I-17 and 51 was completely shut down!  Should have known better than to count on her for an accurate traffic report on my way to work Saturday morning. Thank you for almost making me late. Next time I will be sure to tune in to a traffic reporter who is up-to-date on the latest freeway closures.
