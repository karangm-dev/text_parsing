A little different take and flare than your typical Greek restaurant.  Very unique modeled in Peloponese style both in flavors and ambiance.  Outdoor patio will offer a more authentic experience and service here is exceptional. The lobster was perfect and the lemon oil garnish is to die for.  The general manager Jackie was very knowledgeable of the Chef's background as well as friendly and welcoming.  Milos special is also a must with a side of skordalia.  If you are looking for traditional Greek food this is probably not for you but if you are a Greek looking for an innovative approach to your authentic old country favorite, this place will exceed your expectations.
