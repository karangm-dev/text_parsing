I had my wedding event at The Venue last month and couldn't ask for a more perfect place or staff!  It was truly a pleasure to work with everyone there!  Through the whole process they were pleasant, professional and quick to respond in all e-mail/phone communications and meetings.  They can help you with almost every aspect of your wedding or event, from catering to coordinating, marketing, and even sound and lighting.  The Venue itself has so much charm and beauty on its own that I didn't need to bring in a lot of extra decor to dress it up.  Plus, when they opened the retractable roof, it gave the  feeling of being outdoors and provided awesome natural lighting for my photos and videos.  The location is great too! Plenty of parking nearby and it is within walking distance of many fabulous boutiques and restaurants in Old Town.  There is even an array of accommodations for your guests nearby and some within walking distance.
