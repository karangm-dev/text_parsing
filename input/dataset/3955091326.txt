I'm a Vegas local and recently visited the LVH for a wine tasting and went to dinner at Tatuado after the wine tasting.  Long story short...the street tacos served at the wine tasting were 100x better than the food served at Tatuado.The chips tasted like they were straight from the bag.  The salsa tasted like it was straight from the bottle.  The potato salad they served tasted exactly like the Reser's kind you get at the deli (in other words, gross).  When I asked for chips with my sandwich, they brought out Sun Chips.  Really?  Everything I ate here I could've bought on my own at my local grocery store.My friends didn't like their food at all (cheese enchilada and chicken sandwich).  My club sandwich was good.  The biggest positive was the strawberry margarita.  It was delicious.  Overall, this place was very mediocre.  I wouldn't return.  There are SO many better options in Vegas.
