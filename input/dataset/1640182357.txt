The Songbird Coffee & Tea House (SCTH) sits directly on Roosevelt Street sharing such distinction with two other coffee shops namely, Tammie Coe Cakes and Lola's Coffee (just off, Red Hut Coffee, JoBot Coffee, and Fair Trade Cafe). SCTH shares a space with with an art gallery and leather works manufacturing space. SCTH has a large window front facing the road (like Lola's) where you can perch and ponder passing traffic and gaze at the Phx downtown skyline, to include the Valley Ho. (Matt's Big Breakfast's FORMER location had a similar such lovely view...no longer.) SCTH carries baked goods from a favorite local bakery and each time I visit, other patrons make a point of extolling the degree to which they enjoy their own purchase.Today I had a Cortado. My first Cortado ever was at the (former) Mud Dauber, now known as Demi. I enjoyed my sup. The servers here are matter of fact and prompt. The dairy is not readily available and must be requested.
