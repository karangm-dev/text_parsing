My siblings and I looked this place up on Yelp before coming in and with 4 1/2 stars we were excited to come in and order . When we got there were very surprised at the lack of professionalism and order in the establishment . First, The area where you order was crammed and it was hard to maneuver to order and the worker even took our order from our side of the counter . We placed our order and as we Waited VERY patiently (you have to have patience here) it took AT LEAST 30 minutes just to get our tacos and all of our food came separately within a 30-45 min time span . As we began to eat we noticed the meat was SEVERELY under seasoned , we had to add salt to everything and the salsa had no kick at all or flavor . The idea of the salsa was so much better than the taste . And to wash it down we had a soda from the soda machine that was nearly out of syrup and it was obvious . Our view was a dirty kitchen and the two workers speaking very loudly  about how long everyone's order was going to take IN FRONT of the customers . There was so much wrong with this place I think 4 1/2 stars was VERY excessive but , different strokes for different folks .... You've been warned
