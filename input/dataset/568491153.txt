Okay, I was extremely nervous when I talked to Josh for the first time.  My request was to custom paint a pair of audiophile speakers that cost more than most of the cars he typically would paint and repair.  I met him at his shop and showed him the speakers.  He had never had a request like this but was up for the challenge.  I wasn't so sure he could pull it off and was in panic mode.  When they were done he met me halfway to deliver the speakers, which in itself is going one more step than he had to.  They were perfect.  I could not be more happier.  Trust Josh.  He will do a great job!
