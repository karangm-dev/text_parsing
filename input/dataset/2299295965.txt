It's pretty rare for me to write fast food reviews. But considering I have always have superb experiences, it's only fair to give them the credit they deserve. As far as I know, until now, Vegas only had one Freddy's location. I was stoked to find out the new one was opening near me. For me, fast food consists of maybe 5 places- and this is one of them. They serve steak-burgers, so it may cost more than average, but not by much. You can get 2 different styles of burgers: A Freddy's burger that comes with pickle, mustard, and onion. (my preference) Or a California burger. Same meat, but this one comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, and a "Freddy's sauce" which is your typical thousand island, fry sauce, spread, etc. They also offer Chicago style hot dogs, grilled chicken sandwiches, and desserts. The service is always, without a doubt, amazing. They train the employees well and it shows. Good quality, good prices, and good people. Do yourself a favor and skip Wendy's, McDonald's, and for sure pass by the Taco Bell next to this place, you won't regret it.
