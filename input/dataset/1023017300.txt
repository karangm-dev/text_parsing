Went later tonight to come with my boyfriend to get his haircut by Sonia. We told her what we wanted and she did it better than we expected! For first time goers to Evolve, we'll be definitely coming back! Complementary drinks, hot towel and wash after hair cuts and the cozy atmosphere make this place for what it is. Prices are reasonable for the area too.
