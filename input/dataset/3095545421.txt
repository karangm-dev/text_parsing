First time posting a review and first time visiting Ace of Fades.First impression: this place lives up to the reviews/hype.  We happened to be in the area.  (Walk-in) We were welcomed, the place was busy, but my son was in the chair in less than 20 min.  The cut was the best he's had in a very long time.  EXTREMELY happy.  So happy, I will probably continue to bring him here and make the 20-25 minute drive.  Well worth it!
