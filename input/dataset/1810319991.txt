We waited 45 minutes for our food. I asked how much longer it would take and was told up to 10 more minutes. I asked if the management would give us a discount for the wait. I saw our very friendly waitress approach her manager who was clearly annoyed by the question  (we made eye contact more than once). The waitress came back and said she was really sorry but they can't do anything about the wait because everyone else is waiting too. So we canceled our order, and they made us pay for the tea we drank!Now I know it wasn't much but when I've had a problem like this at other restaurants, the manager always comes over to the table and hears the grievance personally. The wait staff was great but the management was sloppy and hands off.So we drove all the way to Siam Thai (which was pretty busy) and had an excellent meal which was served promptly.
