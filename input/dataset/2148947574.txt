So based on food alone they would have 3 stars but thats just not the case..arrived just after 5pm..they had a private party going on but they looked to be well taken care of and winding down...after placing our order we got our drinks and found a table...went back to wait for our food and was told they will bring it out to us...after 15 minutes and watching someone who ordered after us receive their food i went back up to the desk. ..and watched as our food sat on the counter and for another 5 minutes before they finally brought it out...and they didn't have our full order..it took the food runner 3 separate trips..heres a run down of our orderPulled chicken..not actually pulled but diced and dryTurkey..very good moist and tender Pulled pork..very good..lot of flavorMac and cheese..not the best but not the worstGreenbeens..good..the only hot side we gotBanana bread pudding..full of butter but not horribleOverall food was 3 stars service was 1
