I would probably give this place no stars if I could... My sales experience with JD Byrider so far has been mediocre. My car sales lady Kat told me that my payments on my car would be reported twice as much bc I make two payments in one month. THAT WAS A LIE! Not to mention I referred one of my co-workers to this place and her car sales person forgot to send in the referral paperwork so I could get my check. I had a bunch of people constantly tell me they would call me back and they never did. So I speak to BOB the sales manager and he tells me that he's going to find out and call me back..   an hour later JUST GUESS ... No call back so I call again and he is the first person to answer the phone call, then he has the nerve to say he's on a phone conference call and that he will call me back. I don't understand if you're on a phone conference call that's so important why are you answering the main phone? That just doesn't make any sense. I could be wrong. I will say this place is a great place to go if you have bad credit and no car! That's about it.
