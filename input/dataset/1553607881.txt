Being a client of Active Renter Property Management, I can honestly say that the employees and the company as a whole go above and beyond on a regular basis. They don't treat their clients like 'a number.' It is nice to hear that a company cares more about people rather than numbers and income. I recently had an appliance issue that Active Renter was ready and energetic to help and make sure everything was up and running right away. I will recommend them to any and all of my friends in need of an apartment or house.
