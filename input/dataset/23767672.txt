Incredibly upset customer. We have spent lots of money with this company. We bought a bed, two night stands, and a dresser and a mirror for it. Everything went well until right now. They give you 25$ to spend on next purchase when you buy something from them, which is great. Went to the store to find a TV stand and they didn't have what we wanted, so we ended up ordering it online and had to wait 4 days, which sucks because they didn't have what we needed and we already found it online before hand and we come to the store and they don't have it! It gets worse we wait for 4 days and go pick it up at the store we bring it in our car and unpack it at home and this TV stand has a huge crack, which is a structural damage. On top of that the corner of the stand is scratched and you can tel that the workers put paint or gloss on it to cover it up. They saw it was damaged and they still delivered it to us?? Excuse me?? Now we call and have them exchange it and pick it up from our house and they said they will, but when we ask for compliment delivery they deny it and say no. After all this hassle they can't help a paying customer that has spent thousand at their store? That is poor customer service. That 25$ they offered us they took that from us and put that towards the delivery, which is about $90, or something like that, so really it doesn't benefit us at all! All this time spent waiting for our TV stand they try to cover up scratches, they can't help us out with delivery which is no big deal for them. I'm done giving my money to this business, no more. Very nice workers, but the policy is horrible. We could have spent lots more because we need more furniture, but we're done with living spaces. They're not very considerate when it comes to situations like this.
