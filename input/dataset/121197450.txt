I have to echo Daren's words in regards to the pork. Good lord, that was tender and delicious! I'm normally not even a big fan of pork products, but this place may change me.Also, the two owners are from Hawaii and give their dishes a very home-cooked feel, as if I was dining in their own home. Definitely recommend going out of your way to eat here; and if you're close by, there's no reason you shouldn't stop in for lunch!
