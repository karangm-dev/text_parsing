As a first time waxer, I was extremely nervous going into my appointment with Shaina. However, she made me feel so comfortable and she is so skilled in her trade. I was extremely pleased with the results. Shaina truly is a Master Aesthetician. I highly recommend Shaina and her staff at Pink Cherry to anybody looking to get waxed.
