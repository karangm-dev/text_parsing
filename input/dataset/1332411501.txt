This place is going to be my new favorite ramen place in Vegas. Wife and I both ordered the Shio ramen, and I got some extra chasu. Broth was simple yet very flavorful. I really liked the thick cut chasu with a bit char flavor to it. As for noodle, I personally like thick noodle more, but their noodle was perfect with the soup, so I'm fine with that.Other than the food itself, I like how you sit by the bar and the chef serve the ramen right to you. The store also provide hair ties which my wife felt was very thoughtful.Overall, wife and I both enjoyed our ramen, friendly service, definitely will be back
