Excellent resort, we had a great view on the 22nd floor of the strip. Everybody who works there is super polite. And of course can't complain about the variety of restaurants, food and shops in the Venetian / Palazzo. Matter of fact they have a whole floor dedicated to shopping with a HUGE HUGE variety of food, cafes, stores from super ultra high end to fairly affordable clothing to skin care shops to bag shops. It has everything in terms of shopping.It also has many pools, fitness centre and all your typical resort stuff. Super nice rooms with elegant decor. Even though it is located slightly north of all the other casinos, it's still in walkable distance to every other casino.Even the main lobby and the decor on the first floor is really exquisite. Everybody is super nice and I see why it has achieved it's 5 star status as a hotel. If I'm ever back in town, I'd consider staying at the Venetian again!
