OMG this place is soooo amazing!  I never thought a Chinese-Mexican fusion place would be so good.  I came here while out in Phoenix for Spring Training.  It was suggested by some friends that had come earlier in the month.  I love trying new places but was scared because I had my entire family with me.  Every single person just loved their food.  I had a combo plate with Jerk chicken, Jade chicken and Jerk fried rice.  It came with choice of beans and I suggest you get the black beans!  Delicious!!!  And a added bonus a yummy cookie.  How much better can this meal get?Just a little warning, if you don't like spicy food pass on the jerk style.  This was our cheapest and best meal of the entire trip!  If we would have come here first we may have eaten here everyday!!!!
