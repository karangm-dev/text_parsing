This may be the best the best restaurant in Northeast Ohio, including all of Cleveland.  Have been a dozen times and am never disappointed.  Every time I give a new restaurant a shot, I question why I just didn't head back to Russo's.  Cajun cuisine is straight out of the NOLA play book and every bit as good - the gumbo and étouffée rock and they know how to prepare soft shell crab. Specials are always on point, often seasonal, and desserts never disappoint.  Bacchus Lounge is also a great counter balance to the white tablecloths.
