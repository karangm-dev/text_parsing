When in the mood for great dessert, this is the place. The great part is a majority of their desserts are Gluten free. If undecided on what to get, you cannot go wrong with any of the macaroons, they are the best in town!!!!! Also the cakes that they are designing are out of this world. And don't be scared of the vegan chocolate chip cookie it is amazing. Everything is fresh and no preservatives, so don't be mad if they sell out of something and don't have back ups. Also they carry a large selection of wines. High quality, great taste, can't go wrong.
