I like neon. Theres just something about it that says taboo allure to indulge in all sort of human vices. Moths to the Noble Gas flame, people seem to slither their way to these oasis's of the night, incubating amongst each other in a haze of sensory saturation. Kelly's beckons to the person who wants to sit and have a beer, the person who may want to catch someone's eye without filtering through waves of affliction shirts over the rancor of the latest Young ___zy song, perhaps someone who wants to wear argyle and sport a mustache and still think its not ironic that he(she?) is trying to be ironic, the person who simply wants to enjoy a solid bev for a price point for "chincy" Pittsburghers. Me? well, I like a stiff drink and 70's decor. Somewhere in a previous life I wore nothing but polyester. More like Miami Vice, or maybe Boogie Nights. Either way, environment is always friendly, or intimate, depending on what you wish. You cant go wrong with a French 57, the mac and cheese is all sorts of nom nom, and the tab for a night at Kellys is something you can feel comfortable taking home, even if you aren't taking anything else.
