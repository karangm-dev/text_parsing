I had some terrible bonding work on my front teeth done by another cosmetic dentist and didn't feel comfortable going back to that doctor to fix it. I found Dr. Nielson online with examples of his bonding work. I met with 5 doctors. A few recommended 4 veneers, another said my problem could not be fixed. I decided to put my faith in Dr. Nielson and ended up with a result that makes me want to smile again (and feel like 'me' again!) The office is nice, the staff is super helpful.  I can't say enough good things about Dr. Nielson. I would recommend and return. Thank you so much for giving me my smile back!
