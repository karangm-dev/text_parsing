Decent environment and tolerable food but poor poor service and a problems with the taps? It took forever to get a beer and it appeared as if it was because the staff was having trouble with pouring them. When I got it finally it tastes flat. I would have sent it back but I didn't feel like waiting another 10 minutes. Could be a decent place if they cleaned up their act a little but there are better options for now.
