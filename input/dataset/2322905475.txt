This location's night crew is amazing, as a vegan it is always nerve racking when you get off of work late and the only places open are fast food joints who dont exactly specialize in plant based cuisine.  I have actually not been to a Taco Bell since I made this dramatic lifestyle change for two reasons, out of fear that the staff would not be knowledgeable about my dietary restrictions or that i would be a massive inconvenience.Now, I have been to this location twice and drove thru, the staff was knowledgeable about what ingredients I can not eat and found creative ways to add value to my meal since i wasn't getting cheese, meat or sour cream.Take care of these employees they are the reason I will be coming back!
