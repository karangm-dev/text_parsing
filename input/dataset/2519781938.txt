My husband and I recently remodeled a home we bought about three years ago.   Our contractor suggested checking out Diamond Kitchen and Bath.   Marty Moorehead took care of us and did a great job.   He was very thorough and came out and measured everything.  We bought cabinets for the kitchen and two bathrooms. The cabinets look amazing.   There was a door that was warped and a pantry drawer took some damage in shipping.   Diamond immediately got replacements ordered.   We couldn't be happier.   (We love the soft glide drawers). I highly recommend Diamond Kitchen and Bath and Marty Moorehead.  (And English Building Company)
