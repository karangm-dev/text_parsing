I opened up a business and needed photos taken for my website. I told her my vision, gave her a couple sample images of what "look" we were going for, and I just sat back and watched her as she just took off with our concept and did something incredible with it. Michelle is an incredibly talented person. She picked the best locations and went above and beyond to ensure that our photos and website turned out great! I would recommend her in a heartbeat and she is who I will continue to go to for all our business' photography needs. Thanks Michelle!
