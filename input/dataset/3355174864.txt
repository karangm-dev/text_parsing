Like to say Robert and his staff is the most unprofessional and rude staff I've met. We order the italian combo on doordash and since we didnt specify that we wanted veggies on it (which there wasnt an option too) they gave us a sandwhich with bread and meat. 5 years we have been going here not once have we been asked for veggies on it. The italian combo came one way and thats it and that's with meat veggies etc.. All they could say is that its doordashes fault, not there. He laughed and said there nothing he can do for us. After a 70 dollar order, all he could do is laugh and tell us to contact doordash. Well you lost a customer tonight for your little laugh. Thanks Robert
