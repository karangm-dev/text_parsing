I finally had the opportunity to visit the famous Peppermill restaurant and I was not disappointed. My first night in Vegas I was hungry after attending a concert so we decided  to ear  breakfast here. We were seated on  the diner side, the decor is retro and I loved it. I also returned to the Peppermill my second night because I wanted to visit their fireside lounge for cocktails. I know sometimes restaurants don't live up to the hype, this is one lives up to the hype.
