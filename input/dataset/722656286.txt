Visited x 2 - During my recent stay to Vegas - I'll be back again. I really enjoyed the Scalp Shampoo; was really nice. - Yes! - Believe the reviews - This place is very safe and well run. Staff are very nice, polite and helpful. Prices are good. Pretty easy to travel to from wherever you are. Staff will help you get on your way when you are finished. Located - "Upstairs" - They do have an elevator. Again - I highly recommend. The Review on Yelp are accurate.
