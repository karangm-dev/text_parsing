We ventured out to this great place and we weren't disappointed. The Backyard burger will become a tradition for my Vegas visits. The Biloxi chicken sandwich and steak salad are also very very good.   Service was polite and professional and though we had a trainee for our meal, everything went well. I'd recommend this place to anyone for a reasonably priced well prepared meal.
