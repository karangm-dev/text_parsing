Not good. I relocated from San Diego last year, where service was always efficient and top-notch, and the energy within the store was always high. The Scottsdale store is... lifeless. You walk in, and there's almost never someone in the front to greet you. Employees here seem disengaged and apathetic. Unless you're buying shoes, you'll have tremendous difficulty finding someone to provide assistance--even though the ratio of employees to customers is usually 2:1. Checkout usually requires 10-15 minutes of tapping your credit card on countertop at the register before someone walks over to address you. After my last experience, where I waited over 15 minutes, made eye contact with three employees, and still no help, I walked out without my purchases. I'll have to give my business to Sole Sports, instead.
