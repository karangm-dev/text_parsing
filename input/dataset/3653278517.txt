Just mediocre.  I don't know why anyone would eat here.  Chicken is cooked ok - but it really doesn't have much flavor and the skin is just kind of rubbery and gross.  Garlic ranch sauce they have at the salsa bar is disgusting.  Their pico de gallo is bland - they make it with cucumbers which adds nothing but lack of flavor.I bought 2 groupons here and used one today.  I won't even bother using the other one.
