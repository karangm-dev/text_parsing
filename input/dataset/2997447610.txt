Ok.... So the only reason I even went to this place was because I didn't want to re-park my car after I found out "Cartel" was a breakfast joint.... In hindsight, I should have re parked my car. This place is so very amazingly and exceptionally average. As in like, my stomach was full but not because the food was so good I couldn't help but to eat every last bite, as much it was because I only had an hour forlunch. Wife ordered a "tortilla soup" and some type of healthy rice and grilled veggie meal. The soup was barely edible (salty, over spiced and FULL of corn) and the rice was reheated from cold storage and the grilled veggies were soggy. My Reuben was edible. That's about where that stops but for full disclosure purposes, I'm a bit of a Reuben snob. (See former reviews of the Reuben at Windsor) My daughters burger was meh. Fries and tater toys were deep fried in the same grease that was not only old and badly needed to be changed but also used to fry the fish they were serving for the fish and chips. Gross!! Fishy tasting fries!  Service was below average. Waitress not only had a huge case of the "idontgivadamns" but wasn't anywhere to be found except to drop off food and take Initial order.  Decor was dated. I could go on and on. I won't return and I highly recommend going anywhere else downtown besides this place. Hell, the hot dog guy on the corner of Jefferson and central is a 100% improvement from this joint.
