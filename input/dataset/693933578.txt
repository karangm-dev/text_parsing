Before getting into the negative portion of my review, it is important to note, that Moses, Damon, and Demetrius were all great - worked hard, friendly, respectful, and really helped my husband and I out with our move this past weekend. As with any move, there were several items that were just slightly nicked and damaged (a curtain rod, the bed nightstand, a lamp shade, and some wall art). We appreciated that the team was clear and upfront about the damage that those items incurred. However, after the team left, we found that our flat screen tv was heavily damaged. Careful handling unfortunately was not the case for this item. It was packed and taped by the team, loaded and then unloaded, and then left in a room with the damage facing the wall and tucked behind some other items. This is not a case of the screen being scratched or the case being chipped, this is obvious damage that should have easily been noticed during unpacking. My husband and I found it odd that the team was very upfront about other damage, but the most damaged and most expensive item appeared to be placed away from immediate view without any notice.  We reached out to Skinny Wimp to see what sort of coverage they offered for damaged items and unfortunately the basic insurance package that we were automatically enrolled in only covered $0.60/lb. No one ever intends to damage an expensive item, but I wish they would've told us that there were other coverage options -moving in and of itself is expensive, let alone having the unanticipated cost of having to purchase a brand new TV due to a bit of the movers' carelessness.
