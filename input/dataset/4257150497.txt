I have been wanting to check out Lumberjaxe for a while now. So, for a surprise date with my husband, I booked us a time slot out here. The time slots are for an hour and it is $20 per person. Make a reservation.....especially if you are wanting to go on a weekend or night.We arrived, signed in, and grabbed a beer (yes, they sell beer.....at first it sounded odd but later into the hour, it seemed to fit well). They had a lot of beverage options including a good many local drafts. My husband and I both settled on a Juicy Jay IPA.Next we met our instructor, Tim. Each lane of two is assigned an instructor. I didn't know we would have a dedicated person and it made all the different. Tim was absolutely fantastic (on a side note: Tip your instructor please!)!! We started off with the basic 3 throws. I settled on the two arm overhand and my hubby liked the one handed overhand. We through a ton of axes for a while just to get the hang of it and Tim would give us feedback on where to better stand or throw to make it stick. After about 25 minutes of throwing axes, we seemed to get the hang of it and most of our axes were sticking. We ended up playing 3 games (each game is 3 rounds of 5 throws per person) against each other. Overall, this was so so so much fun. We cannot wait to return and bring friends!Remember closed toed shoes.
