The idea of Mooyah is not much different from a Five Guys or a Smashburger, though the execution is way off base, as evidenced by a nearly empty dining room despite being there during lunch hours (late lunch, but still lunch - other nearby eatieries were packed).Approaching the register, you order your protein: Mooyah burger, which can be doubled, turkey (which is ground, but not everyone seems to know if it's ground, cutlet or fried) or black bean. Go with the black bean - the others aren't worth it, especially the namesake Mooyah.After that, you choose your cheese, if you want it, for an extra charge. If you want avocado or bacon, you add that, for an extra charge. Then you add any of a bunch of extra toppings, for no extra charge. This is nice, but it gets into that realm where you can really screw up the taste if you aren't careful - having some pre-made choices would be a good idea (think of the Smashburger menu for some examples).The good news is that you aren't likely to mess up that bad, because nothing really has much flavor, including the Mooyah burger. Maybe this is the way they make it, but it's not good. Adding a condiment like Cholula (nice to see, but not nice to need it) can help.Even toppings, such as lettuce, tomato and onion strings don't have a lot of flavor. Don't like bleu cheese? Don't worry, because it's bland. About the only thing that did have a taste were the black bean burger and the nicely crisped bacon, so those might be good choices if you're after something with taste. The fries, supposedly that take "24 hours to make in a six-step process"? Also not worth it, so skip 'em.
