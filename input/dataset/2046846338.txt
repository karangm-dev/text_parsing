To add to what others have said:it is *such* a comfortable environment. So cozy, homely - even with (or because of) the strange, eclectic art and furniture. The many friendly regulars that are always here contribute to the comfort.Also, the BEST smoothie I've ever had. This is because they make it with rose water (often used in Indian deserts). And it's different every time, depending on who's making it, what's available.I've been there for breakfast once, which the owner - Amin (?can't remember) - prepares for you. I ordered a plate of seasoned tomatoes, feta, olive oil, and basil, with pita..... more delicious than you can imagine They also have the usual eggs-and-toast. And you can enjoy your breakfast at the counter, chatting with the chef/owner. (Breakfast only on Saturdays and Sundays though)
