Amazing, amazing, amazing! My husband and I have been here twice and have loved it! Everything we've ever ordered was perfect from chicken to fish to steak to sushi! All of the above including our cocktails and service. You must have the raspberry lemon drops if you are a cocktail drinker!!! DO IT!!!
