I went to This Magic Moment last weekend with my stepmom and friends to look for wedding gowns, and I was so happy I found it.  They have a great selection of beautiful gowns, which Mashel and her business partner personally shop for and stock the store with.They were very accommodating for our group, and it's very personal with only one appointment in the shop at a time, so there is no pressure.  When we arrived, I noticed they had even set out a little sign welcoming me to the store.  The dresses are samples, so you try on and buy what they have.  So it's really a matter of chance whether they have a gown that fits you and is what you're looking for when you're there.  However, I have to say I was VERY impressed by the variety and quality of everything they had in stock.  Nothing I tried on was very worn, and everything was in great shape.I didn't end up buying a dress here, but would certainly recommend This Magic Moment to anyone willing to shop for sample gowns!
