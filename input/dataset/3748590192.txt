I can't tell you how many times I've donated unintentionally to this place from them over charging me on the side of potatoes, by charging me an extra $1 for fiesta potatoes. A side of potatoes is 50 cents, and fiesta potatoes with sour cream and cheese is $1.49. These people continue to over charge by registering it as fiesta potatoes and then removing the sour cream and cheese, but I am still getting charged $1.49 instead of 50 cents. My husband likes their potatoes so I end up donating them a dollar from their stupidity about 10 times a month! I'm not even exaggerating either, we frequent this location quite often. Today took the cake when it comes to common sense. They charged me once again for fiesta potatoes without removing sour cream and cheese, I said that is fine leave it and add a side of potatoes. So I end up paying $2 for one 50 cent side of potatoes! Where is the fiesta potatoes you also charged me for? I said leave it, not as in leave it out of my bag but charge me for it.
