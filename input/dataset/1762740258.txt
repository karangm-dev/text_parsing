800 Degrees has been my favorite pizza place for the past 2 years! I would eat there every single day if I could! My favorite is the Verde (basil pesto) base. Every single topping they have is delicious! I especially love the mushrooms, tomatoes, shredded chicken, soppresata, artichokes, broccolini, and calabrian chile sauce (this stuff is just enough salty & spicy)! I love the location of the restaurant and that it offers patio seating as well as indoor. I wish there was one closer to my house!
