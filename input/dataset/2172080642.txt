I ordered a tuna sandwich which was very heavily peppered. It wasn't bad, but not something I would order if I knew before hand. They were nice enough to replace the tuna with a chicken salad sandwich. Took them no time at all. The guy was really nice. The sandwich was nothing special but the service was fantastic.
