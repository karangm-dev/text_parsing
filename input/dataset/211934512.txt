So Mary and her husband came out and assembled a few pieces. Some large, some small. All in all they did a very good job and were polite. I think that we extended the same courtesy. We actually asked them to come back and do another small job. We needed fixtures attached to all our cabinets and drawers. Mary quoted me a price, which I accepted and we agreed on a date. On the day they were suppose to come out, about an hour before our scheduled time, Mary texted and told me her husband had a flat tire and that they'd be late. I told her, no problem. I was ok. Then......SILENCE. Never heard back from her again. I texted a few more times to reschedule, I asked her if everything was alright, I even asked if they were OK? I know Mary got my messages because I had gotten read receipts. She just completely ignored me. It was all very strange. So, for the work they did I'd rate them a four but for the appointment cancellation and non responsiveness Id give them  a zero if I could. Stephen W. said " They're real pros" I beg to differ. Professionals who own and run their business should always respond to it's customers.
