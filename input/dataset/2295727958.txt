Worst Pizza Hut ever.  Management hung up on me after I called to let them know the pizza they had just delivered to me was not what I ordered. Manager told me I couldn't have ordered spinach on the cherry bomb pizza because it didn't come with it. I told him I had the confirmation email and then his story changed to they were out of product so I couldn't have ordered it.  After going back and forth for a minute he finally begrudgingly said he would credit my account for the next time. I said that would be fine if there was a next time because every time I order a pizza from this store it is ALWAYS wrong. He then hung up on me. How unprofessional.  Order from Napoli's instead. I thought I would give pizza hut one more try due to the new menu. NEVER AGAIN.  Oh yeah and the pizza tasted like cardboard. Steer clear of this one.
