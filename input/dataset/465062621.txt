We took our cousins here for there farewell dinner. My husband had been here numerous time with friends and he's always raving about it. However, it was the first time for me and I found their food delicious, service prompt and the ambiance perfect for dining out with friends and family. I would recommend this restaurant to try for sure. I'll for sure will be back. We had their miso soup, prawn tempura, Cajun roll, spicy tuna roll, flames roll and one more from their signature menu, I can't remember the name. Everything was awesome.
