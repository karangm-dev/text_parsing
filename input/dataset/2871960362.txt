Amazing and beautiful to witness.   Sat pretty high up, but the seats were still great.  The sound is effing amazing - I dont' know if I've ever heard the Beatles sound this good.After the show, be sure to check out the Beatles lounge, which is a Beatles-themed bar that only plays Beatles' songs - except at 10 p.m., it turns into a gay non-Beatles bar...
