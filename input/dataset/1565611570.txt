I have been here three times on Fri and Sun. This place is so cool! Asian vibe, good service and delicious dishes. The waitress always served big smile and nice attitude even though it was a busy day. About the dishes, i really recommend 'Buttered squid' and 'Tsuki roll'. They said these are signature menu. you wanna visit here again? Of course I do!!
