This is without a doubt the best place to have brunch. The food is restaurant quality in a fast casual setting. And their mimosa are always delicious. Scrambled eggs taste great, bacon is always cooked perfectly, hash browns are always cleaned off the plate, it's just a great place to have breakfast. I've heard some good things about their coffee as well, so I might give it a try the next time I'm there. They have a pet friendly patio seating area so you can take your pets their as well. If you're looking for a good Sunday brunch without waiting 30 minutes, this is the place.
