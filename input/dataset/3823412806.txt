I am definitely not someone who actively seeks out vegan friendly restaurants, but the menu here caught my attention. There were TONS of tempting items to choose from... ultimately my wife and I shared the Cauliflower Tacos, Potato Tacos, and Street Corn. All I can say is "Wow!". The food here is fantastic! Not just in flavor, but in presentation and sheer  creativity in the flavor combos. Never in a million years did I expect a restaurant that specializes in vegan and vegetarian fare to be one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix, however this place earned its spot near the top of the list of places I'll be frequenting on a regular basis. Absolutely delicious.
