First time trying Genos. The food is pretty good, but that's not why I gave it 2 stars. I ordered full mushrooms and they only put them on half ($3 charge for full coverage) and the women at the counter insisted she didn't have our order so i went to make sure it got placed and noticed we got charged a second time. My boyfriend went in and showed her the two charged and the women argued with him that there was nothing she could do. We work right down the street where we use this site so we knew that was a load of crap. She said she took care of it, but we'll have to wait and see if she really did.
