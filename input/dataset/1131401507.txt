Clean nail salon and spa. The staff is very friendly and helpful. My daughter had her nails done for prom and also a pedicure and I just had a manicure. The prices were also not bad, I've paid more at other salons ,so my daughter and I are very pleased with the services we received. The friendliest nail salon and spa I've been to in awhile.
