I came in for a consultation about a cracked tooth and it was found I needed a root canal. As many can imagine this is an unpleasant and anxiety provoking, however necessary, experience. The moment the endodontist walked in the room he introduced himself and without delay proclaimed his strong political views, with some unflattering comments about the opposing side's views. I don't usually make my healthcare choices based on political leanings--it really shouldn't affect how well I am cared for. But I am in a vulnerable position, nervous about a procedure I had heard horror stories about, and had no choice but to hear this stranger-doctor's (obnoxious) opinions. Knowing the candidate he is proudly supporting, should I have dissented I would have been in fear of my safety. This doctor had every right to believe what he wants; but I also work as a surgical healthcare provider and my workplace strongly frowns upon discussing divisive issues. Patients need to feel accepted and calm and that their issues and health are why they are in the office to begin with--it is about them, not the doctor. His behavior was markedly unprofessional and reflected poorly on his education, his integrity, and his office. I have shared my experience with coworkers and friends and will not recommend nor visit this office in the future.
