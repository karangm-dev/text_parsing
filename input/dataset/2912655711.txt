We came here on Thursday, January 18th around 9 a.m., before we had to drive back to California.I absolutely loved our waitress, Kaylee! She was stellar.The restaurant was nice and clean, the food was excellent. Those pancakes are the bomb. The food came out fast, and Kaylee even made perfectly sure my mom got extra crispy hash browns. Our order was accurate. Thanks for giving us such a great breakfast. And again, I can't stress how great Kaylee is (:
