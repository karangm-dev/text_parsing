I will preface this review by saying that I have been a long time Aveda customer. I've never had a bad experience in an Aveda salon. That said, some experiences stand out more than others. Recently moving to Las Vegas from Denver, I was nervous about finding a new stylist. I was loyal to my Aveda stylist in Denver for over 5 years and loved every cut, color, and experiment.Today I took the plunge and scheduled a haircut as I desperately needed about a foot of hair chopped.I met Jessica, and she immediately put me at ease. She listened to my stories of how my hair has changed over the course of a pregnancy, she understood my challenges as a busy mom, and she wisely offered advice on some face framing and bang maintenance.She was funny, smart and personable.And that's just the beginning of Jessica's amazing work.After relieving me from about 4 pounds of hair, Jessica so beautifully framed my face and shaped my hair to a magnificent style.Please don't miss this salon. From the massaging shampoo chairs to the fabulous stylists, they will leave you looking your best.
