This is my very first bike! JT was very helpful along with his staff! Very friendly and they really take their time to help you and find what you need! I was there for a really long time but i never got the feeling that i was an annoyance. They really take go out of their way to make sure you get all the answers to make an informed decision. Nonetheless, I would highly recommend coming here!
