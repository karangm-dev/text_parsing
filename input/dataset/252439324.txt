Hmm.  Just a typical B & N, but where I get annoyed is with the cashier trying to guilt me into buying their membership.  Years ago I did the math on this thing and by paying $25/year to get a 10% discount you'd have to spend $250/year to break even.  I don't spend $250/year at B & N.  Now, I think they've made some changes where you can get more of a discount than that on the 2nd Tuesday in August of a leap year or something.  However, I'm more of an indie or used bookstore or library kinda gal.  But, I really overall have nothing against B & N.  Once in awhile I'll stop in and raid the newsstand, which always has a good selection of materials for me to read when I'm procrastinating doing something else.So on Monday I find my way to the cashier with my random stack of reading materials and the cashier asks me twice if I want their membership.  Both times I politely said, "No, that's ok".  Then she says, looking at me sideways, "You know, SOME people add up how much they spend every year here and are SHOCKED and DISAPPOINTED when they figure out how they could have benefited from the discount."  tick tick tickYou know what.....That passive aggressive B.S. really turned me off.  I'll get my magazines elsewhere.
