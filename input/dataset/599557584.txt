Meal portions are huge here! Don't be fooled into thinking you will still be hungry after ordering here. My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast for the first time and our waitress Tanya was amazing. She was so helpful and kind. She even got us their famous banana nut muffins in honor of our first time. Must try!
