We ate here for the first time, and my husband is threatening to never eat in another restaurant on this block again. He wants to come back and order the mild chicken dhaba again, and again, and again. I had the medium tarka daal. The garlic naan was well done. Nice service and reasonable prices. We'll be back (obvi).
