I went to this salon because it is close by but I will not be returning anytime soon. My tech was very courteous and attentive and I was seen in a timely manner; however, for the price I paid I was expecting a much better end product. These are my gel nails 5 days after being seen in this salon. I would show pictures of my pedicure but 8/10 toes were chipped so I removed the polish and redid it myself. This salon is very clean and the staff is friendly and helpful but if you are looking for a high quality pedicure or gel mani, save your money and go elsewhere.
