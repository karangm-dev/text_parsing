i would put 0 if it was offered. it is like pulling teeth to get them to show up on time, not cancel. or take 3 months to fix my phone correctly. thye sent me a "flyer " with my bill promising an 'around the clock service' offer. thye offered $20.00 off your bill if they did not show up ...canceled ... or came late...! but when it took them from jan - march to get my line repaired they had cancelled and been late and now ...will not honor their gaurantee? i have been with them 12 years and hate their customer service and their tech support "practices" ... basically mis-treating their customers...
