One person working and 7 cars waiting. Not only am I handicap waiting 20 minutes but I am going to miss my flight. According to the worker, who is taking his sweet time per car there is only one worker on Sunday's. I called the main number and he said he would bring someone down. When he did he just asked if I was the one who called and then turned around and left. Wow. Can't wait to talk to ADA about this.
