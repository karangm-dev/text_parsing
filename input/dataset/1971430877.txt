I couldn't leave the parking lot without posting this !!! If I could give this bank 0 star I would!!! The worst bank to treat business owners!!! I have a business account and no matter how busy or how slow they are, they will always make me wait FOREVER when I make the business line or merchant line. If you're a business owner don't come to this place. Go to the one on Rainbow and Westcliff. They will treat 100 times better than all this horrible employees at the windows here !!!  What's the point on having a business line for if you still treat us equal. Should get rid of that line if not gonna be priority !!!
