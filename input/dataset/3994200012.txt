Don't go here on a Friday from 5-7. The pizza is anything but fast. Fast is the first word on their homepage so that's sort of their thing- until they get busy. Twice it has taken over 20 minutes for our order. The last time I was in the pizza took more than 40 minutes and they made one wrong so the second time they made it it was undercooked. So, that's the last time.
