Only my second maybe third time in life in Outback. I came late because that's how I roll. I really don't enjoy a crowd.  Headed straight for the bar which was pleasantly open. Kayla was my bartender, made me a flavored ice tea because I didn't want water or regular unsweetened ice tea. Cheers to that and then she made the the huckleberry moonshine cocktail, only 140 calories. My meal was a 11oz center cut steak, sweet potato and brocoli and cheese. All the food was deliciously seasoned. I'll be back
