We were very disappointed with the Bellagio Buffet. Luckily we had a skip the line pass and were able to bypass the enormous line - there is no way this buffet is worth even a 1 minute wait let alone the $40 per person price (plus another $15 per person for all you drink). The selection was very limited and food quality not great.  For example - no proper ice cream for desert, just cheaply made sugary soft serve from a self serve machine. All up for 2 adults, we paid $130 which included the buffet, unlimited selected drinks and the tip. Total waste of a $130. Last year we tried the MGM buffet which was definitely better quality with a much larger selection.
