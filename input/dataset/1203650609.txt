This is my third visit to this salon. I have to say my expierence has been a very good one. I get dip nails and regular pedicures. This is a very clean salon. The staff are nice and friendly. They take their time and do not rush you. The owner knows a lot of the customers by name. The price is reasonable to other salons in the area. The dip nails last and do not lift, crack or break. The have a large selection of colors and are helpful with suggestions and styling. I am happy to say this is my new SPOT!
