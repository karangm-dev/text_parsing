Last night I went there before they closed  I needed to try on some things for work had to know if it would fit . When I asked to try them on they said the dressing room closes at 7:30pm and I was unable to  use the dressing room. This Sounds a little ridiculous considering you're open till midnight so I had to buy items in different sizes so I could have the right outfit for work. I found the situation to be something they could've easily rectified no one working there wants to help ,they could have come up with a solution! Very lazy workers
