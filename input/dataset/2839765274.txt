Purchased their Groupon a few months ago, after being impressed by all the great reviews.  Called in December to book an appointment, no call back.  Called in January to make an appointment, no call back.  February... same thing.  The Groupon expires 2/21/17 so now instead of getting a "bumper to bumper scratch and blemish repair" for my car, I now have the headache of somehow getting a refund.  Very strange.
