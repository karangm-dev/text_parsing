i live close to the Star Nursery on Blue Diamond.  Moved here from Deadwood about 6 months ago.  I have to say that this is the best nursery i've been to. I've been dealing with Marco there and he had the best advice on how much sod to buy and just how to prep the soil before i laid the sod down.  I gave him the measurements of where i wanted it, and he was spot on with the amount I got.  Thank you Marco and Star Nursery.  the best....
