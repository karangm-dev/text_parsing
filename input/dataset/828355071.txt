Patron is a great option for a group of friends to get together and have some space to chill and catch up. I think that's what I liked the most that unlike most restaurants around the area, you weren't on top of other people and could keep your conversation private without whispering.The food was great too. I ordered Taquitos Mexicanos and they were delicious! My friends ordered a dessert that I don't remember the name of but essentially was a fried tortilla with ice cream and they scarfed it down.I would definitely come back and definitely with a large group of people.
