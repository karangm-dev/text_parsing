We came to Beatles Love for our anniversary date night.  Cirque and The Beatles whats not to love?  This was my first time seeing the show.  I know a few friends who are not happy with the updates to the show recently.  Since I didn't have anything to compare it to I wasn't disappointed.  I loved the show from start to finish.  You don't have to be a super fan to enjoy this show.  I like The Beatles but pretty much know the hits.  They did a great job.  Typical Cirque show where so much is going on.  Amazing stunts and beautiful imagery.  I think unless you really don't like The Beatles music will you enjoy this show.  I was a little distracted by the sheets of fabric separating the audience.  Eventually they came down but they blocked our view for a portion of the show.
