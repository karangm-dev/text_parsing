Recommended by a work colleague, this market carries some of the best asian foods and products I have been able to find in Vegas. Reasonably priced, this market offers quality nori, frozen gyoza, Thai/Korean/Japanese spices and sauces, soy wrap paper, pre-cut fish for sushi, fresh veggies and AMAZING salmon steaks. I went in for a quick look and ended up spending over an hour just browsing around. The staff is pretty friendly and will accommodate your requests (meat department).The prices at this market are right on par with any other grocery store in Las Vegas, so if you are in the mood to try exotic spices or different foods, come shop here. Some of the things I found here are:* Nori (quality stuff)* Salmon Steaks* Sushi grade salmon/tuna* Pre-cut fish for sushi* Sushi rice* Loco Moco sauce* Apple-Pears* Amazingly fresh ginger* Fresh pork bellyIf you are going to this market for the first time, do it with time to spare so you can browse around and find some pretty cool stuff.
