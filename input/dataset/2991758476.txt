So, I'm an Arsenal fan, and this is just the best spot in TO to come watch a match, hands down. This is the only way I've experienced Scally's and the atmosphere is awesome, the staff friendly, and the breakfast options are also great. And the Moroccan cigars...beautiful.Sadly, I cannot give it more than 2 because the BEER sucks. When it comes down to it, this is a bar, and any time I come here, I'll have breakfast and tea, but won't touch the beer. If you're lucky, about the best beer you can find is something from Mill Street. I made the mistake once of ordering a draft macro lager and it was disgusting. I like good beer, so it was a mistake to order that in the first place, but damn this beer was skunky. I couldn't bring myself to finish it. And that's too bad, because when I come to watch a match, I'm there for 2-3 hours and I'd consume a generous amount of beer, if it tasted good. Could you not stock some bottles of some decent beer rather than the swill that you're serving. I'd imagine that some of your clientele would appreciate it. Those that don't have plenty of macro lagers to choose from.
