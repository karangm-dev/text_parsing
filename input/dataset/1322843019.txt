It was amateur night at the Wolf. This theatre is old and the acts they book are miserable C level talent. Last night, a Hypnosis show never even got off the ground due to lack of customers. There were eight people in the audience and hopefully nobody paid full price or ever would for this lame show. I paid $5 as a hotel guest which was refunded at the end of the horrid attempt at putting on a show. The hypnotist said he needed 9 people and others in the audience to watch. He really had no explanation when I asked him after the show why he couldn't just hypnotize two people like I have seen multiple times. This guy's act relies on 9 people? What an amateur and he had that blonde spiky hairdo which usually indicates scammer. The opening act was even more of a joke. Who actually books these people. It was some dude named balloon master, who purchased some balloons somewhere and then made dirty jokes about them for about 6 minutes. He throws all his stuff into two garbage bags and tosses some penis shaped balloons into the crowd of guys. He is like the homeless guy carrying his balloons around with them in his car trunk probably. Go see a real hypnosis show on the real strip. This night was a disaster, try some promotions or get a better act cause these vtwo dudes were not off-strip ready, they were just awful.
