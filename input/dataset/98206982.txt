I really can't find any reason to not give Fleming's 5 stars.  Is it absolutely the best meal I have ever had, no, but pretty darn good.  We have been going to Fleming's for years and will continue to do so.  Yes, it is expensive for a typical night out so it's not a go-to that often for us but we still really enjoy the little splurge every now and again.  Fleming's is a great date night or special occasion place with friends.I typically get the petite filet with the 3oz add-on shelled lobster tail.  The filet is always cooked to perfection and extremely tasty.  The lobster looks small when it is served but is always the right amount for me.  We almost always get a few sides and last night was no different.  We had our standard creamed spinach (my fav), Fleming's potatoes and creamed corn (I wasn't a huge fan of the creamed corn as it was a little spicy and that's not my thing).  The service is always excellent.  Almost forgot to mention that I love the Farmer's Daughter Martini...Delicious!  But beware, they go down quickly!It's always a nice night out at Fleming's.  Just writing this review is making me hungry!!
