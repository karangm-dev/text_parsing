Dr. Rotstein is one of the nicest and most caring dentists I have ever been to.  He was so absolutely fair in his assessment of my gum condition and made sure to get the issue cleared up before he would consider work on my teeth.  I was amazed to find someone who won't "soak" you with a huge bill.  Great pricing and his staff are super nice...he will be the only dentist I go to from now on...
